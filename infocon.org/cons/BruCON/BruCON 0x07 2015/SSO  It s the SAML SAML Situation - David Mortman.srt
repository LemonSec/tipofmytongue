1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,629
next speaker David is also one of the
people that presented couple of times

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:13,840
here at home so this time he's going to
entertain us with some of single sign-on

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:25,750
and the pain and funded goes with it so
please in a round of applause I thought

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,000
I was struggling for you guys I'm so to
speak

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,350
thanks for having me again this is my
roommate my third book on and so excited

6
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,890
to be back so just a little bit about
myself so I'm David workman the chief

7
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,020
security architect Adele software and
somehow convince someone to ask me to

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,700
take a Distinguished Engineer which is
impressive and I don't write code that

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,880
you know ask the driver trains or build
bridges so you know that's so the thing

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,860
is an attack today about about identity
single sign-on Federation

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,179
the whole authorization and
authentication space and frankly this is

12
00:01:06,179 --> 00:01:12,969
a sad story there's no happy ending to
this topic anymore and you know that

13
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,318
there's no good news here

14
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,149
news we'll see what happens as we as we
go through this this is the great things

15
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:28,819
are kind of a cluster and no idea
generally this is a huge problem out

16
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:35,659
there really i mean it's hard this is a
hard problem so bad at it we're really

17
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,719
really done it if you look at things
like the Verizon reports every year that

18
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:47,408
phrasing is done the DAR but six seven
years ago know every single year with

19
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:53,209
the biggest debtors is identity default
passwords

20
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:58,369
reuse pretty much most of the major
breaches that have happened for

21
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,450
restaurants and SMB is refusing point of
sale terminals that are basically PCs or

22
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Macs everything when the beaches is
because a vendor who supplies these to

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,210
the customers use the same

24
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:18,200
password everywhere it's it's like it's
like taking candy from a toddler really

25
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,790
and actually it's easier than taking
candy from a toy drive a five year old

26
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,570
building that other I don't get any of
Halloween candy you know they're really

27
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,260
protect the hold on tighter to their
candy then then we hold onto passwords

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:39,329
honestly have kids remember passwords
for us but it has red star star star

29
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,550
star star star star star but you'd
probably get it you know that in

30
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:50,280
managing passwords when you start
looking at these

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,680
reaches the point of sale terminals the
username password everywhere and it's my

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,110
way of course admin level password and
then when the mystery and stick with it

33
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,380
is they just in the entire internet and
I find all the thousands of machines

34
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,380
they can get into it the same password
Chris alluded to this earlier in his

35
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,230
opening two I don't use the same
password everywhere

36
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:20,700
don't story in clear text but the thing
is my slides it's also really boring ok

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,060
so who here has to manage a dent in the
other regular basis in reason number is

38
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,590
that you look forward to that do you say
you know what I really want any

39
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,760
management metrics today that's that's
what excites me

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,670
know it's boring it's really really
boring and mention that were bad at it

41
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,548
would really really like that it's a
good thing is this is not rocket science

42
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:58,220
take the user password credential when
they change the rules I just their

43
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,810
authorization when they leave the
company just evil that password but

44
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,659
turns out this is not complicated
complex it's not even that complicated

45
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,560
but it is really hard and that's the
thing is that you know it's not rocket

46
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,159
science

47
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:18,599
anyone who's here at make keynote two
years ago I rented a lot about how I W

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,669
insecurity is not rocket science it's
but it's boring and you know I for one

49
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,380
would much rather go home when I get
home next week certainly with all the

50
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,770
new things that Amazon announced that
our security related services at some

51
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,039
cool stuff is configured management
there's there's some really high level

52
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,169
stuff that makes it all the more secure
but the reality is that a bunch of time

53
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,659
talking with folks on the product teams
out how to make it any easier to manage

54
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,780
and we'll all be bored but it is not
exciting it's not see it doesn't you

55
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,440
know doesn't generate good headlines it
certainly doesn't you know get good

56
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,219
press even if things like the RSA
Conference which is all about getting

57
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,639
press releases out and it's even bring
the authorizations this which is a whole

58
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:14,000
different world busy so i guess its
basic but it's not easy pouring in and

59
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,919
let's get the authorization to get even
more boring it's a big you know anybody

60
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,320
NY NY in church trying to go who gets
get more into the authorization stuff

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,460
leader but me when you think about it
because preachers we had like this is a

62
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,448
general breach several years ago a
trader balance back and forth between

63
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,620
the front and the front office in the
back office and he kept his access to

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,060
the throne in systems in the backend
systems he could defraud the back cover

65
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,169
his own tracks to the tune of

66
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:49,340
something like two or three billion
dollars in trade fraud because we have

67
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,869
basic you know move edge teams as his
jazz routine within a company in this

68
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,400
should never have happened except for
the part where it's not the easiest task

69
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,698
to do and yes it's exponentially harder
every time you add an identity

70
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:10,830
management and its not meeting your
passwords really this is where we are in

71
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,698
2015 we had passwords on our systems for
30 40 50 years in the state of the art

72
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,259
for most people is a password

73
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:27,580
a character's generally maybe if you're
lucky you can get down to six Amazon

74
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,919
actually lets you view as few as i think
is he was six and you know there's no

75
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,349
complexity requirements they don't care
they want your money it's worth it for

76
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:37,900
them over typically an enterprise
environment you know your eight to 10

77
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:45,248
characters numbers characters symbols
case lower case DNA sampling retina

78
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:50,319
Prince you know the name of your first
girlfriend boyfriend dog whatever you

79
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,479
can do to change it every every 30 to 60
days if you know where I work every 60

80
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,219
days it's good to have a password
manager that's me

81
00:06:58,219 --> 00:07:01,449
generate random passwords and they never
have to take them anywhere because

82
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,060
otherwise I'd be doing the same thing if
one else does which is you know posted

83
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,649
nude and changing the last digit or
something on the password ok honestly

84
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:16,169
who uses a password manager nice I think
that's the best response ever get any

85
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:21,818
security conference even think you guys
right way to deal with that password

86
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:30,030
problem sir you know so then there's

87
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,950
your passwords multi-factor could suffer
a mostly except for a lot of people are

88
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,800
still really hard I mean so security who
did not have to use actual physical

89
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,540
security token

90
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,000
a similar one that could change your
hands up still in that fun UK more than

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,730
one dead I had one job headache for
teaching which one is it you know this

92
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:04,480
is not you think you saw it in principle
it's a great idea but it's not really

93
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,360
user friendly and I think you need
someone who is currently have this thing

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,200
out this is one place where actually
meet some great progress of this

95
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:19,500
affiliation with Google Google
authenticator is also using Google

96
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,680
navigator yeah it's great isn't it
likely solves a lot of problems as long

97
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,390
as you don't actually wake your phone
without a backup place becomes supremely

98
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,140
painful to recover from so I hope you
all have saved somewhere that's not on

99
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,830
your phone that printed out code so you
can get back into your phone for the

100
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,090
earth

101
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,460
the other thing that I love in this this
is that Google was added to the only

102
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,810
have two multi-factor authentication
like once a month at a Greek compromise

103
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,170
in terms of usability an average user ok
so once a month later pulled the phone

104
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,140
out and used it to get to a dedicated

105
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,230
SMS that seems like a nice compromise
rate it's not quite as efficient as

106
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,820
every time you're going to use it but it
seems like a nice compromise is actually

107
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,760
I like this actually I'm a big fan of
this solution just looking at fado this

108
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,250
looks pretty cool I have to say they
just get home just announced integration

109
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,440
with Fido

110
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,520
and a unique easy you just have your you
be key in youth indicate to get a

111
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,550
certificate basic things like that I
haven't dug deep into that at this looks

112
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,790
promising for an individual user
perspective for doing some nice pretty

113
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,770
secure a multi-factor authentication we
tied into something a water sample some

114
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,230
potential long-term potential as
individual consumers to solve some good

115
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:47,140
so to solve some problems but as I seen
the general problem is that every time

116
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,230
especially organisations a denied any
medical in point someplace new or used

117
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,730
to manage users that job of whoever job
is to manage ended he gets exponentially

118
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,080
harder just looking at a dedication this
means you know one more place that you

119
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,960
need to disable user

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,950
this is what I get when we disable user
another place to add a user changes

121
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,070
things happen so we came along with you
we said we need some sign on this way we

122
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,250
centralized that usually password into a
single place single point of failure to

123
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,460
appoint a compromise but ease of use for
new users so they started with single

124
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:35,240
sign-on fifteen years ago at least and
we're still terrible it's not that

125
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,150
complicated I have to put a few of these
systems over the years but even today

126
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,520
when the clients I work with youth
indicate to the first half by the way we

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,180
go to website it's a non to third
parties

128
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,500
single sign enabled using I think pain
but it actually irrelevant with whoever

129
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:03,450
whatever the vendor is and when I get is
in eg basic proper 2013 and getting

130
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:11,540
encouraging users to type in any city
basic probably let you know

131
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,060
training people with rain sure to take
your password Arena box that pops up you

132
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,939
have no way to authenticate that even
came from great space and then go to the

133
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,220
next after I have to work again in a VPN
into the client every time a new web

134
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,160
page sometimes they have to do that
again and again because it has no

135
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,780
concept of a non-windows user
authentication and I have an agent that

136
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,589
supposed to do that as well so this this
still sucks on his opinion we started

137
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:44,680
out these four first ladies proprietary
systems you know SiteMinder you ever

138
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,310
received minor no see a product and then
we had no idea they have a Web seal

139
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,699
their security which owns now there's
there's a host of others but basically

140
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,430
there are currently proprietary
protocols and we said yes they sort of

141
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,750
work as long as we are inside her
enterprise using no third party apps and

142
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:11,680
you're on Windows indicated to the do
mean it mostly kind of works as long as

143
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,589
you're running IE six service pack 2
with the following hotfixes and it's a

144
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,470
Tuesday in the moon is it you know is
waning and waxing opinion which

145
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:28,850
configuration options he said you know
what Microsoft ask for payment and the

146
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,680
old friend apparently it was microsoft's
attempt to do

147
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,750
internet-based single sign-on and
everyone said no we don't trust you to

148
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,760
do that and then holding company just
kidding son and SGI probably Dell and HP

149
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,080
who also said we're gonna come up with
the the liberty federation Liberty

150
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,550
project for doing an open source
Federation and no one replied that even

151
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,150
answer that wasn't what we need we need
open source who did it not open sources

152
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,650
that we need an open standard for
federal first single sign-on bonus

153
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,829
federation army came up with WS said

154
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:13,380
XML 'I think you and it turned out that
aw said was heavily backed by Microsoft

155
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:22,020
and as a result of politics and what not
only people who actually use WS dead arm

156
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,060
was Microsoft Microsoft partners so it
works it works today if you're a

157
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,920
complete hundred percent Microsoft shop
it works pretty well for senator

158
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,540
duration with indicate against your
Active Directory there with your YouTube

159
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,439
password or multi-factor authentication
kind of does the job but no one has a

160
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,020
pure maker sub shop today and decently
work with anything that's cloud-based

161
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,110
because no one is almost no one is
actually running things that make us

162
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,500
after the club would guess it doesn't
work with your sales forces or workday

163
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,470
or whoever you using Fourier

164
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,570
concurred or any other sort of
third-party cloud-based apps you're

165
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:09,610
using and soon after that we got some
pretty cool it's it's pretty secure you

166
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:17,130
know lots of certificate based
authentication between components family

167
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,540
is it only on the mir

168
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,300
however anyone here deployed sample did
you try to reduce want you only you know

169
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,579
i mean the thing about family is that so
much of the sample the obvious there's

170
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,870
actually more optional portions of the
standard then there are required

171
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,990
fortunes of the standard when I look at
similar I think of the old Tenenbaum

172
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,990
quote about the one thing that standards
is there's so many to choose from

173
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:48,240
that's pretty much the same the same
case with with options when you get into

174
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,470
a complete nightmare I have never seen
in integration between two different

175
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,130
providers or work without custom
engineering not once it's hard enough to

176
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,420
get we're going to all the same product
to suit you trying to make especially

177
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,560
when you open source versions talk to a
commercial version or even to commercial

178
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,989
version stuck to each other they are all
standards compliant

179
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:15,950
but they've chosen different options to
support different criteria support and

180
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,180
most of them actually have yet to see a
single sample provider that properly

181
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,859
support all the requirements even a
complex most notably missing a single

182
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,110
logout doesn't think the missing from a
single sign-on products is the ability

183
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,620
to get out of it when you know when
you're single sign-on able you know you

184
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,720
go you could log out your application

185
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320
really means is that you quit out of
that window if you go back to the

186
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,260
product

187
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,149
authenticated automatically your back in
several actually requires that you have

188
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:48,209
a single logout options he did go to the
IDP or even from within a single app

189
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:57,279
when you click logout it's like
everything as a result is no one single

190
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,990
complaining as I was working with a
product team and I said we need to log

191
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,790
out and is it what's the only for the
identities folks in the lockout is

192
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,060
clicking the backgrounds of murdering
alright they just put the same report

193
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,630
profile has endeavoured that he years
ago when I first learned by central so

194
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,890
it's hard to make work together

195
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,490
nightmare I've had nightmares trying to
place

196
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,760
providers it's not fun ahead of myself
so I get past the HDD basic this happens

197
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:38,430
a lot more with settle anything else in
fact samples such a pain to settle this

198
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,319
concept of an identity provider it's
basically a proxy that sits between the

199
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,020
app you're trying to authenticate to and
you're back in directory it gently sits

200
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,230
on the on the Internet age your gateway
is like that and it

201
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,339
proxies the requests back and forth so
that way you get the right directory

202
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:55,649
things like that

203
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,839
now this is another key point for most
companies that there's actually an

204
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,150
entire market people who are doing just
posted at nearly providers just struck

205
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,199
see it sits there on the internet and
communicates after your directory or

206
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:13,730
whatever you're using for your back into
indications here and they provide

207
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,410
whatever happens to be simplified they
just got acquired by RSA

208
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,770
doctor they're doing quite well

209
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,168
microsoft has a DFS which is basically
ninety I did you get through our shore

210
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,880
or you can host your own but this is how
problematic the spaces that we generated

211
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,169
a you know twenty fifty million dollar
market at least 10 2012 little piece of

212
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:44,290
it because it's such a pain point for
enterprises that's what you got going on

213
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:52,290
that's kind of a kind of a problem and
then we have anyone else you know i

214
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,879
three you see the most likely you've
seen it as you indicated anything from

215
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,190
your phone so you know twitter facebook
facebook doesn't lead to a third party

216
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,480
clients like I used to eat but for
dinner when you indicate to it when you

217
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,780
think it to Twitter you actually get
this app you don't have your dreams into

218
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,530
the appetite redirects you to Twitter's
login page and youth indicate there and

219
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:21,700
say I'm authorizing this device and this
is an important thing is that is used as

220
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,230
an authentication protocol but
technically it's an authorization

221
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:32,730
protocol you're basically telling an app
or web or mobile app that you have the

222
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,950
ability that you're now authorizing that
device with an application to act on

223
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,550
behalf of the user authentication
authorization authorizing something and

224
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,389
that works reasonably well on individual
consumer basis but still this means that

225
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,130
this is designed to any good for
organizations that have this is its

226
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,540
reopening its next-generation OpenID
easily great as internal user

227
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,110
authenticate

228
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:07,449
tweet but instead of the default Twitter
client had the excitement there's

229
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,540
multiple versions of us there is one
which has all sorts of delicious

230
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:21,120
security features and encryption a
message sign in and all this good stuff

231
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,080
used by a few organizations in and beat
you came out all the security features

232
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:37,629
optional and frankly it's a game Busters
organization started using it to cost a

233
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:43,270
lot simpler to implement was less
complicated I think this is the BMX

234
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,010
problem I talked about this a few years
ago

235
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,740
REST and SOAP API is all sort of
reasonable definitions be one is the

236
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,500
better to use visits all the security
features there in just the right way

237
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,730
trademark copyright etcetera etcetera

238
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:10,360
any sort of standard definition that
better product but she too is like VHS

239
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,610
it easier to use its like rest it easier
to use its very friendly it's

240
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,209
inexpensive in comparison is lower
quality but it's it needs enough of a

241
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,790
need it meets the minimum requirements
for most people so that picked up a lot

242
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:31,320
easier to implement and deploy so we are
video instead that there is a D 333 s

243
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,200
turn into a political nightmare I think
it's premature doa at this point

244
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,420
enough people who were in the core
product or so pissed off a direction of

245
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,340
III they've quit the project just kind
of sitting there in the discussions are

246
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,209
going to rate TV for mature where things
stand without having to leave in

247
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,450
following the political machinations
there but the two and pragmatically

248
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,010
where we're at it has against it there's
no requirement for OAuth to use https

249
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,020
this message saying there's not there's
not a lot of security there it's all up

250
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,480
the provider another downside no such as
those really read this site today

251
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,440
because I was talking to folks and they
said oh it's cool but as a whole lot of

252
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,179
it I won't use because I'm on Facebook
and I want to use that application I

253
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:24,580
have to have a Facebook account I don't
use Facebook or I don't want to give

254
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,970
them access to my Google credentials are
appointed an absolute email me at the

255
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,220
school new app on LinkedIn

256
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,250
to the football kit is used to
authenticate

257
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:39,140
doing authentication against your
LinkedIn account the great thing but

258
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,900
essentially tells you what privileges
when you have new app on Android is

259
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,970
here's the thing that has access to a

260
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,990
gives you the ability to see that as
well so it's ok well you can see your

261
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,350
full profile that's fine everyone can
see my full profile might make full

262
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,969
profile whether there is any kids don't
care about that you can see all your

263
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:07,280
first in secondary connections like
about that that's usually the industry

264
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,710
to see my actions and that's it

265
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:18,330
email on your behalf as you email and
respond to your email for you on your

266
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:26,179
behalf and you had to cancel button but
it's just like no I mean you know it's

267
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,250
sort of one thing to say you can
indicate against

268
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:34,690
directory and quite another to let me in
person at you and everyone so this

269
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,130
actually stops a lot of people from
using some of these apps they don't want

270
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:47,770
any key with Prudential share some of
that show that actors back we having fun

271
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,830
yet because right now I mean this is
something like this exists more not less

272
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,530
than anything else and what does the
situations are so tend to you know get

273
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,889
UN officials in areas where it once you
get fished in any single sign-on

274
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,370
environments with passwords really
screwed if you just give access to

275
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:11,419
everything and you know frankly no hemos
corporate environments not a big deal

276
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,680
because most of us don't have access to
anything truly interesting in a

277
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,890
corporate environment actually have

278
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,300
no access to anything interesting my
current job which is critical

279
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:32,040
some people do so of course I used that
as an occasion because he said to give

280
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,500
you some level of protection so we're
back to the sort of general problems

281
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,260
faced so how are you gonna do that what
is what is your multi-factor is a

282
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,770
complete video is it gonna be

283
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,620
security is it gonna be Google
identicator and some of these work

284
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:52,209
better than others for enterprises and
what things that you think it was

285
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:55,660
something with the big differences
between you really think that you know

286
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,190
when I encounter central and that
nightmare vs 100 I think it's a whole

287
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,510
different areas that are symbols pretty
much enterprises organizational level

288
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,680
product not gonna see it is intended as
a typical user is running around doing

289
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,850
things you might like my bank is using a
sample for some god forsaken reason I

290
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,959
have no idea why because they only have
one directory but I suspect it's because

291
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,120
the outsourcer portion of the online
banking stuff so it's actually all

292
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:35,479
customers hiding but consumer product is
me certainly likely to encounter them

293
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,840
said opinion on your use case and
whether you're ready an application

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,610
consumer app or whether you're
supporting enterprise or somewhere in

295
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:50,409
between different places or you have
different make nearest opinion what your

296
00:24:50,410 --> 00:25:00,140
job is to manage these short and then to
add to the authorization space so I

297
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,230
think it's bad enough it's enough to
make people ill let me take my hair out

298
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:10,400
because his nightmares and it just me
with this is a huge problem and then you

299
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
get to authorization and its way

300
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,039
way way way WAY worse

301
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,408
indication by comparison authentication
is child's play

302
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:28,750
get to create the user credentials they
logon latest good authorizations a lot

303
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,100
worse and you know it's a first for a
lot of reasons one is the matrices which

304
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,949
they talked about at the beginning so
they need to figure out who can do what

305
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,200
when where and how and yeah it's not so
bad when you have 50 users have three or

306
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,070
four different things users might you
may have developed a system in

307
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,870
salesperson finance you have a couple
different rules it's not so complicated

308
00:25:51,870 --> 00:26:02,350
when I went to see so it's evil we had
five applications at the instance there

309
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,110
was an email there was it was it sells
force PeopleSoft and it was the

310
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:14,590
procurement system in like that's it for
55 told that patient's and our roles and

311
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:19,658
responsibilities matrices were a
nightmare it was Excel spreadsheet Excel

312
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:23,309
spreadsheet Excel spreadsheet mostly
because PeopleSoft and Siebel are so

313
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:27,580
complex that the roles and
responsibilities and things with no more

314
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,629
complicated nothing just five
applications training out who could do

315
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,850
what other shopper or we will update it
early and usually took a couple months

316
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:43,399
to rate the typical enterprise and I
shit you not have between five and ten

317
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,620
thousand applications when you're
looking at the fortune 500 the Forbes

318
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:56,219
2000 so just imagine just who can do
what most applications and then to make

319
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:03,539
matters worse each of those applications
has his own authorization system that's

320
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:12,190
built in need of lead to the application
this is why I say this is hard because I

321
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,940
mean you can have a full team of people
whose only drove it

322
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,850
hundred-year 365 days a year is to
figure out is to track these things and

323
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:28,699
you will still be firmly behind so we
need is it is we need a way of

324
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:34,870
centralizing authorization let's get
authorization out of the applications

325
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:41,129
where to get a centralized directory for
authorization much like we do with

326
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,520
authentication and the first of four
pretty good they said let's define group

327
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,440
you know you can grab groups of users on
the basis of things like Active

328
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,960
Directory LDAP so then the beast as
usual created you put them in the right

329
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,540
groups in a bid to mapped to the
appropriate rules within your

330
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,260
application that in a separate ourselves
so we still use your sewing you you can

331
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,740
move out of that group and they was
those roles that doesn't believe it's

332
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,730
incremental reporting incremental change
but doesn't solve the problem that you

333
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,420
start creating the policies and the
rules in an individual applications so

334
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:31,840
on came because we weren't her figure
that this makes WS said look it's

335
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:41,000
xml-based because XML is the future rate
thank you know it's awful it's so awful

336
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,770
that we came up with JSON yes I that bad
but it's still a decent actually a lot

337
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:56,570
better but that's a different story but
that makes similar look simple getting

338
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:03,980
into work rate it's a complete nightmare
it has some good parts though it really

339
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:11,590
introduced most of the world to the
concept of attribute base access control

340
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,560
sir

341
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,990
and attributes are really cool it's
usually fun stuff so like when after

342
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:25,980
work with is it a cloud thing and it
says only the person who owns a resource

343
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:31,590
in the cloud provider can terminate that
resource so means that you as a regular

344
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:38,470
user and in that group I could anyone
else's ec2 instance I can posit I can

345
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:45,230
stop it but i cant terminated unless I'm
the one who wanted it I think I should

346
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,120
share the story in a previous topic but
I was working earlier company we were

347
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,280
when you everything on Amazon and we
didn't have an estimate based access

348
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,120
control system in place and it's Friday
afternoon 5 o'clock my time prepping for

349
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,399
an upgrade in production and again I am
from one of our developer see I'm really

350
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:09,780
really sorry what do you mean you're
sorry he's responded back I'm really

351
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:22,190
really sorry that you would you do as
well as its lead developer I have full

352
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:27,350
admin credentials to the development AWS
account yeah I know I give those to you

353
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:32,240
and he said well I was thinking I was
doing some testing and I spun up some

354
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,270
resources nature needed them the other
ones they terminated them and then they

355
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:43,920
did it again and it could be sheen's
like Germany in my boxers didn't go away

356
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:52,040
a few more times and the boxes were
still there and instantly damp up his

357
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:59,790
head of my Cuban said I can't get to the
mean Oracle development database I can

358
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:05,649
get to it either turned out that Matthew
had it actually terminated all of the

359
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:13,250
development did business because we
don't have time to do something like he

360
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,380
can only truly the box is that he
started and so we cancelled the

361
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,300
production of it and I spent the next
several hours

362
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,230
restoring the databases virtually
they're good backups but still is Oracle

363
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:29,340
which meant that even with a good backup
it was you know for five hours to reroll

364
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,419
logs and all that stuff and other folks
I've talked to have a basic template

365
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,510
similar rules prevent those accidents
from happening it's amazing how often

366
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,750
those accidents happen when you have
called a code is in place for a group

367
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,920
suddenly think david hasn't either
resources I do I just blow it when he

368
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,490
started so that we're free up some cash
for my project it happens a lot

369
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,690
turns out people fat fingers things near
the end of budget cycles a lot of that

370
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,180
sort of thing or similar to do what you
say

371
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:12,350
attributes include things like / AP ok
I'm going to force anyone coming from

372
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,980
this IP range to use multi-factor
authentication because they never called

373
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:23,080
in from there before you know what
they're coming in from China they may be

374
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,240
in China double check that coming in
from the China IP address ranges then

375
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,010
they should indicate again but you
accurate indication that it's really

376
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:40,840
cool and they go really really well with
role-based access control so they can a

377
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:49,720
combination of two say are back on top
of each other but it turns out this is

378
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,020
still really hard problem

379
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,040
the typical organization who says
they're using Google lies they're not

380
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,530
using the concept is a pretty standard
keep you know devalue store or a little

381
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,330
needy some kind of thing and was known
uses exit after using XML and no one's

382
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,639
actually isn't a protocol standards are
vile unreadable

383
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,800
the samples are useless one reason we
actually have to I would be tempted to

384
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,500
actually write something that was better
but no one uses actually uses a

385
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:31,110
compulsory seems more important things
like you drink more good year so that

386
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:47,639
kind of mess all of these Apple shares
work for Oracle will let people draw

387
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,220
their own conclusions on the basis that
I was almost in Oracle employee for 24

388
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,060
hours which is a different story

389
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:02,260
mary ann loves me by the way to
demonstrate actually got her to fire me

390
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:09,230
before I got started asking me about
that one so they can say is that there's

391
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,190
a couple of this probably a hundred
enterprises underusing some satellite

392
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:17,850
thing they're the ones who are sort of
on the cutting edge of this stuff in

393
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,580
there are doing basic either your
stories using JSON instead of XML

394
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,649
because it's so much better when they're
basically the basic attributes thing and

395
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:30,100
using some sort of Active Directory or
LDAP to store these things its offer

396
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,969
custom in-house build applications so
it's not going to help you if you have

397
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,520
any sort of commercial applications
using an Oracle Siebel PeopleSoft for

398
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,460
now Oracle or any other sort of
commercial stuff like that I've yet to

399
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:52,080
find a SAS provider that supports
optimal find any certain powers or as

400
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,699
vendor that supports you know you can
prove things if you have a lot of

401
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,859
in-house applications but it really is
again it's incremental improvement in my

402
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,610
head

403
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,330
going to love fest here but it's still a
sad story there is no happy ending

404
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:12,560
there's no happy ending and site I
really don't have any advice for you

405
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,650
even on how to make things better other
then try your best to get some sort of

406
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:24,140
family thing working for your
organization and be willing to reality

407
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:31,259
resources to those really basic things
is holding a project is really really

408
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,950
boring and no one wants to do it I don't
want to do it I do it anyway

409
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:44,129
about that but we'll get into that and
you know the compliance folks don't

410
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,600
drive it hard enough for anyone to
really care they say oh good you have

411
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,420
your password changer requirements in
you have some sort of personal directory

412
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,320
and so until the incentive scheme
changes to get us to change anything

413
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,360
nothing's gonna change the complaint
regime is not required to do it

414
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,470
the executives across companies change
it

415
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,709
the CIA CISA don't have enough leverage
to make anyone jean jacket and no one

416
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:16,590
really wants to do so screwed and that's
my sad story for today so thank you for

417
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:52,120
coming out last year and questions I
have ever been a time where

418
00:36:52,120 --> 00:37:02,740
themselves and we did get three or four
is any of this

419
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,600
like either attribute based controls or
authorization showing up there so there

420
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:14,390
is not even v2 there's the ability to
sort of a sign classes of users so I

421
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:17,910
mean typically from most organizations
you get sort of this sort of the

422
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:24,089
readonly and read write and sort of
admin level sort of concept which is the

423
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:29,790
most bang for most organizations yet
like especially with web-based apps it's

424
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,440
usually the choices read all the rights
as a good Easter clip all actually put

425
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,530
things back as well in principle liamine

426
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,350
with both sound 10 author and principal
you can define attributes both in the

427
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:47,069
sort of broad sense this is what you can
do in the industry are back since as

428
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,610
well as a back simply don't have the
concepts built in these are not

429
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:56,080
leveraged your typical organization is
using SAML is defining the authorization

430
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,110
internally its own things and to the
extent of using sound 14 authorizations

431
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,440
they're just defining there's a certain
what group you should be in as a person

432
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,240
pre-populated that user within Active
Directory or something like that but all

433
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,870
the authorization levels are still
defined within the application within

434
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,470
the sample period but you could

435
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,649
principal do it basically no one knows
there's still too busy trying to make

436
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:32,900
you know the sample provider talk to the
IDP to talk to the database Dave glossed

437
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,520
over the fighting Alliance stuff you
speak a little bit more than that cuz it

438
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,580
seems promising

439
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,580
is really interesting Michael Barrett
who used to be the sea so it helps with

440
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,720
bob Riley on as well as pasta mins who
has four people have been around for a

441
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,439
while

442
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,609
project which these days ago called
implementation it's really need you to

443
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:59,770
come up with a standardized multi-factor
authentication approach that as much as

444
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:06,400
possible is centralized it is you're
focused said certificate based it lets

445
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,030
you do multi-factor haven't dug deep
into fighter yet it does look promising

446
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:19,420
as it released as a consumer based
product I have a pile of that and things

447
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:26,750
on my laptop and education to dig into
yet that is Terms of Use indications

448
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:31,920
that things were really promising to
have it fairly standardized process but

449
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,200
that would potentially displace but not
addressed the enterprise scale it would

450
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,950
it would it would say it's more of a
replacement for a better user names and

451
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,049
passwords as opposed to the ethnic it
certainly is an indication fix its not

452
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:51,240
modernization fix generally what you
really see these days with this is just

453
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,040
its second redirect from the app to the
appropriate point at the back in

454
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,720
directory provider so with Twitter when
you go to a nap if we dressing to the

455
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,410
actual Twitter login page that there are
three handles that co2 whatever they

456
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:15,560
would only be and then you would use
your password or traditional

457
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:22,500
multi-factor if you set it up with your
phone off or I know if they start to

458
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,759
Twitter start supporting it

459
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:28,219
someone would get us I could get her the
ideas you know that you don't use your

460
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:32,899
password you just touched the Yuba key
and then it sends off the appropriate

461
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:35,529
certain magic to make it happen

462
00:40:35,529 --> 00:41:38,470
things

463
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,430
some rice make sure I heard you
correctly the idea for one thing about

464
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:48,359
the idea behind video is to let you do
an assessment of the strengths of you

465
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,779
have your belief that users the user to
the basis of their device where they're

466
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,550
coming from is that you pay stuff as
well as to say how they have indicated

467
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:02,150
you know it's a surgery we're talking
like that too much more likely to be me

468
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,960
your fingerprint as opposed to a four
character password or six character

469
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:21,619
password or something like that somebody
else

470
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:32,269
OpenID I haven't looked at mean I
haven't looked a whole lot OpenID and

471
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:38,538
OAuth sort of replaced OpenID OpenID
connect which is basically the two with

472
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:45,660
some magic on top of it might mean I
mean I think it's fine when really well

473
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,899
in a consumer environment if you're
savvy enough to manage your own

474
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,390
authentication systems I think most
people aren't interested for asking for

475
00:42:56,390 --> 00:43:00,499
trouble but I mean that's you know we
get back in the states that was the

476
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:06,930
whole recent issue where it came out
that several officials at various levels

477
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,890
over the years have been managing their
own email servers most notably Hillary

478
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,529
Clinton recently but turns out most of
the secretaries of state for the last

479
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:18,009
like 15 years have managed had it all
their email and personal service they

480
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:22,259
are managing themselves as hard enough
to manage email when you're deeply

481
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:27,190
technically competent you spend a lot of
time on it and I think that's when you

482
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,650
know

483
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:33,299
directory security is sort of like those
three things you don't want to break you

484
00:43:33,299 --> 00:43:36,288
want to break the Guinness you don't
want to break in BGP and you don't wanna

485
00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:41,640
break your directory server this is a
three-course three-quarter legs that you

486
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,558
know a secure inexperienced relies on
his ya mi Cielo who I am who I say I'm

487
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:52,269
going to the right side and is the
routing actually bringing be there so I

488
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:55,769
think for most cases OpenID is a
nightmare waiting to happen for the

489
00:43:55,769 --> 00:44:06,459
typical user though I think that first
and small corner cases it makes sense

490
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,310
think everyone
