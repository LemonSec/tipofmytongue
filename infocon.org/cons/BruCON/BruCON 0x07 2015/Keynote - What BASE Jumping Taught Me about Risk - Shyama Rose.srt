1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,580
present she is a professional in
industry she is known in the industry as

2
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,698
a business security leader with a unique
blend of technical and business she's

3
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:28,680
also a BASE jumper and you know what I
work with enforce it information

4
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:35,120
security info security risks is ramping
you actually have more or less the same

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,239
you have i think a chance of another six
to get an accident so you also think

6
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,370
before jumping and I think this is what
our presentation will be about her about

7
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,860
risk in general

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:59,809
think you really short though I can't
really stand by this thing goes home

9
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:07,158
probably move around a bit before we
were Clement I wanna talk to you guys

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,299
about what BASE jumping time about risk
in in how I think it applies to our fill

11
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,259
in information security in either
totally you know two different

12
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,610
discipline there are a lot of
similarities that go on so I wanna I

13
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,909
know and I know that you guys are really
this is really technical audience and

14
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,650
you don't get sick too tons of really
intense technical talks then I'm gonna

15
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,579
tell you right now that this is one of
those will talk in themes and high-level

16
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,059
concepts

17
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,970
we use the question at the end of it and
want to talk about our overall approach

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,990
to risk in general and you know as
people as you go through these talks in

19
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,658
as you present these talks I'm curious
about after seeing my talk what you

20
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:08,009
think of risk and are going to more in
depth about that but i wanna talk about

21
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:16,850
predicting and analyzing and reacting to
risk specifically that was taken last

22
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:23,180
year and Idaho's my favorite place to
base jump because it's legal it's about

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,840
480 feet and about five seconds to
impact that's your reaction time and

24
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,660
that's what we have to make some good
life saving decisions ok so my claimant

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:44,180
gave you know high level but I started
out as a penetration tester a while ago

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,989
and I used to live in Seattle for Levi's
and they did that for about five years

27
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:57,920
and then I got bored of that and I want
to do more than one to really talk to

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,488
people and influence from the top down
from the bottom up and really just get

29
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,780
things done and I got sick of Sarah
reports over the fence I started getting

30
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,930
two more security management program
management specifically applications

31
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:24,340
offer security now I took the summer off
to base jump in skydive and

32
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,360
I now work in industry little bit in the
sky diving industry a similar

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,319
commercials and do stuff on camera and
when I which is kind of fun sites doing

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,429
security but I've just accepted an offer
now head of security for financial firm

35
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:49,510
based out of Chicago Los Angeles and are
excited about that

36
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:55,730
embracing risk when I hope to to bring
to you guys in this talk is really to

37
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:00,250
tell you you know a little bit about
BASE jumping and why it's risky

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,769
obviously we know that the risk there's
a risk of death or no loss of life or

39
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:11,370
limb or something really catastrophic
and then compare that to risk and

40
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,639
security how we're dealing with risking
security however suggesting it today how

41
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,860
are reacting to it too and then move
beyond that and apply those basic

42
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,950
principles to security and how this is
the question that I want to leave you

43
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,750
guys with how we should be doing it
differently

44
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:41,680
ok so as a skydiver based on for a thing
about risk very differently because if I

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,240
do something wrong I'd I have you know
five seconds or millisecond to figure

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,910
out what's wrong and fix it or else I'm
gonna lose my life so when I think about

47
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,110
risk I think about it in those kind of
you know life terms and that's that's

48
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,460
really important I think as a kid people
we should be thinking about that we

49
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,060
don't think about that so much I think
about a lot of database record number

50
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:22,830
losses something kind of arbitrary that
can be fixed so I think that you know

51
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:31,200
going to lead security for a company I
it's my job to ensure safety and ensure

52
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,430
risk reduction rate and that's all your
guys jobs to do no matter how

53
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,810
technically you are or how high level
you are at the end of the day that's

54
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,270
your job I'm gonna give you a little bit
of pace 101 you guys know exactly what

55
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,810
I'm talking about

56
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,850
base stands for building in tennis fan
and earth building is of course what you

57
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:04,570
see there on the left that's my buddy
Marco who jumped into he's the guy that

58
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,270
jumped off of the World Trade Center you
guys have heard about that he got a lot

59
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,510
of trouble with them felonies and
whatnot I took that picture that was the

60
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,099
first based on that ever saw in person
and it's really what got me started it

61
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,890
was the coolest thing that I had ever
seen I never one of the biggest jump

62
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:30,419
before I was like holy shit that antenna
is less frequently photographs because

63
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,109
it'll be harder to come by

64
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:42,310
they're not really easily accessible
spin as a bridge obviously that's my

65
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,210
first base jump and I was scared out of
my mind I can barely see over the

66
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,479
reeling and my job is to climb over the
railing and jump off of that my whole

67
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:59,550
body is literally screaming at me to
stop by and earth

68
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,410
what you guys are probably most familiar
with you guys probably may have seen

69
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:12,830
maybe on you know sports channels or CNN
sometimes wingsuit BASE jumping that's

70
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,140
my friend

71
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,240
couple of months ago

72
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,760
BASE jumping in Turkey and that was the
most frequent way people diabetes and

73
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:43,039
that's absolutely dangers out there one
in six people have 160 people died be

74
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,960
something those odds are really bad
thats 100,000 jumps I'm sorry one or two

75
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:59,049
thousand jumps in skydiving one in every
hundred thousand jumps my friends have

76
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,170
died in the past six months

77
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,610
you know security but he's sitting next
to you think they're gonna die and

78
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,830
they're gonna they're gonna die tomorrow
cuz i didnt go do something risky like

79
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:18,000
that's not really the reality of
information security out of about two

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,580
deaths total that's my buddy Josh he he
he was massively told do the huge pure

81
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:39,500
and rocked massive big pink wings like a
boss is about as many as you can get so

82
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,320
now that we understand how risky this is
probably the next question is why the

83
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,860
hell would you do that so like I said I
didn't start out wanting to be nicer to

84
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,120
base jumping because

85
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,760
cuz I thought it looked cool I wanted to
be that cool I started thinking about

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,020
managing risk in managing fear became
like a mental hack to me like how can I

87
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:10,360
individual Indu situation like that
control of my feelings and emotions and

88
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,520
determine if this is a really risky
situation that actually walking into

89
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,360
that was cool to me like mastering and
try to imagine or something that human

90
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,560
beings early do today because everything
is so safe all the time you know you

91
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,670
drive to work you do that you don't know
on the way to work that's how safe you

92
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:42,189
know by the way is driving me way to
look at my brain deconstructed while

93
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,270
having a ton of fun there's huge rewards
BASE jumping like not only do it

94
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,339
adrenaline rush to get total dopamine
injection whenever I jumps all of my

95
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:59,380
senses become heightened bear I can see
better I can hear better everything else

96
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,339
is just like elevated so that's pretty
cool just like security we've got

97
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,950
awesome community like you guys do
really special interesting stuff you

98
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,830
know 90 percent of the rest of the world
just doesn't get things is really cool

99
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:22,190
and you around that so much that such a
cool thing they get to share parties you

100
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:33,200
know these servers also have these kind
of things he's a reality check our life

101
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,390
I was next up for so long is that by my
computers and lots of emails verge used

102
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,069
and talked about reasons and stuff but
this kind of shit a different way on me

103
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:54,020
and that was it was really fun for me so
how we assess the risks we have known

104
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,810
risks and the unknown risks rightly
could get this entire list of stuff that

105
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,619
could possibly go wrong

106
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,850
on a frequent basis in the US list of
countermeasures that counter everything

107
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:14,300
all those risks so that kind of one way
we look at known and unknown like shit

108
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,910
happens you know stuff sitting around
all the time so you have to have a

109
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,650
mental ability to do that the most
important part of risk management for

110
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:31,480
base jumpers mental having the ability
to realize when you shouldn't do

111
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,050
something or when you should do
something or when you should not put

112
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,300
your ego into it when you should back
down big deal

113
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,920
skill level right like knowing when you
should do a basic operation because it's

114
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,459
too hard for you there's a lot of really
technical BASE jumps out there not just

115
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,160
putting on a pair of shoes running off a
cliff like really really bad looking at

116
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,810
the weather we're looking at things
called goes so goes

117
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:06,739
imagine stream going by me here and
there's just kind of a weird ripple on

118
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,450
it

119
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,510
doctor and missus my parachute so I
don't want to jump off and put myself in

120
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:30,930
a risky situation under canopy of the
only real sports or things you can

121
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,800
partake in that as you get for your risk
of death

122
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,560
increases if that makes sense so people
dying or not the new these people are

123
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,910
dying or the guys that are flying
through the cracks in their wing suit

124
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,689
about this high from the ground doing

125
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,800
hundred and twenty miles an hour and
that's because they've gotten to a point

126
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,160
where all of their safety precautions
are dialed right they're willing to take

127
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,790
an extra risk because they know how to
save them self but a lot of times it's

128
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,150
way too much risk to take on and there's
a real problem where these people are

129
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:15,670
dropping like flies so the base industry
as a whole needs to understand you know

130
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,589
when they should just back off base
jumping is one of the things I love you

131
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,180
guys so there is no point break movie
but they're making a new one and it's

132
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,949
coming out on Christmas Day wingsuit
BASE jumping in it and I can guarantee

133
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,330
you had massive influx of young kids
that wanna go to town that's really

134
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:42,690
terrific so I think the good thing about
this for securities it doesn't suffer

135
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,850
from this problem like we're not we're
not getting debatable I don't think

136
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,520
we're getting a lot worse as we as we
move forward I think we are making a lot

137
00:13:52,520 --> 00:14:01,970
of really good strides actually kills
base jumpers this is in this is what I

138
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,770
think in order of priority or what makes
people go in as we call it

139
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:12,819
number one is ego that is the mental
aspect of it that I told you about this

140
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,280
is when we don't have the wherewithal
within ourselves to create a safe

141
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,380
environment complacency that's when we
we do this so often or nothing happens

142
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,150
in we kind of have this in mind that we
can actually die from this and we can

143
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,050
actually get injured complacency is
really what kills people most of the

144
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,310
time of course now functions in gear
failure it doesn't happen a lot but it

145
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,739
does happen my buddy

146
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,839
should join the other site was doing
based on that he does a lot he's doing

147
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,970
something and his parachute happened to
be wet so as you rotated the pursuit

148
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,970
took half of a second longer to open and
so as it rotated it wrapped him up and

149
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:11,470
down that's what it is like micro risks
that shit happens stuff that that we

150
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:18,390
have to think about a lot the other one
is objects as those are the things that

151
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,800
the base objects are called buildings
antennae spans and earth and also the

152
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:31,649
environment to do that now you have your
baseline online and I hope I didn't

153
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:38,000
scare it is actually really cool why do
I want to talk about this it is security

154
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,080
conference like I said I think they're
really similar hacking very fun sexy and

155
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,149
cool you get dopamine russia's drama as
well you know when you're sitting at

156
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:56,310
your computer nearly this is going to
get that they really did Russia feeling

157
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:04,010
that's the same thing that I'm
experiencing something a little more up

158
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:09,500
there it's a risky and edgy you know
based on being as illegal hacking has

159
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,370
been in can be legal proof aureus you
get the feeling you doing some sneaky

160
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:23,390
shit sometimes I'm sorry from swearing
breaking and entering there's a lot of

161
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,209
that going on

162
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:30,498
on I think a lot of urban explorers the
higher you get when you're on top of a

163
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:40,420
building so aside from the fact that
they're just similar I think about risk

164
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,939
when I'm base jumping I think about risk
when I met where when I'm sitting in

165
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:49,920
meetings of my stakeholders and I'm
trying to explain to them why they all

166
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,910
of these vulnerabilities mean something
to them in a way that has impact on them

167
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:10,289
like I want them to understand that this
risk is real security think this is this

168
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:14,939
is the thing that they constantly
popping up in my mind as I am working in

169
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,799
and I don't know how many times you you
guys in maybe you don't feel this way

170
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:24,168
but I feel like I'm like why are we
paying attention to this problem is this

171
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,409
really the issue is is is this what is
gonna think this company is this is what

172
00:17:28,409 --> 00:17:34,299
could make on my end users you know
commit suicide like that happening that

173
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:41,720
americans love them at some of them did
and I think I think that our analysis of

174
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:51,450
this risk is misaligned in a lot of ways
and obviously there's a massive business

175
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,809
around risk it pays a lot of our bills
and we've created all these products and

176
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,220
all this stuff to kind of outline what
risk is and what it means you guys see

177
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,539
this cyber DEFCON DEFCON cyber thing the
other day like this ridiculous company

178
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,460
and they produce a lot of spreadsheets
and circles and grass in the center of

179
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,289
it says the risks and they have constant
over TMM like you know they've made it

180
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:25,779
something that we should pay attention
to and I look at this and I go I'm even

181
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:28,700
know what that means that that means
nothing to me if I was a

182
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,360
CEO and that was supposed to mean
something to me in terms of what risk is

183
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,990
in my environment I would not know how
to interpret any of that so i are seeing

184
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:47,390
the internet security and software is
just massively new thing it really is

185
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:51,010
still new and we as human beings are
trying to understand how it fits into

186
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,340
you know we're not being a saber tooth
tigers anymore so how do we assess this

187
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:11,090
misc stuff on cyber stuff somehow this
flow chart is the first time going on

188
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,310
but i wanna know what risk means like
there's thing that we can take all these

189
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:20,740
vulnerabilities we can prioritize and we
can do something about them that's great

190
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,400
but what does that mean like what's the
risk what are we actually protecting we

191
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,710
don't even know the question of what we
are protecting is not actually there in

192
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,690
this stuff this is like this is stuff
that we produce frequently we do in more

193
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:40,550
waivers stretches like this out there I
will admit I make tons of this stuff

194
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:47,470
Redbox's guy green boxes it means good
or bad who knows

195
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:54,770
in the purpose of it is to communicate
upwards doers user management our

196
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,000
stakeholders where are we secure re not
secure a place that's the question that

197
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,750
we're asking here but the point is is
there is no one size fits all risk

198
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,800
profile for oliver various companies and
assets rate like there's nothing that we

199
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,860
can plug and play into this risks to us
so here's why i think its a little

200
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:25,209
misaligned teeth at Texas really bad the
top one says the season Rajendra right

201
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:33,360
so the risk and where we're at and we're
supposed to be coming down from the sea

202
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,760
so I think right like he's the one
that's telling us

203
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,830
us from various sources how good were
doing and I found that and I think that

204
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:52,000
I'ma leader in security too so I am
responsible for this as well but I think

205
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,540
that there's an agenda going on in the
sea so sweet they want certain things

206
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,879
funded and they want to get their bonus
and of course like the dinner make the

207
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,820
company look at when they can so they
make it up to the border were doing

208
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,710
pretty good I've definitely seen things
like red team Pinterest miscommunicated

209
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,440
up and that scared me a lot because the
communication was well you know they

210
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,080
didn't reaches that much we caught it
but the truth was that we found out that

211
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,840
we were like an M&M structure we had a
lot of some sort of hard outside and we

212
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,649
were still told the reachable we just
didn't have enough time you know so that

213
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,860
kind of stuff scares me a little bit
create the false sense of security

214
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:47,629
the false sense of accurate risk
compliance compliant complains creates a

215
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,450
false sense of understanding of where to

216
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,460
because for many reasons I don't know
how you feel about complaints I hate

217
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,840
doing I think everybody but every system
outside of the compliance world doesn't

218
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,740
get looked at because people are too
busy focusing on August compliance stuff

219
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,020
right now everybody doesn't like doing
it and on top of a don't know how often

220
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,370
we've said we're doing it but we're not
really doing it we just have bought

221
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,830
something and put it in place and have
not configured it but we're doing file

222
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:29,120
integrity monitoring share things with
these tests to write likely path good or

223
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,310
a No

224
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,770
because we excluded a shit ton of IP
addresses

225
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:42,560
a nurse can range so they were
communicating that out to bait you know

226
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,820
that in our quarterly reports so we're
getting all these like we're clean we

227
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:53,740
tax stuff but it's not actually true
major breaches I think it's something

228
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,110
where risk is a line like if you'll go
the breaches in the past years so

229
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:08,740
Madison grinder OPM all that stuff I I
can guarantee you that these companies

230
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,420
are thinking about the information
security programs at the cases companies

231
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,230
ended up Africa breach was not something
that was ever outlined in their security

232
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,760
plans even something remotely I mean I
don't know you tell me if Ashley Madison

233
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,540
really thought that you know their
consumers are going to be you know

234
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:35,470
actively harmed and even that order
order fallout that was happening with

235
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,870
that stuff like the the families you
know families getting upset all this

236
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,159
stuff which you can argue is not the
company's responsibility but in some

237
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,160
ways it is because if they're actually
trying to protect their users which they

238
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:56,080
should as a company and they should be
thinking about that stuff as well acted

239
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,340
definitions obviously we don't no
problem in security that we don't know

240
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,870
what all of our assets are that's fine
but it's difficult to really understand

241
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,149
our environment when we don't include
people reputation of individuals in our

242
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,240
in our a successive occasions which we
should we should also be thinking about

243
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,930
life not just about every single
technology peers resource saturation or

244
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:30,300
either paying too much attention to or
not enough attention to certain pieces I

245
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,830
seem bridges where entire I T teams are
literally everybody's hands on which

246
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,689
when you think about it is great right
it's great to get everybody's attention

247
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,900
and eyes on this doesn't fix the problem
but at the same time everything else is

248
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,690
being left to the wayside business

249
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,929
isn't functioning as it should because
it's stuck on security stuff like this

250
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:56,629
in response to heart bleed and it was
cool how fast we got stuff taken care of

251
00:24:56,629 --> 00:25:00,389
and fix the same time it was like yeah
there's a whole bunch of other security

252
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:03,059
issues that we need to pay attention to
you as well

253
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:06,690
was hardly the thing that we should have
been paying attention to that is not

254
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,179
what got them at the pony award for the
most hyped book I mean yeah it's a

255
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:17,730
problem but there's lots of other
problems to either think reliving

256
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,269
Twitter define what what we should be
focusing on a lot of times it's like

257
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:27,309
someone says something on Twitter that
it gets put in a blog and then that's a

258
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:31,500
huge deal and then we have to go fix
this problem and we don't really know if

259
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,360
that's really impacting our environment
that much but but we gotta pay attention

260
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:47,340
to it by watching you should watch it
one of my favorite quotes from Episode

261
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,120
seven or eight but she says

262
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,320
solving the worlds problems one
spreadsheet time and he says hate you

263
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,539
theres just like any other government
right

264
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:08,629
casein stuff like this this is like PwC
or something like that and it outlines

265
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:14,879
of risky stuff we need to answer
questions for and its habitat would have

266
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:23,178
risked stuff and after filling up his
messes spreadsheets followed by days and

267
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:28,769
days and days of interviews not just me
but with everybody else and I T

268
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:37,860
department so I see a bunch of stuff
process

269
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:47,040
tools how teams are laid out how are we
doing her ensuring you know software

270
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,450
security network security incident
response and so forth which is great as

271
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:56,780
well the cornerstones of information
security but I don't see is that it

272
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,090
doesn't handle anything outside of that
and it's debatable whether information

273
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:06,820
security should but it will be
considered rate this is where I think

274
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,020
there is continuous off we got those
fluctuating assets and definitions we

275
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,410
don't know what should be protected and
what is protected what we should be

276
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,900
paying attention to the business cares
about painting attention to it all so

277
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,780
it's it's not easy to keep a list of
stuff right

278
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,490
deciding what's important is that the
CTO the end users IT security is it the

279
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:40,929
PCI Council is it something else so
asset definitions exist for basic

280
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:46,090
technology but nothing outside of that
we've got socks and HIPAA compliance but

281
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:52,360
now it's impacting someone's life I
really think that information security

282
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:58,379
is not just eighty problem or did a
problem reaching like that it's really a

283
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:06,950
business and a life outside of just
security outside of programs I think

284
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:12,500
that the risks don't align with actual
threats like this thing that I have a

285
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,850
problem grasping when when people like
if you do it keyword search on your

286
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,149
Twitter feed and look for the word risks
or anything like that you see people

287
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,830
just throwing the word out like crazy
there's a risk this risk is a risk but I

288
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,030
don't really know what the actual threat
is no correlation between risk and

289
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,610
threat doesn't make much sense like I
get the designer billion of risky but

290
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:39,040
why and base jumping for every risk that
I have I have a threat that I know about

291
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,490
I know I know exactly what's gonna kill
me time and it's easy for me to make a

292
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:54,380
decision on what I should do with that
risk

293
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:02,950
so that whining and moaning here's what
I think we should be doing a little bit

294
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:09,590
differently as technology is getting
more personal obviously we're huge into

295
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,360
the social area we've got Griner tender
and Facebook and everything like that

296
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,139
that's really impacting in people are
living their lives on these platforms we

297
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,700
need to start reevaluating that risk
continued home making sure they were

298
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:29,290
putting that life part social part into
her into our risked stuff and not just

299
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:38,370
black and white technology abilities
beyond that and and I think that we

300
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,360
should be embracing risk right like risk
is cool we wouldn't be here if we don't

301
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,290
like risk I wouldn't be surprised if it
was a risk you'll be really boring stuff

302
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:54,730
if you were you know in some way you're
getting caught right or or breaking

303
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:02,460
something because you can so you
remember this graph from BASE jumping

304
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,500
and I said what actually gets be super
skilled and i think is really similar to

305
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:16,210
what actually gets a breach ego culture
priority these are coming down from RCC

306
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:21,680
coming down from our boards is coming
down from our c-level executives they're

307
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,270
the ones that set the prior to what we
should be paying attention to that

308
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:33,230
agenda allows times can and cannot get
us reached or can be a big difference in

309
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:43,000
how we react to stuff I was involved in
a very large breach while ago and the

310
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,140
sea soyuz

311
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,240
as an excuse to cry wolf whenever he
could remember that breach like you do

312
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,770
you think this is gonna pay attention to
this you know which that's it that's his

313
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,970
call he can do that but you know if you
do it all the time like that you really

314
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,440
just get no attention whatsoever

315
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:08,500
complacency to placing complacency means
like we're getting so user environment

316
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,080
that we lose our justified paranoia and
a lot of weight I like I it's fearful me

317
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,230
to say it like security people are not
perish but I think in a lot of ways we

318
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,590
can be about a lot of stuff in the in
this is manifesting itself in like that

319
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:27,110
I T teams making security take a back
seat like they know they really don't

320
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,419
think security is a priority in a lot of
ways and that's definitely due to

321
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,230
complacency in base jumping we have
something called target fixation and

322
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,450
that is when we pay attention so much
does something that we actually make it

323
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:46,540
happen and i wanna talk manifesting as
it's not really that but for example a

324
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,800
buddy of mine debase you know being here
is fine everything open find his flying

325
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,560
his peers you and he flew directly into
a flag poles were like why did you do

326
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,230
that what happened to you and you
couldn't stop staring at it and that's

327
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:04,500
what happens you know we do that
insecurity is well its priests you boo

328
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:22,200
but we do it happening this is where the
brute actually comes from and also

329
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,960
objects in the environment

330
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:32,350
somethings misconfigured or whatever but
my my point here that you know that

331
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,110
killed long before they ever do the base
you know we get fruit wave of florida is

332
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:43,219
actually eat and these are the reasons
why in the risk continue as I see it now

333
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,680
exists on the left or right we will talk
about technology information we talk

334
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,940
about operational duplicated that

335
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,360
and then when I think we should be
paying attention to him on the right

336
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,919
hazard an event stuff you know how to
deal with anonymous threatening the NFL

337
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,240
and how do we secure that I couldn't
read before that we never thought about

338
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,600
physical security and how it exists for
the networking stuff that was not

339
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,889
something that we consider it all

340
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:24,380
market economic stuff and also likes
reputation systemic risk reduction for

341
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,880
every single risk that I have a piece of
gear that does something to counter

342
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,310
engineering is the first key to systemic
risk reduction and you guys know that

343
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,889
you know that building software see the
first place is the best way to keep you

344
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:46,650
may change over time and our execution
is as well like I need I would never

345
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,000
jump off a cliff if I didn't know that
here was gonna work the way I wanted to

346
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,090
work and then I have to do it the way
it's supposed to be done I have to jump

347
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,389
off the cliff and not message that but
we came here I have to actually go out

348
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:05,570
we need to do this over the place offers
well in immigration and countermeasures

349
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:11,790
ray like we go out with a stutter risks
that we don't list out how to fix them

350
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,330
kind of do but not really that we don't
align them with the actual threats I

351
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:28,120
really think that was associated drivers
to go with it

352
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:40,819
I love it he said don't jailbreak
because of some risk we should see

353
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,400
cooler risk let's work to reduce that
risk and be free to jailbreak there's

354
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,840
lots of talk about self defending
software these days which i think is

355
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,820
pretty cool in my skydiving really I
have physically assault defending device

356
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,620
that if for some reason I get knocked
out or just certain speed and altitude

357
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,770
then I reserve parachute deploys and
save my life it's pretty cool if we

358
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,130
could have stuff like that

359
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,620
security as well as I think
self-sustaining software is defined as

360
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,370
something like suffered patching itself
and in the event of a threat or risk

361
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:24,049
something like that I think risk reads a
lot of innovation right like we've got a

362
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,260
lot of stuff has come out of our
security field helping bring security to

363
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,580
help bring suffered some more robust
place and that's really cool we should

364
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,190
use it as a instead of trying to
eliminate immediately use it as it used

365
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:47,220
to innovate and build up something else
around it so be risk taker and access to

366
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:56,520
take the risk and then be ok with it

367
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,560
is critical and base jumping in and
that's my mentor on the left he totaled

368
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,299
his reaction time I've talked about
reaction time in basically every

369
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,080
microsecond counts leak something goes
wrong you literally your parachute opens

370
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,819
toward long way from the law you have
about second to get away from that while

371
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:24,090
literally I see in security especially
in in response teams them having a

372
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,130
really difficult time communicating and
understand the environment and trying to

373
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:33,360
figure out what's going wrong at any
given time and that's largely due to a

374
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:39,460
lack of coordination with you know
Technical Operations teams or understand

375
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:46,750
the asset and immigration classification
and it also has a lot of stonewalling

376
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,840
from my teeth using this part they don't
actually want you to know what's going

377
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,240
on with their environments are terrified
that you tell them to do something about

378
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:31,939
it

379
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:52,360
things in it and so then tracked leaders
threat against the massive massive

380
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:58,700
effort and it's just a lot of a lot of
brain power to defend that mean do you

381
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,339
have any hard and fast rules or it's a
big problem that has no solution

382
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,740
honestly like list of all abilities mean
absolutely nothing to me as a business

383
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,819
leader they mean alot to me as a
security person but as someone who is

384
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:18,850
like trying to secure environment I
don't want to let you know there's gotta

385
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:22,850
be some insight into it and some context
around it right and i think thats where

386
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:30,040
understanding what it is that we care
about matters but given examples I am a

387
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,910
suit jacket but that's what I basically
do end my customers have no idea what

388
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:42,140
their asses but I can get a list of all
abilities you say should they discard

389
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,650
that or should they take some action to
that mean none of the people I work with

390
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:53,530
have any for example I mean isn't the
list of laundered billions and what the

391
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:59,910
assets are and what they mean shouldn't
that be the end it shouldn't be like it

392
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,270
shouldn't be vulnerable is associated
with the server it should be

393
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,600
here's all these vulnerabilities with
this server that does is really

394
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:13,540
important thing that we should be caring
about something they never see the light

395
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:20,259
of day who cares do you have any hard
and fast rules that you were suggesting

396
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:29,140
a lot of good stuff in there there's a
takeaway point and I answer that

397
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,640
question

398
00:39:32,640 --> 00:40:01,379
it's kind of a question i mean in a way
it's hard to answer

399
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,510
I don't know I mean I don't like the
traditional threat modeling and whatnot

400
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,190
which is cool and it was that good stuff
I don't know if used Microsoft modeling

401
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:15,810
tool for sure but I don't know if I
would paint that picture using that tool

402
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:22,960
for you know board for example like
something I never thought about was when

403
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,330
I was working for a news big media
company that had a news arm was

404
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:36,090
protecting sources I thought ok I'm
looking for an entertainment company I

405
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,860
don't need to care about lesions dates
but I never thought that it was a

406
00:40:39,860 --> 00:41:07,920
friendly actually diet you know we
started creating use cases around that

407
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,660
what are your thoughts on transitioning
from a technical role to a leadership

408
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:19,609
role and what mine was like mine came
out of necessity in fear I was working

409
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:24,980
for the time in 2005 which is super
small consulting firm about 10 people or

410
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,970
something and everybody was really
disorganized and communications to

411
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:36,470
customers were terrible and I reports
look bad and so there is really need for

412
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:41,169
somebody to come and start managing that
stuff so I started managing all the

413
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,589
engagement that we're going in and out
of the company at that time that taught

414
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:49,750
me how to marriage people you know
security people that were you know

415
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,630
didn't want to get up for meetings and
whatnot and I liked it you know i i like

416
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:01,790
I was like a love the technology side of
things to like i misspent testing but I

417
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,700
feel like you know the total measurement
dork standing up here in front of you

418
