1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
right hi everyone I like to welcome
richard has a beautiful beautiful saying

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,849
about hiking and it states that it is a
practice that must be understood with

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,820
humility explored with persistence and
mastered with grace and a flair for

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,840
style and I think that that's laid the
basis for the topic you going to talk

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,060
about he will suggest his insights based
on his experience he had hearings during

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,580
its alright Richards it's all good to go

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:38,329
ok good to go good morning i mean good
news did you hear be alright by raising

8
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:44,510
a hand if you can hear me all right very
good wonders of modern technology it's

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,039
early in the morning here and a cup cup
of coffee and a few pills and you're

10
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,210
good to go thank you very much for
allowing me to come to you this way I'm

11
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,270
sorry that I had to have a tooth
extracted new ordered me not to fly so I

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,000
have to come to you this this in this
fashion I'm going to be talking about

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,510
hacking in this century I caught trance
planetary not only because it's a nice

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,270
cachet but because our life in this
century will as you put up we suspect by

15
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,189
the end of the century certainly be
transported Terry we will not be limited

16
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,589
to this planet we may not be limited

17
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,009
almost certainly will not be limited to
this solar system and the

18
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:38,890
transformational power that is afoot in
our eyes right now how can best be like

19
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:46,930
you too real hacking real hacking came
out of the nineteen sixties at MIT and

20
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:52,140
it didn't apply only at first to
computer technology and applied to any

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:00,159
ingenious more creative or humorous or
innovative or exciting way to take

22
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,450
something that already existed and
transform it into something a radically

23
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:11,660
new so hacking is a radical state of
mind really an app which looks at what's

24
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,690
been built

25
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,160
and has been built to a purpose but sees
other possibilities and ends or purposes

26
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,609
in that thing hacking universe itself to
practice it must be understood with

27
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,520
humility and explored with persistence
and mastered with grace and a flair for

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,170
styled weirdest begin it it begins with
the concept is above beginners eyes

29
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,059
which look at what is before us with no
preconceptions in order simply to see

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,620
clearly what is there and look in such a
way that we can distinguish between

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,400
what's in our own minds what we bring to
the encounter to our apparatus of

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,910
perception itself and what's quote out
there that boundary where those meet

33
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,980
where we both have create half perceive
the reality in which we live

34
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,070
that's the gray area where hacking takes
place you could liken it to the brackish

35
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:16,200
tied waters where life begins its where
new things stirred to life and if you

36
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,810
look at the innovation that is taking
place today

37
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,530
of the simple fact is no one can master
what is happening today even in their

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,760
own domain I talked to see when I can
some of the very best people in the

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,260
world

40
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,160
insecurity and in the intelligence
community and what they know is that

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,709
they can't know everything no matter how
much they do

42
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:46,250
be caused the platform of innovation
already has been built which enables all

43
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:53,400
other discipline its to move at the same
speed with I T in hacking has begun to

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,860
move so in a way to the future of the
21st century is already there it's a

45
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:07,130
mold or a footprint of possibility into
its the future losses like rain or mud

46
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:14,060
into a footprint and those who allow
themselves to be next to the future that

47
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,570
already exists of a future that's
already there they may look like

48
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,550
geniuses but they're really just hackers

49
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,560
looking at the way the present and the
future which are constructions of

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,650
reality in our own minds intersect so
it's that same concept again stepping

51
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,060
back from what you think is the future
and having the courage and willingness

52
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,440
to see that the future is on one hand
already there and on the other subject

53
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,990
to your own creativity so it does not
really exist from one point of view or

54
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,620
if it does it doesn't exist in the way
we think it it does it's a possibility

55
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:58,520
kind of like when something is the
possibility actuated army real only when

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:09,639
you instantiated studies serious studies
have detected its future events what we

57
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,530
preach that condition at a rate greater
than chance and that's that's just the

58
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,270
future really is already there but held
in suspension and available and that the

59
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,710
one you choose is the one that will
manifest itself is stepping up at edge

60
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,198
between present and the future

61
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,500
know once in awhile i uses a futurist
and this is a joke I know I didn't even

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,169
know if the alarm clock would I don't
know the future but we try to get our

63
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:50,599
minds around the present and interrogate
the multidisciplinary information that

64
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:55,360
is coming to us and when we integrate
that success and assimilate it can

65
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,440
articulate what was found to people like
the future especially if they have in

66
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,300
the past so the possibilities for
hacking in the way that I'm talking

67
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:12,029
about really constitute a reality and
then the other people in the world the

68
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:20,060
ninety do not live on its creative edge
given that reality in the picture for

69
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,490
which occurs build the frame by frame or
the ground and peeing

70
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:30,960
are the unseen unnoticed assumptions
which build the possibilities reception

71
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,940
which are now lets you create in the
moment that people in

72
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,850
engage with them reality remembers dicks
said great writer paranoid schizophrenic

73
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,800
but for our time he said the reality is
that which would no longer believe in it

74
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,930
uses to go away so that zone of hacking
the necklace the past but dissipates the

75
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:01,290
future lies on the edge its social
constructions of reality that share you

76
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:09,600
can live inside their real sheep but if
you refuse to believe in your beliefs

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:16,690
and hold them lightly like an agnostic
you can remain open to possibility so

78
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:24,420
the city for mastering in the way of
describing it not sure if it is mandated

79
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,290
by the untimely stories that hackers
must then by making and doing it created

80
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,250
which are contrary to its realities of
our times in other words if you're

81
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,900
living in this intersection of of future
and present you are living where the

82
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,469
consensus realities in which people
leave uncritically are being manipulated

83
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:54,000
and managed and they are on time because
to create new narratives to create new

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,930
possibilities something as simple as
Facebook or oculus rift virtual-reality

85
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,180
coming I I have a son who works at
oculus rest and when he is a

86
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:14,140
demonstration of what is right this is
going to be as big as Facebook and we

87
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,950
are going to live in a shared virtual
space once the apparatus becomes easily

88
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:24,760
assimilated a wearable and see each
other as advertised that are as real as

89
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,810
what I am seeing on the screen now I
take for granted that what I am looking

90
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,890
at that

91
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:38,030
bodies the people in this room are real
for all I know this is a creation by a

92
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:45,390
special effects department in Ghent and
that i'm looking it's all mostly male

93
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,199
mostly Caucasian avatar is that

94
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,440
created for my benefit to convince me
that I'm talking to real well the

95
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,190
manifestation of you as images
assimilated by me if you are real is

96
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:07,000
just a foretaste of what is coming in
the virtual realities in which we live

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,540
which means actors who predicted that
space will create the reality in which

98
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:20,140
people actually believe they live now we
cannot overemphasize the depths of this

99
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,170
transformation years ago

100
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,849
computer scientist named langdon winter
said to invest in new technology

101
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,990
requires the Society also invent

102
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,920
ie you will use it all

103
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:43,349
order practices all relationship all of
our ways of defining our identities will

104
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,590
fall by the wayside Newport new
relationships and new identities take

105
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:54,100
those of you who have lived like an old
person like self has lived through this

106
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,160
transformation period understand this in
a visceral way you are born after it

107
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,490
takes place

108
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,670
accept it as simply so in case after
case that

109
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,860
to digitize instead many pre-existing

110
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,940
warms it said they gon liquid ice cube
in your hand that turns into water using

111
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:23,530
their shape it's their retailer
expression in other words the nation

112
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,089
that we're going through its identity
shift and hackers are an emerging as a

113
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:36,380
result of the analogies of information
and communication have been built so

114
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,710
what are the sources here identity
identity is defined by a boundary a

115
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:51,210
boundary around and organizational
structure or an individual used in

116
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:57,490
states you more

117
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,260
America was founded by the edges of our

118
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:09,220
and this out there constructed realities
is defined in our boundaries are

119
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,720
expected

120
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:21,420
constructed and innovation so what is
your destiny is your identity identity

121
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:35,569
is the title of it it's called phone see
that post behind me the whole universe

122
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:45,110
wonderful and awestruck a that's the
protagonist of Rome and he came in his

123
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:53,800
inform that identity was destiny who you
think you are how you define yourself is

124
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,229
in fact who you are but the bodies have
been radically changing let me give you

125
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,960
an example you in Europe know this

126
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:07,580
there used to be what we call Europe
Europe is not europe used to be

127
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,260
nation states are not what they used
we're headed nation states come from in

128
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,470
the first place

129
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:21,000
our way of organizing a political social
and economic reality appropriate to the

130
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,050
flow of information into and out of the
complex systems in which we lived with

131
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,510
which we were refused because we are
cells are complex systems of information

132
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,050
and energy that are defined by how we
perceive ourselves in relationship to

133
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,750
the largest systems are structures that
we build and that identity is exactly

134
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,520
what's it flux let me give you an
example of how about how that looks

135
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:56,230
I was doing so it's not too long ago for
the FBI and you don't the FBI 23

136
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:05,210
organization to do turn only in the
United States the CIA and stood up in

137
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:14,020
1947 was initially stood up and it's in
situ intelligence out of the United

138
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,710
States

139
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:22,530
but it was discovered that you could not
do the one without doing the other and I

140
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:30,670
explained this the FBI special agent in
charge of the year

141
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:38,860
what we counter said we we used to be
able to go to eric and identity and

142
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:45,300
invite the cooperate with patriotic
basis and and they they generally would

143
00:13:45,300 --> 00:14:07,790
increasingly we are I would like to do
that but but you see how they have yer

144
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:19,959
has changed so while they would like to
americans can't power its behavior now

145
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,690
come from Japan's national entities that
transcend the four used to call nation

146
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:35,980
states from within the United States
Open operates with it

147
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:43,310
States for example in a complicated
terror activities with the new york

148
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:49,640
place because they're more fearful of
attacks in an almost anywhere else

149
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:56,220
the FBI and the other end originally but
as I said it in that it's now has

150
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:03,180
offices all over the world in other
words of necessity and structures that

151
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:10,030
injures that have come down trees go
altered the eight candidates what

152
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,510
example in the book

153
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:20,420
government experts caves

154
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:28,050
government they worked for which they
live so she and John

155
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:41,540
Nick good for government those entity or
to do actually a Google if you work for

156
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:48,790
think if work for whoever you're real
behavior by the sources the power and

157
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,019
influence inside the organizational
structure and those are in many cases

158
00:15:53,019 --> 00:16:02,660
placing a power that nation is to
believe they had ok so is one of the

159
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:12,230
major implications this is the visual
changing let me put this is for me for

160
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:18,149
thirty in the morning and evening this
philosophical is not trivial bear with

161
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:24,700
me here and individual is a concern in
the reality that emerged after the

162
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,370
Reformation several hundred years ago
and I want to make the point that I

163
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:39,579
think of his generals did not exist or
their time here for example 815 hundreds

164
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:46,120
and early sixteen hundred's he only was
beginning to visualise in our modern

165
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:54,190
sense of being distinct or special
because it meant that time it meant

166
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:02,370
inseparable you look through all the
Elizabethan era contemporaneous with and

167
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,099
searched in vain for that touch on
anything that looks like our

168
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,918
contemporary notions of social
development or psychological development

169
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,780
the way in individual moves the word
adolescence was a French term for a

170
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,069
period of life that literally not exist

171
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:26,480
defined it was defined by the social
changes in economic changes that enabled

172
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,160
it to become an emergent property of
society when we had to begin to prepare

173
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,390
people for it now I for one period of
apprenticeship as opposed again by for

174
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,450
example by Shakespeare's Romeo who was

175
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,220
thirteen years old getting married 12
and 13 because they were ready for it

176
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:57,539
had called adulthood they were simply
human beings is that that is now being

177
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:08,779
hacked fundamental ways by technology is
that urges drop and so is what has been

178
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:16,330
happening literature and music and all
of the things that you think of ethnic

179
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,678
boundaries around them in the same
individual they don't any longer

180
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:30,440
get all the music really all the books
for little or no cost

181
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,840
ocean of intellectual property did not
exist

182
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,320
the invention of the created a new
reality which was a text that seemed

183
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,510
objective and separate from an external
to the individual who created it

184
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,730
the notion of an officer we think of it
like the notion of itself did not exist

185
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,510
so the premodern concept was totally
different

186
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:07,549
what is the point is that the flow of
information and in and around the system

187
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:21,320
and i ended in a bad play wonderful
technologists said insecurity weakest

188
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:29,320
link in the security and is the
definition of the problem is not in the

189
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,418
same way again the weakest link

190
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:45,889
of possible and our identity a rich what
that we're so one route that hours now

191
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:51,309
exercised very differently this is why
hackers and in the sixties seventies in

192
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:54,770
the eighties in earnest young fans too

193
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,210
and and could participate in this
powerful way power is exercised

194
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,480
different or web and our identities
become nodes in that at work

195
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,110
the individuals as defined individuality

196
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,120
urged few hundred years ago a new form
of identity which we are poor and I T

197
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:25,780
cells in saudi and cannot function other
then in a network part because now

198
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:32,010
everything that needs to be known at the
collective Caen lab story but no then

199
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:41,730
and so functional where hackers are
those who built it what you need to know

200
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,730
in need to do

201
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,560
originally hackers coming online in the
eighties

202
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:56,560
their university computer because they
couldn't afford or hackers clerk says

203
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,899
power participating in a meritocracy
they learned that power would function

204
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:11,770
of contributing information online and
asked for help and it was when you're

205
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:20,500
done everything you could do on your own
staying up late trying it in the system

206
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,260
is best you could and it went to the
best minds in C you would be welcomed in

207
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,420
learning partner and a functional
partner because you showed you had done

208
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,040
the work that was necessary to
participate in a meaningful way but our

209
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,540
leadership in that marriage is no longer
dominating a controlling dominating

210
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,200
controlling is still very afoot in our
world but participating and contributing

211
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,630
is how you learn to function in the
network online it was a fundamental

212
00:21:53,630 --> 00:22:01,980
shift in the definition of the
individual self so it is shipped I have

213
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,050
a friend

214
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,210
whitewater kayak and he said he learned
and he looked

215
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:19,340
racks look to see all went where water
goes wide is that insist saying the what

216
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:27,050
and in the way that i've been talking
about it means new and urgent properties

217
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:33,540
giving them a name that's what we do
that's what creates it is seeing

218
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:40,610
emergent property prior to any OC even a
few minutes or a few hours giving them a

219
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:50,600
name it considered a creative where in
the world that I'm distracting where

220
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:58,449
things are changing parts of the idea as
they are

221
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:10,770
edges edges of our participation in the
world it's under as if you think about

222
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:17,230
it which you live it and it's nice that
one too far ahead was considered

223
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,490
ridiculous John Galvin when it was a
great company

224
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:30,710
test where the great came from that made
the huge leaps for time and he thought

225
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:40,480
about it he said they always begin their
life or in other words that's just

226
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,570
reality of something else

227
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:51,530
articulated narrative as I call it that
was contrary to what they believe that

228
00:23:51,530 --> 00:24:01,270
sounded ridiculous and they laughed at
it make seriously into orkut in which

229
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:08,490
but if the person that's the idea
forward it then five then the Jets would

230
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:16,090
attack it rejected try to suppress it
would even assassinated continued to say

231
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,379
it until they brought it forward so much

232
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:27,680
finally became the core of a new
consensus so with and insanity

233
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:36,460
architects in other words they are you
in a pair of a new radical idea based on

234
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:51,490
the card if people inside the dr betty
those notion it will and it's like and

235
00:24:51,490 --> 00:25:04,300
yeltsin else is there to this day it
said and they had to discuss a new way

236
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,870
of

237
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:15,510
and everyone immediately agree on how do
it is wrong said if immediately agrees

238
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:23,020
that it's the right way to do so they
were always wrong that speak as if the

239
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:31,500
new idea was to what they already are
still it as reality they would always

240
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:40,240
behave according to the paradigm it they
had been socialized and that was on chip

241
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,720
yeah tease which was demerged property
changes that were taking place so

242
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:56,640
important thing here is that is shifting
constantly and will they as a result of

243
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,880
its effects constantly mind in chain and
that's why I couldn't George but are all

244
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:13,400
great truth begins as last all great
trips begins as blast actor openness to

245
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:21,010
heresy heresy in their lives in ship to
what people around

246
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:28,570
Steve find ludicrous to suggest so
sometime

247
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:35,990
giving talks like this I don't want to
do that because the mere fact

248
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:50,299
enough to cause I could have sentenced
and anxiety they cannot tolerate is back

249
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:58,408
into their consistent with greater
tenacity see instances of this around

250
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:07,429
you but the refugees into europe now the
emergent properties or way which will

251
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:15,750
not go away just because we do not want
to be not long ago I was a doctor or

252
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:25,840
other night museum in and it was called
it was for curators artists are

253
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,019
rethinking

254
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:36,639
Europe had been changed young man and I
did that Spain and England twenties you

255
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:44,549
always showed up at a national
boundaries seemed real and I suppose now

256
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:47,908
out the dots on a map

257
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:55,679
something transparent it was a very
different world Europe is if World

258
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:09,000
Editor earth is it so what are you see
him and it was open way see lining in

259
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,559
seeing a present

260
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:21,529
Europe which definition account I faced
with it

261
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:35,740
invent at the upper weight described as
in Europe as this is a key and in Alice

262
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,040
in Wonderland caterpillar assets are you
so

263
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,860
request that brought you as a is not
where do you want to go to a

264
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:55,459
said but because of the i/o it the
biosphere

265
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:07,520
set up my talk at DEFCON is now the
front is technology see the markers of

266
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:20,160
how biology of urge as built on the same
example markers at this at midnight

267
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:31,530
MIT PhD PhD in biology 2004 MIT
president at his background was in

268
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:40,200
biology and not an engineer because
biology is technology and is that

269
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,320
frontier of which you would leave
fundamental

270
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:56,750
speak and when it's available if you
look at the stanchions of of the rain

271
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:03,510
and we are all in on perception I we are
related

272
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:15,590
ourselves to our it in some way it's
that last raised or trees which were

273
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:24,360
used ecology signing create the kind we
want to be this is where hackers

274
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:33,669
day and hacking by up or by acting is
now available in computer hacking became

275
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:41,210
available in the eighties when jobs and
Wozniak bill the Apple to time ago they

276
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:53,840
made available a cheap eats more people
use that enabled them power in there

277
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,250
the hands of anyone who wanted to use it
for $1000 you to know you can buy

278
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:11,370
everything you eat real genetic and to
participate which we are doing and have

279
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,689
been for many years you always like its
community and the military capacity

280
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:24,860
development is forecasting the future in
which society itself will give twenty

281
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:31,289
years takes 10 or 20 or even thirty
years he's heard from inside the

282
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:37,190
security worlds for research and
development is dark out under different

283
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:49,779
than what they have been going to
develop at the middle when I say they

284
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:59,159
have entities that literally scared that
work with his age

285
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,740
bio is their bio is their biggest fear
and so they have been working to counter

286
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:13,529
this message in our own pathogens this
is a different world and technology and

287
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:28,600
the air and which therefore it nor did
in the eighties and nineties you could

288
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:38,629
or should I was going to do what
happened to it is what I mean by that I

289
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:44,970
mean it's become so ever so that's that
everyone's life no longer sick of it

290
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:55,529
quote it was only two years in prison
now when you take out your are taught

291
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:05,909
you don't say I'm going in to YouTube
side but you do have the highest

292
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:16,419
holding a way that they don't mean when
you come into the room that you say I am

293
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:24,990
power grid you don't see the power grid
or and yet if so on 18th century 20th

294
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:31,669
century the first hour everywhere in the
landscape but we make them disappear

295
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:37,830
into the background of our lives and
just assume that we will quote lights in

296
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,720
my lifetime

297
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:47,370
my mother saying to me I'm making a long
distance call the notion of making a

298
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:56,699
long distance now I'm thinkable so it
has disappeared in the same mariposa

299
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:03,320
implants and means of altering our
apparatus exception

300
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:12,310
a way these glasses I see through them
but I don't see them I see through them

301
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:20,060
and I regret that I have sometimes but
look wearing because they have

302
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:28,129
disappeared very since I am I recently
but my age had cataract surgery

303
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:38,909
spent a bit of surgery and it still
plans with a plan and I was good to have

304
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:44,419
that done in both eyes I see very
differently and coast which i'm looking

305
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:49,529
I can see now perfectly with the new
eyes that have been engineered to

306
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,730
replace the eyes that I had that is an
example or metaphor for what we are

307
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,250
doing to our relationship to all of the
various technologies of information but

308
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:07,210
a biology and that is why I knew who is
emerging in this century now I'm going

309
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:18,730
to get kind of crazy and it creates a
chance for century I'm going to show you

310
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,330
creation in creating a historic

311
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:39,350
I'm just gonna save about ever been to
the us- cover two UFOs ending in the

312
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,910
nineteen for the government did because
they were dealing with a phenomenon that

313
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:51,930
they knew was Rio which according to the
testimony could observe stations and

314
00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:02,100
underground lake and just explain this
book BC is a pretty thick book 600 pages

315
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:10,339
nearly 1,000 and what makes it stand out
above us worked names of the people I

316
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:26,990
need some where the names of who over
the years in a crime that we are now in

317
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:34,339
five University Library University of
bed but it's in major universities

318
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,590
around the world

319
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:44,160
the doc taste footnotes in the primary
data from government so in other words

320
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,210
today that in the book

321
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:54,960
karadzic knowing how nineteen eighties
the government chose back by using cover

322
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,270
and deception operations and little
report of unidentified flying in order

323
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:10,530
to study and research subjects and at
the same time down to sidle or created

324
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:16,290
new technology that they could not
master control to understand or do you

325
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,690
really understand it to this day

326
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:25,630
government responded it is not about to
explode

327
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:32,079
but my point is that it does not
undertake to end its reality in such a

328
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:41,829
fundamental way it to act like ourselves
in this field for 35 years with the very

329
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:48,039
best source to reach hackers to put
together the pieces that we can get no

330
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:56,900
matter how partial a construction of at
least gives us a size and the shape of

331
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:06,009
the new reality UFOs have been seen as a
reality that like gal said hear about

332
00:38:06,009 --> 00:38:12,839
them and then if people insist on it you
ruin your career I let's tell me they

333
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:17,990
never to mention it because it would
destroy their careers when Deeks

334
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:26,279
state reported above Minnesota when he
was a test pilot the response from nasa

335
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:29,680
was just one of our players astronauts

336
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:37,879
message was clear bleary-eyed astronauts
who see the modus operandi of coverage

337
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,839
deception are three things creating
illusions creating this situation and

338
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,578
distracting bites out of hand and
ridicule the greatest of the ridicule is

339
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:58,430
used so effectively the authoritative
voice actors but I actors insist

340
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,529
struck during a practice realities of
what they see

341
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:10,269
beginners eyes of them whether it's
biology transplanted to rely on the fact

342
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:16,890
that life exists all over and that we
are not to pop this is an untimely

343
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,140
narrative aggressively

344
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:28,890
accepted or no we are not alone in the
universe nature of art is known for her

345
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:38,990
way only to a few so as need used it to
bill is on top story on time out

346
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:49,180
our time and effort at future we are in
such as receiving and FB aiding I only

347
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:57,160
means one in 10 leave to go beyond his
presence on my way of understanding

348
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,589
reality at sense

349
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:06,730
artists actors to work it acknowledges
that just are all on time

350
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:14,460
new possibilities for what is to come
they mediate translate

351
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,590
is exposed

352
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:24,000
leaves are what we hold now as good
enough out of there are functioning in

353
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,550
the world as we understand it and its
intelligence professionals know when you

354
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,950
put it

355
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:35,810
share the fundamental building blocks
your plate on alternate reality in order

356
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:44,080
to be that way when the hackers or just
normal normal users what they are doing

357
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,750
a step down there in order to speak with
in that knowledge or reality or

358
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,359
vocabulary the people to whom they're
speaking and if they can't do that

359
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,340
sounds like magic sounds areas are all
guys you guys are such great geeks I

360
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:03,690
don't know what you're saying but if you
really want to commute 8 you have to

361
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:08,850
step down in the back to step back you
falsified you change it into something

362
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:14,279
that is understandable terms of the
prior paradigm weekend and you know that

363
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,450
it doesn't do does realities with which
you work so signing new realities for

364
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:32,549
artists and protecting is always in time
it's possible ways of living and what

365
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:44,570
happened to it but as I said they cling
to what they are and more tightly they

366
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:51,310
come up with explanation of families
sound

367
00:41:51,310 --> 00:42:02,890
because it's already believe want to see
or what is coming under many guises

368
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:11,839
fundamental beliefs of this is true and
it's it's easy way to see it let me

369
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:20,750
define how I came to see once upon a
time I worked with the established

370
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:27,430
church and I had a perception early on
in the eighties the technology was going

371
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:31,919
to transform religions in a fundamental
way it was gonna change the

372
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,360
organizational structure to change the
realities of power and and it was going

373
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,910
to change the very symbols that people
use to buy to the tribe religious

374
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:53,220
practitioners its primitive difficult to
unravel we don't look at how technology

375
00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:03,759
has created registries it's just very
briefly I'm is raining down you first

376
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,300
religions were oral oral culture and
when writing emerged as a revolutionary

377
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,910
change that eliminated oral culture

378
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,290
dated oral wreckage it's either the
religious leaves translated it could be

379
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:29,090
written it disappeared once writing took
place the founders of religions who you

380
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:37,940
want but it is super etcetera they were
all real or transmit it they became

381
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:44,900
written entities with which people
through the text it so simultaneously

382
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,540
two things were happening one was that
the human consciousness

383
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,860
identity to which you referred was being
transformed

384
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:03,190
consciousness and at the same time that
they were

385
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:11,829
eating and internalizing detectives
began to 30 aidid to this report

386
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:22,119
externally in the world in the text the
printing press and I bet reality with

387
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:28,470
you have the Reformation part of the
world we caught Protestant church urge

388
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,060
it was a function of ecology the word
the printing and I try to communicate

389
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:41,109
stands for 200 years it has done that
anyone who is willing to become patches

390
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:51,578
that simple reality that I eliminated
their leaves in the same night or early

391
00:44:51,579 --> 00:45:02,619
way they did a function of the
technology is it defined there there are

392
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:17,490
they were create fundamental reality
that so i can text you can't exchange

393
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:32,020
their content and as I said new trip
emerged from the edge that is because in

394
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:42,250
a way that future doesn't even exist in
the same way that it did just get better

395
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:57,099
future to really is that we share our
world it would say is the horizon I see

396
00:45:57,099 --> 00:46:06,250
this as it encounters the malleable of
the universe and holds it as we watch

397
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:16,710
for the last time one master all known
therefore message

398
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:23,300
keys today as a result of the eighty
revolution that no individual master of

399
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:30,380
the material of the knowledge in their
own domain and this is very good reason

400
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:40,349
as it is already in their own domain
faster anyone can get their minds 2010

401
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:50,770
every every year and no one person know
even in their fees so in a way we can

402
00:46:50,770 --> 00:47:01,460
say president of expertise in the
present in there and in other people's

403
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:12,400
demands and the S so all of us are
living in the degree you said we define

404
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:24,880
its current state RT did a signing the
but you're also define and so the future

405
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:33,560
is it really is this just a word trick
its present it in a relationship of what

406
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:41,950
are the urgent knowledge is known thing
no max he's in big cities are creating

407
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:58,660
so what does happen to all the structure
of our are you gonna go for a new pair

408
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:11,098
charity said as one task it always
sanctions break are hitting similar

409
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:19,220
activities but simple foreign and
domestic no longer hope the convergence

410
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,450
technologies of attrition interception
stream reach

411
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:29,839
sense of urgency of the counterterrorism
and 84

412
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:37,279
leaders did you have to feed some anime
orifice and state defined by behaviour

413
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:45,579
entries borders or even a clear idea
about this is created a set since it

414
00:48:45,579 --> 00:48:48,319
undermined its cornerstones

415
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:56,269
previous religious traditions I said
long geez make speaking interception

416
00:48:56,269 --> 00:49:02,950
obsolete our current technology aptitude
to fiscal framework and them into may in

417
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:13,218
its effort to go get it built in one
moment it's sounds like a declaration

418
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:29,380
should I and why did turn instead of
just not I was working at NSA mostly in

419
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:35,279
a day at a park in conversations on how
to relate to world which was created

420
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:36,779
after 911

421
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:41,210
secular voters came from the white house
to the agencies and instructed them to

422
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,950
do things that previously had always
thought were illegal and

423
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:49,308
unconstitutional that was a real
breakthrough been forced air

424
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:54,690
practitioners collagens because it
violated what they had internalized is

425
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:58,920
doable and right and possible but it was
mandated

426
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:05,369
technologies interception in order to
fight this amorphous entity I had

427
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:10,269
written the story in which a dying
intelligence practitioner made a lot of

428
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:17,180
statements this is what we do he said
and he listed a lot of things that I I

429
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:22,410
cobbled together from my understanding
and conversations that were true after

430
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:28,319
snowed one made a photograph that page
into tweeted it connects it to links to

431
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,788
Snowdon showed that I could say and
fiction but Snowden was saying in

432
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:37,059
reality now there's a huge difference he
was saying it with authoritative voice

433
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:40,670
and documenting it I was asserting it in
a short story

434
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:45,690
a friend and an essay called me last
night he said 95% of your story is true

435
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:51,690
but you have to know which 95% in my
experience was that people misunderstood

436
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:58,319
which 95% it was the reason I can say it
in fiction

437
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:07,740
only was that a bit of any prosecution
for violating laws but also reflected a

438
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:12,058
new kind of hyper reality in which we
have to live in which the truths of our

439
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:17,930
lives can be articulated only through
fictional means because to articulate

440
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:23,790
them clearly in forthrightly means as it
did note that you have to live in russia

441
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,690
and unhappy small apartment in instead
of traveling the world enjoying your

442
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:36,220
life what security practitioners doing
let me conclude security practitioners

443
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:44,459
is transforming the world and the dire
possibilities of this societal

444
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:51,869
disintegrate and re-integration elevates
the moral responsibility to a higher

445
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:58,559
level you are ultimately responsible for
it in social and global order at a level

446
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,780
of understanding far beyond that
formulated the past by any single nation

447
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:08,190
you are part of a global community in
the aggregate of practitioners and

448
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:16,010
Sharon deficit mode is vibration normal
citizens and you therefore have created

449
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:24,130
an intrinsic calling you really maintain
global order in a way somehow consistent

450
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:29,339
with an armistice be refashioned them
invited these new technologies the real

451
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:35,640
definition of the intelligence community
as it is as it operates is to prevent

452
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:41,609
chaos in the world and there is a
movement of information through their

453
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:50,020
community norms of state public we do as
a nation states in order to prevent

454
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:54,040
chaos from completely breaking out in
the world

455
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:59,870
looks chaotic is a kind of orderliness
implicate order to the chaos is

456
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:05,520
currently taking place because the
redefinition of boundaries around all of

457
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,580
our identity identities from individual
to organization all the way up to

458
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:14,200
geopolitical identities nation states
and even the planetary definition of

459
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,660
ourselves that we have assumed as a
species would be in violet and now we

460
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:25,600
know is not want to simply by saying
this is your calling is your vocation

461
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:34,640
hacking is the practice activities which
redefined the world and take seriously

462
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:41,759
plate that city of them in moving out of
the models which are obsolete and

463
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:51,050
archaic nearly a century or a week in
order to understand what is because

464
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,210
those who have more granular
understanding of what the what you are

465
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:00,720
creating a practitioners of security and
intelligence have a higher moral

466
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,709
obligation to assist humanity in make
the same asset which you buy

467
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:12,320
of your hacking mentality your your
willingness to look into things to

468
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:18,580
boldly go where if not for other people
lacked that a bill and our task is to

469
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:26,299
assist in making that trip minimum of
dislocation in a world in which this

470
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,290
