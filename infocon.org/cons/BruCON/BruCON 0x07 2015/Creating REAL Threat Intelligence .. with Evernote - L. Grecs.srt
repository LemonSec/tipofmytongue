1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
1 I'd like to introduce Greg city-states
he's going to discuss an experiment he

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,980
did how to use Evernote an informational
threats intelligent management platform

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,810
so what's the word up for a great look
right testing is this on anybody hear me

4
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,820
right

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:35,300
yeah so this is just a little experiment
that I did been working on it for about

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,239
a year now but basically trying to you
you some of the stuff that I learned at

7
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:47,980
work but try to use it for my own
purposes at home so first my typical

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:58,519
disclaimer so I have about 20 years in
the industry about sixteen of those have

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,620
been focused specifically in information
security in the past five years I've

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,630
been more in an operational environment
in a say in a security operation center

11
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,810
either helping them move to the next
level or or or at least did initially

12
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,820
working as an an analyst in so I in in
his part of that I also do the training

13
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,210
currently with instant response but as
you can see I you know done a lot of

14
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,240
security engineering stuff if you're
from the USS there's there's

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,280
which is a government compliance worked
proposals did trade studies you know all

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,159
the way up to what are you doing now so
I've done a lot so the things that I

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,600
want to focus on tuesday was just a
background of why why why I did this why

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,780
am I trying to use Evernote to generate
threat intelligence right so kind of the

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,479
contributing factors to that is a little
bit of dash boarding the secret weapon

20
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,169
does anybody here know what I'm talking
about when I say the secret weapon

21
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:14,708
ok that's good so we'll learn a little
bit about that and then also silos of

22
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:21,890
threat excellence so you know really
just taking a quick look at what threat

23
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:31,109
Intel is and is an emerging those three
things into using Evernote so to manage

24
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,330
all that data so that you can generate
threat intelligence to help you defend

25
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,850
your network in the example that I'm
going to be using its more of a focus on

26
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,400
you know you run a website so it's
fairly simple simple be an obvious

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,350
obviously you're gonna have scaling
issues with Evernote once you reach a

28
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,799
certain size but in one of the things
that i'm gonna talk about is that the

29
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,140
lessons learned the lessons that you
learn you trying to create something

30
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,700
through Evernote you can you know use
either open source or commercial

31
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:17,630
solutions to be able to scale that so
the background at least in the sector

32
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,590
that I work we have a huge tendency to
over complicate things we will take a

33
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:30,040
simple idea and we will try to build it
and they will go through like a whole

34
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,560
system development life cycle to build
this idea so you start out with

35
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,049
requirements and then from that you go
to go through the whole development

36
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:46,989
process in finally delivering it usually
in the end what's created isn't what

37
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,700
helps me it doesn't help the people that
we built this solution or the product

38
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,619
for in primarily that's because it's
built on requirements that were

39
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,459
developed like the year year and a half
back so whenever the solution finally

40
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,290
gets out there there there re-
quirements essentially have changed so

41
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,010
obviously we've

42
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,139
least some of the smaller groups have
transition to doing more than a job

43
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,420
development process but I'm more of you
know keep it simple stupid

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,160
so the whole kiss prynne printable don't
try to over complicate things you know

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,450
try to use the tools that you already
have in in in different ways so that you

46
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,729
can meet those specific needs to the
example that I give is is is there was a

47
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,160
workflow system that someone was
building for hiring new people what

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,660
happen you know they develop the
requirements for it to build this whole

49
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,380
thing

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,430
year and a half later you know i i went
back to the manager III had since left

51
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,850
but he went back to the manager and I
asked them you know how that hiring

52
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,700
workflow system going in in she said
that basically they know is using it you

53
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,860
know because they built this whole
system and it wasn't usable by the time

54
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:20,710
the system was built another principle
in kind of related to that is no build

55
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:31,000
at least try to before you buy in or you
n then bye bye that could be also

56
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,960
setting up a hope for a whole
development project as well use the

57
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,890
resources that you have in-house you
know the quick and dirty so illusions

58
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,620
because a lot of times you already have
the tools in in the capabilities in the

59
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:54,630
resources available but if you just
using in a slightly different way maybe

60
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:01,390
maybe focus more on Tues may not have
the exact capability that you want but

61
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:08,210
maybe set up processes to help control
that people use the tools in the right

62
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,849
way in the whole thing here is that
usually if you do a quick and dirty

63
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,770
solution it it's going to be maybe sixty
percent of what you need and that's

64
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,760
something that you can use now and the
best part of this is at the end of that

65
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,190
period

66
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,090
you understand what you really need so
whenever you build it first you

67
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,140
determine what is true

68
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:37,890
requirements are maybe that eventual
solution that quick and dirty solution

69
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:44,210
will meet your needs and you're happy
with that if it doesn't at least you

70
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,520
know what you really need so that you
can partner with with commercial

71
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,650
entities to look at solutions that are
out there or maybe develop a a whole

72
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:03,460
entire or bring in a whole development
team to to build like a fully lifecycle

73
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:09,780
solution I think the emphasis here and
in this is something that Dave Kennedy

74
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,059
mentioned in the keynote this morning
all

75
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,330
was to focus on the people I i
augmenting that somewhere you focus on

76
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,390
the people and end the process first to
determine what you really need because

77
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,000
you may not need that expenses solution
using the resources you already have

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,380
that may be good enough that quick and
dirty solution but if it doesn't then

79
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:45,990
you can go to building an entire product
worse alternative solution or partnering

80
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,850
with some of the different software
solutions that are out there but at

81
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,810
least you'll know what your gaps are
into you can pick the product that did

82
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,960
feel that fills those specific niches

83
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,010
the keys in in point was threatened tell
services and if anybody saw Chris

84
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,450
Nicholas instruct yesterday morning

85
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,200
you know one of the points that he
emphasized was was among a bunch of

86
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:23,000
other sayings was to you know bring your
threat Intel services in-house a nominee

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,700
explain why here so getting back to the
problem that I was trying to solve this

88
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,189
I was working as an analyst I was
looking to take advantage of this open

89
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,300
source in

90
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,240
Intel but it was very difficult because
I would have to go to like 10 sites and

91
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,610
search on this ip mean you could google
it and you could get some of that stuff

92
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:53,060
stuff back but what I was really looking
for was you know a repository of where

93
00:08:53,060 --> 00:09:01,430
all that information is so that I can
searched in trended over over time said

94
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,229
the restrictions that I had this was
just sort of a solo projects so I wanted

95
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,279
to take all this open-source Intel and I
wanted to put it in a bucket and it had

96
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,170
to be you know the organization wasn't
gonna supply this for me BB because that

97
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,500
would be like a year-long process just
by like a server and set it up with

98
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,950
something so that organization wasn't
gonna provide it for me in in in like

99
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,810
obviously there would be no option to
build something internally so I wanted

100
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,369
to build my own obviously hosted
externally but I wanted something that I

101
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:44,100
could access from the inside so their
specific requirements I was looking for

102
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:50,209
was just a big bucket of that I could
just dump all this data into so things

103
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:56,880
like blog feeds or other type seeds data
driven feed so if you think of like the

104
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,000
shadows servers feeds that push out
indicators or Nikes on a regular basis

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,240
data files so these are those black list
that are out there so that you can you

106
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,670
know the black list of sites that you
shouldn't go to war

107
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,829
blacklisted IP zora domains than
anything else you know maybe I'm you

108
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:25,370
know some vendor put out a great threat
Intel report on on the next apt right

109
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,220
well you know I want to grab that and
just thrown into the system to you and

110
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,920
having everything into this one system
where I can do one certainly can find

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,199
everything out about that

112
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,340
so obviously I wanted it to be
searchable I wanted to have a way to

113
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,850
categorize things and I think one of the
most important things is I wanted a

114
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:54,620
tagging capability which serves as an
alternative to table of contents or

115
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,170
categorical as you so that you can view
data in different ways basically

116
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:06,959
creating higher keys of tags for what
you want to see anyone is something that

117
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,940
was cloud may speak because I'm lazy in
I didn't want to have to Lake speed up

118
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:18,010
the server and patches in nineteen it in
one thing to point out here because I've

119
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:23,300
given this presentation one other time
in in i think im I'm looking at this

120
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,250
from an analyst pointed years so I
worked pops up and then I want to go to

121
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,800
my threat until my open source thing and
I want to search for me that I P or that

122
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,459
string so I can find stuff out about it
which which is different from taking a

123
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,720
bunch of these threat Intel feeds in
Denver merging them through sticks and

124
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,830
taxi and stuff like that and
automatically deploying them to your

125
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,020
ideas

126
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,720
IPS is our firewalls so he was more
focused on in getting back to a Dave

127
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,170
said this morning it was more focused on
helping the people do their job so just

128
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:12,329
a little bit of background the dashboard
and stuff so this is basically we're

129
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:18,350
kinda wanted the seeds that started this
project up I was a sign of security

130
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,000
engineer several years back and I was
assigned to develop a dashboard for

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,310
executives so the method that it did I
use was I just use risk in in in in in

132
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,920
in the two components was vulnerability
and threat until I basically created

133
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,439
like a few tabs on this dashboard so
there is like an overall tab there's a

134
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,329
vulnerability tab and in there in there
was a

135
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:51,559
tap into I came up with some generic
data sources so that you know the

136
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,670
executives could get a feel for hey
what's going on out there on the

137
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:03,488
internet so there were some you know
other sources that are used there so

138
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:08,959
it's no secret but then we we also had
internal tools which I can't talk about

139
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:09,979
here

140
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:18,040
deadwood scan and give us data Lake and
Lake Lake what what patch level we were

141
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,149
at so combined that are two gether just
to create a nice dashboard but the one

142
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,939
thing that I learned from that are some
great resources these in in in this was

143
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:34,469
about five six years ago so so whenever
I left that job I really liked being

144
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,389
able to keep up to date so when I lest I
was able to create something better

145
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,069
because I was recently started using
SharePoint

146
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:53,259
so I basically took all those seeds that
I learned about and I use Google Reader

147
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:59,919
rest in peace and I with Google Reader
you could group seeds in then those

148
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:06,369
groups you could build gadgets which
would show up on your iGoogle page so

149
00:14:06,369 --> 00:14:10,829
it's sort of look like that but
unfortunately he know Google Reader went

150
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:11,628
away

151
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:18,860
few months later I Google went away so I
get in there were a lot of other

152
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,649
solutions that we're trying to fill that
need so I went to feed liane so I kinda

153
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:28,669
used used that and that was nice but it
didn't give me that dashboard that I was

154
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:29,499
looking for

155
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:36,559
so the eventual solution that I'm
currently using today is Netvibes in in

156
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,379
their the paid version in a free version
and of course I'm using three version

157
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,689
I'm so I basically took a lot of those
lessons learned and added the feeds to

158
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:52,110
kind of create this cyber Intel
dashboard but one of the things that I

159
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,130
learned about dashboards was that

160
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,880
they're nice for you know blog post
feeds so if somebody comes out with it

161
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,490
with an awesome blog post and you try to
keep up with stuff so is or if its

162
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,900
vulnerability database that year's
subscribe to there is a lot of you know

163
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,750
just as long as there is a few postings
per day or a few items that appear in

164
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,700
ninety feet it generally works nice and
you can go and check your dashboard and

165
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,020
you can stay up to date with what's
going on but the data driven seeds to

166
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:32,180
these are the fields where you just get
tons of IP's coming out or I peas or

167
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,089
beans or whatever

168
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:39,120
in Qatar you want to use those are
changing too fast so it wasn't really

169
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,660
that useful in into it dawned on me like
why need something to store all that

170
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:51,439
information into I can later do analysis
on it if I wanted to now feedly in in

171
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,570
Netvibes both have a solution that you
can pay for that helps you you can come

172
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:05,100
to use them as a bucket service to check
that out but in the other thing is it

173
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,170
didn't work for periodically a plea
updated data files so if you're thinking

174
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,990
some some of those blacklist that it is
a single text file that you downloaded

175
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:20,070
on a regular basis Outen work well on
storing that deed but like I said one of

176
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,360
the you know the takeaways here is that
I identified many great resources of

177
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,630
information to collect ok so the secret
weapon so does everybody know getting

178
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:39,740
things done his duty does anybody use
out so its task management trust me it

179
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:48,140
it it's you know just in advance to do
there's a whole methodology behind it so

180
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,580
the secret weapon is essentially using
Evernote

181
00:16:51,580 --> 00:17:00,820
to implement getting things done but the
key takeaways that I got from

182
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,310
experimenting with this and I never
really thought about it because if you

183
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,250
use Evernote you just think if I go to
see increased notebooks I can put notes

184
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,560
there Bubba Bubba but if you step back
and take a look at it

185
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:17,179
think I've ever known as a database you
know where a notebook is a table and in

186
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:24,160
note is a free-form record essentially
so following the GTD method they

187
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,590
basically they have the nope they have a
specific you know getting things done

188
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:38,850
notebook sort of segmented lawsuits that
it didn't you can nest notebooks so

189
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,550
there are you GTG stuff would disappear
in one part and not interfere with the

190
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:48,030
rest of them in a really use this
hierarchical tagging so they really when

191
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,920
who what when where and you could define
things Lake you know what would be

192
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,860
specific projects when would be the
importance from you know hey I have to

193
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:03,729
do this now for daily to stuff I have to
do now to stuff I have to do you know

194
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,390
maybe next week and then where do you
get home where you can also who that

195
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,120
task really relates to men what you can
do is you can create searches in you can

196
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,899
save the is so that you can look for hey
give me all the stuff I have to do today

197
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,820
at work and then that would just pop up
kinda into this is way this is from

198
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:31,970
their website into this is there you
know what when where who said they have

199
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:38,980
their methodology methodologies little
different but daily now next for sure

200
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,450
when and where then who it really late
still in then what are your projects so

201
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,140
when do the things with GTD is it's more
of just a framework and you can

202
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,220
customize it to you what what your needs
are so you know this is my method where

203
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,639
I you know I used 04 dealey

204
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:03,449
you know 14 stuff I gotta focus on now
to next etc and then I usually have a

205
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,649
separation of there's like community
things that I do things like you come to

206
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:12,728
Brookline there's stuff they do for work
and obviously and then there's a

207
00:19:12,729 --> 00:19:19,619
personal stuff hey I gotta mow the grass
right in then we're so there's a similar

208
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:25,158
grouping there in then who focuses on if
if that task is something that I have to

209
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:31,700
partner with someone else on in I was
talking about how you could create

210
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,309
shortcuts in this is what my shortcut so
I don't have to like a fine wine and

211
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:42,609
find out what am I do what I have to do
today at home like I don't necessarily

212
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:48,708
have to build this complex worry I can
easily create this query once and I can

213
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:53,450
say save it so I can be Lake I can
select this and it'll show me all the

214
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,440
stuff that I have to do right now at
work

215
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:08,989
a centrist who once you set it up it's
free easy to use to you this is the

216
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:16,019
third part is the the the the third
input that led to using Evernote as a

217
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:23,759
threat intelligent management system so
over the past few years obviously we we

218
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:30,729
all know that threaten Intel market has
been growing so I started investigating

219
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:38,279
you know what is threat Intel and so
i've seen a little bit of it remained

220
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,929
open source perspectives and and I
worked with some of the defenders to see

221
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:48,450
what data they provide but I talked to
experts in in other folks just to get

222
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,339
their perspectives as well and my basic
takeaways are is that it's a very

223
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:59,840
interesting area where you're taking a
single piece of data

224
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,678
and you're doing a lot of math medical
transforms in all this fancy stuff rate

225
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,700
in just you know it's very interesting
but the but the big question is you know

226
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,210
how much value is it you know in in one
of my friends he basically I don't know

227
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,110
if I should say his name but if he
defined as he ever tweeted it then I can

228
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:29,678
just lists his street there but what he
basically said was that if during

229
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,450
intermission soon security and you
follow the rate people on Twitter that

230
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,940
you know there's really not much value
add for commercial then come commercial

231
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:53,130
threat Intel services now that's his
spurs purse perspective so I

232
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,880
investigation of what threat Intel was a
guy was trying to figure out why is it

233
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,760
not useful to us so is everyone familiar
with this sort of seen this the Pyramid

234
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,679
of teen by David Bianco so he basically
said you know these are all your

235
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,049
different indicators types in in
obviously like hash values I P domain

236
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,830
names now network and host artifacts

237
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,639
those are fairly easy to get you know
but are they like high are they

238
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:33,320
high-value medium value whatever so what
I really came to the conclusion is that

239
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,960
you know what Intel vendors are selling
isn't threat Intel its its threat data

240
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,320
in you know in in there is a good
article that probably put together a few

241
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,830
years back called an introduction to
savor intelligence but he references

242
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,928
some us' government document where they
talked about this is the Intel

243
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:03,620
intelligence lifecycle see you would do
this planning indirection collection

244
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,570
processing and exploitation acceptor

245
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:09,850
eg etc theoretically you take all this
day

246
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:14,309
data would suck it in and go through
this whole process and in need maybe

247
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:19,710
you'd get this this trickle of real
threat intelligence which maps to

248
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:34,970
traditional adversary TTP is so how is
this relevant anybody just a little

249
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,730
analogy

250
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:43,820
so I this circle represents a bottle of
the scope of the body of threat data /

251
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:54,820
Intel whatever you want to call a this
is your organization so maybe there's a

252
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,590
smidgen of overlap there so you're
buying this massive amount of data but

253
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,590
most of it is irrelevant

254
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,600
most of it is setting off your ideas

255
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,500
answers your IPS is your firewalls your
proxies for stuff that isn't even

256
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,220
relevant to you

257
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,799
ideally you would want something like
this right you you want him in a bye

258
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:28,150
this threat Intel in in its going to be
mostly relevant to us into this is where

259
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,730
Chris nigger since yesterday morning was
that you know when you're dealing with

260
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:41,470
threat Intel it's definitely to take it
in-house first so just quickly defining

261
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:47,720
what threat Intel is over the different
buckets so we just have open source

262
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,620
Intel think we all know what that is so
there is information sharing so its data

263
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:59,219
is your your join mailing lists or
bulletin boards or whatever and you can

264
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,710
share in meeting their blog collection
is huge so you know most people are

265
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,590
familiar with the log are you being able
to have this data available so that you

266
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,760
can search retro actively having a sim
of some some sort to both you make sense

267
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,158
of that lagdi as well as pulling all
your

268
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:27,489
alerts and be able to correlate them
together for stuff CFD investigate then

269
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:31,080
lastly you know something that people
don't focus too much on his case

270
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,668
tracking you know coming up with a case
management system so that you can have a

271
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:40,210
history of all the cases that you've
worked on in city you can go back and

272
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:50,239
look through that so this is where ever
know finally comes in so I basically you

273
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:57,429
know came in a look at the experiences
that I did dash boarding I mean look at

274
00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:02,499
what I learned from implementing the
secret weapon thing right then i'ma take

275
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:08,159
what I learned about three intel and I
just want to push that all in in in use

276
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:15,149
Evernote as as my threat intelligence
management system to you can define

277
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:23,428
notebooks and hire key tags you can this
is perfect is it open and flexible rate

278
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:28,109
too if you want to change it almost
anybody can just go and change it you

279
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:33,668
could have the manager in team that you
don't have a you don't need a whole team

280
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:42,259
to manage your remedy solution and it's
easy to use over the heavy database /

281
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:46,859
workflow management systems and it's
really simple you just like take all the

282
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:51,320
stuff that you have any set up some
automation and you start dumping stuff

283
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,710
into it like you don't really really
don't don't care the most important

284
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,359
thing is to the dump it into one place
so that as an analyst I can go in search

285
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:12,580
it later so it's just where I focused
most of my time was on trying to pull in

286
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:20,580
open source Intel so just in archive
that in organization could search so

287
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,110
like I said earlier earlier

288
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,610
alert pops you get something off at like
an IP domain whatever you can search

289
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:34,678
through this repository that you have
the benefits is you know you can search

290
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,710
this and you can pivot around and you
can also do in adhesion so although

291
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,520
maybe these notes got created
automatically you can really going in

292
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,139
right stuff like oh this is this is not
a good entry door this you kind of have

293
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:57,160
a history and you can document what your
whole the value of that particular in

294
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:03,860
indicator so you can do you can dump get
your day

295
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,409
data in through fields in a little bit
of automation and the other thing too is

296
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,230
if you come across some some the cool on
the web I can just there's browser

297
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,130
plug-ins or I can just click that and
ban because Austin I ever knew

298
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:24,830
threat Intel database and then lastly
you need a recommended tagging structure

299
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:31,720
so I don't want to go to like you're
taking structure to be to pursue

300
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,290
scripted but just kind of the framework
essentially too far to follow and that's

301
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:44,299
what the secret weapon gave me so from
OS from an OS in person perspective

302
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,679
these these are some of the things that
I started out so I'm still using that

303
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:53,630
same trying to evaluate what my risk is
through you know having certain threats

304
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,309
seeds invulnerability feeds and also see
situational awareness feeds so these

305
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:05,799
could be just you know this particular
threat precede or the ISE blog or or

306
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,639
just like a new site related to security
so this you find something and it

307
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,070
happened like two months back you can
actually go back and say well what was

308
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,439
in a news wise what was going on around
that time so we can give you better

309
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,380
context so this is essentially what it
look look like

310
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,380
so I have as you can tell so using the

311
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,830
the hue so these are the sources in then
some of these sources have multiple

312
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:43,520
feeds in in in the fields are
essentially here so but the question is

313
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,730
how do I get all this data into ever
knew so first of all Evernote gives you

314
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,350
an email that you can look like a
randomized thing and so you could sign

315
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:59,040
up for whatever just using that email
although I wouldn't recommend it because

316
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,930
that email service we kept secret to
tell you wouldn't do that I think a

317
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:09,430
better method is used if this then that
great is every familiar with that i mean

318
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:16,610
just awesome tour it's easy to implement
from an RSS perspective you are limited

319
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,240
because usually you know news articles
or whatever you're only gonna get part

320
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,370
of it so you could you know teen tied up
in red a little scraper or there's a

321
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,949
tool in inexpensive tool called five
filter that that I found that you could

322
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,950
set up and it basically turns your
partial feeds into full content feeds

323
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,570
obviously so if then using this with
Twitter so there's a lot of Twitter

324
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,540
bites out there that are connected to
honey pots and you can just watch them

325
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:57,120
tweetIn suck that data in creating a new
note for every tweet and email

326
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,959
immigration especially like in my case I
use Gmail so I basically put a rule

327
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,110
there saying hey if anybody if I get an
email where the subject is this or from

328
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:16,879
this person or whatever you know store
copy of that Internet ever knew there is

329
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,220
a storm stack which is having used it
personally but has been recommended to

330
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,920
me is sort of an open source clone of if
this then that but lastly there's going

331
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:33,110
to have to be some scripts cuz every if
then if this then that only takes you so

332
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:37,209
far so you're gonna maybe have some
scripts especially for

333
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,630
those black list files that I was
talking about there's there doesn't seem

334
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:50,669
to be a good way to bring those in yet
so so for those that haven't had never

335
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:55,210
seen if if this then that but it's
basically you come up with the recipe

336
00:31:55,210 --> 00:32:00,840
title in here I was importing the SSH
brute which is a Twitter guy that

337
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:08,870
Twitter bot that collects brute force
attempts against SSH

338
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:13,370
so I basically say hey a new tweet by
this user in then you can use these

339
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:19,389
reasons reserve tags like username and
text you know put it in the title in the

340
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,740
end the body you can put whatever I say
the notebook that I want to put in and

341
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,390
then these tags in India's little
symbols before the tags and essentially

342
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:35,960
those are that's something that the
secret weapon recommend so you don't

343
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,559
have to use those tags that they're
essentially like preserved like Special

344
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:47,750
Reserve tags and their related to the
who what when where things in this was a

345
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:53,130
little script that I'm on the new
hackers email list if anybody does so I

346
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,080
i live radio in the in the Dec

347
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,330
area in one of the groups there are the
Nova hackers which have been part of for

348
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:06,639
the past several years so I try what I
was trying to do was pull a one it is

349
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,770
black list files in an email to myself
so this is just a simple script that I

350
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:20,830
wrote a mere route a little script as
I'm not have included in like 15 years

351
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,980
but it but then I knew enough or I wind
coming clean it up some in in gaudy to

352
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,659
do what I wanted it so it essentially
goes it goes out there in this case it's

353
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:38,730
looking at for the malware domains in it
checks it has its cease if the house has

354
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:44,179
changed since the previous time that he
downloaded it if it's if it's changed

355
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:46,480
then it sends it often ever knew

356
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,260
and saves the new house if if it hasn't
changed then then it just logged in news

357
00:33:52,260 --> 00:34:00,169
on just just set up with a simple
current script but one of the big things

358
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:06,150
is you know why did the research for a
lot of the focus has been on open source

359
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,139
data in Intel but some other aspects
that I talked about so we talked about

360
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,710
information sharing this could be
something as simple as just shared

361
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,850
notebook so in Evernote I can create a
notebook and I can just share it out

362
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,859
with my partners and then whenever we
come across something interesting we

363
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:29,649
just posted a new note it's just a note
so they you can go in there and had to

364
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:36,730
add comments about it so it's very
simple system so there is logged

365
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:43,780
collection although you know it
definitely wouldn't work on huge huge

366
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,740
enterprise at least for my cases I just
had my web server logs and I'm like Oh

367
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,500
heyy wanna go through a web server logs
and so I basically said all right I'll

368
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,330
go through and I wrote a little script
that disperses out the web server server

369
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:02,000
logs for that particular day and it runs
each night and it sends it off to

370
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,340
Evernote so now I have that log
information available using it as a sim

371
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,910
so not true sim by more last there are
specific things and i'm looking for like

372
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,180
hey are people trying to brute-force log
into my wordpress site where are the has

373
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:25,279
have any files teen star on within the
CMS

374
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,970
director insiders' if you kind of custom
things that I root for that and before I

375
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,879
would get emails about it but it
wouldn't necessarily do anything with it

376
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,820
but what I what I did was I changed it
to push it to a sim notebook so that at

377
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,320
least I had kind of one place where I
could see all the alert and do more

378
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,510
training and then from there I could go
back to my logs rain in in see what was

379
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,829
going on to a nice little quick way to

380
00:35:52,829 --> 00:36:00,140
to do analysis in the other thing is I
guess so there is four inputs that a

381
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,910
focus on but there's also some analysis
aspects of that to you so really case

382
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:11,190
tracking rate so this could just be a
notebook rate its case tracking notebook

383
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,940
and then you could have tags for open
working closed into it and you could

384
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,690
create custom searches for a show me are
the cases the working cases the closer

385
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,029
you know in it and if you don't like
these three categories you just come up

386
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:28,910
with a new one

387
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:34,219
hey there is there is in review rate in
me not something that's fairly easy that

388
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:44,049
anyone could just add so some other
ideas is you could create a notebook for

389
00:36:44,049 --> 00:36:56,209
your indicator database so the true
things that you find that are focused on

390
00:36:56,209 --> 00:37:03,348
me like if you're focusing on advanced
tax rate in in in in in basically from

391
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:07,739
that maybe you could drive like a
campaign database Navy from that you

392
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:13,279
could drive an adversary database
essentially which is a collection of

393
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:17,229
everything associated with a certain
adversary which essentially are the

394
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:23,968
teepees which is that top tier in the
pyramid so how do you find all this so

395
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,890
we talked about it we have tags there is
a basic search so you can go in and just

396
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:35,089
search on certain key words there is
advancers so I can say really go in I

397
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:42,369
can specify certain notebooks tags terms
in that as well as dates and move in

398
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:50,380
most of these searches are by default
they do and Boolean search so example is

399
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:58,430
i search for like I get an alert in my
sim it says hey this my keys turn to log

400
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,890
in in in we locked in now

401
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:06,430
so then maybe I go into my log my a
larger file and I i can look for some

402
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:15,440
some stuff there but in doing this
search maybe I find a note about this IP

403
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,750
from OS into that need maybe from like a
month ago so then I can search like RA

404
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:26,120
that was a month ago between estate in
that date will let me see you know what

405
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,609
it what else was going on during that
time so I can use this search date

406
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:34,930
ranges to go in industry specify those
date ranges and see what new indicators

407
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,339
popped up from the open source
intelligence sources or or just

408
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,110
situational awareness tough news and
stuff that was going on you know did new

409
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,760
vulnerabilities come out

410
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:53,200
exploits come out things like that so
then what this has evolved into

411
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,640
essentially is obviously this isn't
gonna scales her in enterprise but it

412
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,420
was really like what I was talking about
initially we're doing the quick and

413
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,190
dirty first to find out what your needs
are into basically came up in in in I

414
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:15,260
guess these could be your requirements
where you could come up with like it

415
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:23,740
a metadata framework hey these are the
tags that I want to use to using the the

416
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,720
the secret weapon categories of you know
when what when where he and then you

417
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,370
have your different notebooks here and
then you basically come come up with a

418
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:40,870
tagging hierarchy of how you want to use
that in in you can see like define you

419
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:46,380
know when is maybe like priority
confidence word is your data types

420
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:52,170
where's your workflow worse or state and
then lastly it in this is some of the

421
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,430
other ideas that I threw into where
you're talking about doing the same

422
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,509
thing except for you know case tracking
indicator database adversary database

423
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,200
whatever

424
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,368
in one of the things to you is only like
you don't wanna spend a horrendous amana

425
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:12,140
time just like all that automatic data
that is that in like you don't want to

426
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,029
really spend an enormous amount of time
going back in time taking things that's

427
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,910
all you would we do but the whole
philosophy is only target if it's

428
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,399
irrelevant meaning most other cases
you're just gonna do this search and

429
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,920
you'd find stuff that way in the new
thing here is these

430
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,230
announces change you can use like a

431
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:42,290
these this what column here to cross
reference so you could cross reference

432
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:51,440
like an adversary to specific indicators
two cases to open source in Intel you

433
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,829
know maybe you got it from Intel sharing
say maybe it's related to a specific

434
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:03,130
words eg exit row so you can you come up
you know basically search do a search on

435
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:08,010
one tag and come up with everything you
know about that particular person now

436
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:13,010
these last you I haven't I don't have
any need for that but just from what

437
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,190
I've seen people do around industry
that's how you could use it but the

438
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:24,660
thing is you could use this medicine
structure to you know do you like may be

439
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,740
implemented in spunk do help stack that
that that seems like the big thing now

440
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:37,129
you could start this data into seems you
could use wikis meaning you can use

441
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:44,349
WordPress where categories like a
notebook but but in a blog post is is a

442
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:51,950
note you could use SharePoint or or even
something as like just a shared filed

443
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,549
posit Tory with lake with newt died

444
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,660
documents just anything because a lot of
people are doing nothing right in at

445
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,940
least if you can start out doing
something to determine what you need and

446
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,880
you can use that to those statistics and
those trends to

447
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,819
ask for what you need from executive
management but essentially we did we

448
00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:23,538
just need a bucket that can suck in day
Dr supports tagging in allows me to

449
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:30,160
search their it and I got a simple Intel
management system so distant future

450
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,529
ideas that I'm having most of this is
really focused on you know trying to do

451
00:42:35,529 --> 00:42:40,319
more interesting things with some of the
OS in stuff through scripting and stuff

452
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:48,049
to automate it some interesting ideas
are just doing some API automations you

453
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:52,740
could create an app that basically goes
into Evernote and does maybe it looks

454
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,288
for IP's in then it would not attack
those as an example she do cool stuff

455
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:03,230
like that where there's a lot of
third-party apps lake there's a diary

456
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:09,829
operate in the diary app is it basically
uses ever needed as its back in database

457
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:14,160
so you could come up with maybe like a
third party app they would look like

458
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,490
maybe like an incident response to all
but it would just be using every

459
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:27,250
afternoon as the back in so in the
conclusion you know when that one of the

460
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,269
things is you know there's lots of clean
solutions that are out there but one of

461
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,430
the big things I see is that there's no
central place like me to get on that day

462
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:43,129
data into one central place and then you
also need to figure out how to organize

463
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,880
it so really you know starting out with
ever ever known as your quick and dirty

464
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,130
you know maybe it will meet your needs

465
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:59,799
if you're a small group you know like 10
folks maybe that will meet your your

466
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:01,630
needs or maybe you're a huge

467
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:08,279
enter enterprise at least it gives you a
starting point to determine what you can

468
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:14,490
do internally first find where your gaps
are in then thats whenever you go out

469
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:21,500
and maybe try to partner with year
threat intelligence provider so you use

470
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:30,230
that information to fill those gaps in
getting back to that that that example

471
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:36,819
that I gave where they went out and
built this is hiring system in nobody

472
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:40,089
used it so I went back like a year later
and I'm talking to me

473
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:45,480
manager now I'm like hey whats how the
house the hiring system going into

474
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,630
basically said I treated it into this is
like a senior manager per person can

475
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:56,099
make you created it so then she showed
me and she basically just there was a

476
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,519
shared drive

477
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,008
she basically just created a hiring full
folder and had a folder for each one of

478
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:07,920
her workflow steps in as a candidate
would proves he threw she would just

479
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:15,859
move it on so I just want to give a huge
thanks to brew kind of had an awesome

480
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:21,420
time here so thanks for having me guys
you can reach me on twitter

481
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,880
graphics my personal blog is Nova
intersect dot com in there there's a

482
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,799
Twitter for that to you if you wanna
contact me this is that form but if you

483
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:36,630
really want to contact me directly it's
just cracks at Nova InfoSec dot com so

484
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,609
easily upload these slides to the side
chair or whatever and I don't know whose

485
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:48,730
screen scraping those but it but that's
all they don't have any questions

486
00:45:48,730 --> 00:46:05,190
just struck me along the way of course
we started out with quicken the DEA and

487
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:06,620
keeping it simple

488
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:12,980
yeah yeah but this is gonna cost you an
awful lot of time this year looks you've

489
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,710
built an awesome tool set and it's
getting pretty complex yet can you

490
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:24,570
really say it is quick and dirty or
simple anymore I think yeah I mean

491
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:31,460
that's a good good question I mean ed is
a fairly complex system but you know

492
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,250
it's it's really just me doing it where
if you were implementing like a real

493
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,940
solution or if you were to purchase a
product to do this you would be talking

494
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,940
huge amounts of resources so it's all
relative in the nice thing is you know

495
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,340
I've created this for you take it do it
you don't have to recreate the wheel so

496
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,600
you know take my lessons learned in
create your own thing and it does not to

497
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,110
be an Evernote to be in your local Elks
tack in spelunker whatever you know so

498
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:07,710
any other questions and you know

499
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:18,260
their first of all I love the talk when
I was previously working for a well

500
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:25,589
known as inventor I tried to drive a
project almost exactly like this so I

501
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:33,310
like it thinks your data formats like
like your stick stuff I saw as a site

502
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:36,650
yeah yeah how do you integrate those
data points

503
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:42,619
well that's a future that's an area that
I would incorporate having really

504
00:47:42,619 --> 00:47:46,410
investigated that too deep yet

505
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:52,049
like there's tools Lake see if I've
looked at and there's another one

506
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:59,630
blanking on the name right now but it's
for managing indicators but it's what's

507
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,140
there's another tool out there that has
about a hundred open-source Intel feeds

508
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:11,390
in its by the folks that do bro can't
remember the name it but I played around

509
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:16,700
with that i mean that's like you you
could definitely sucked out in in in in

510
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:22,649
in at least conceptually I know I know
that I could suck it in and do that I

511
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:29,260
guess I have to figure out you know is
that can help me because a lot of this

512
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:39,040
the XML structured data as an analyst at
me help me help me it may not use it it

513
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,830
doesn't all that data doesn't give give
me context as an analyst that's

514
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:49,810
investigating in Internet I think this
sticks in the taxi in there is another

515
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:57,180
acronym I think it's great for you know
you have this threat Intel feed-in you

516
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,299
can merge everything together and
automatically put it out to your ideas

517
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:07,800
for your IPS systems the only problem
that I like if I was running the network

518
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,510
I would have an issue with that because
I would like I don't just want to take

519
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:17,280
this deed and is dumped stocks out there
but i guess im looking at it is more

520
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,180
like it we we couldn't incorporate that

521
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:29,430
in there at least it could be done but I
I don't necessarily see a reason for it

522
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:35,379
but like I said it is something that i'm
looking at using the tools like six in

523
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,760
in in a few other other ones that I
mentioned the other thing that you can

524
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,550
incorporate which I didn't even mention
rate so once you go through this whole

525
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,950
process he needs figure out where your
Intel gaps are that's when you bring in

526
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,740
the commercial lenders in in you say hey
these are my gaps can can you fill those

527
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,490
gaps in then you can be using Evernote
but then you can take their threat Intel

528
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:04,009
feeds company into Evernote hours longer
whatever to fill those gaps

529
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:10,430
following question I'm sorry for holding
the mic it seems like you've built a

530
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:17,430
really critical business function around
and ask president yeah yeah you know

531
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:27,910
never know just like guilt would kill a
450 positions last week I see the value

532
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:34,540
proposition but I would feel much better
with an on-trend I agree rate this gets

533
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:40,259
back to the quick and dirty rate hey I'm
gonna figure out what I need you know

534
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,980
develop this whole structure so they're
now when I want to build when it when it

535
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,770
when I go to a certain size that I want
to build my internal system I I already

536
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:53,650
have a framework that i'm gonna build it
from in a can help me choose the raid

537
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:58,760
product that is going to help me because
I know the type of data that I need and

538
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,260
then I'm gonna put into the system but
yeah I totally agree for huge enterprise

539
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:15,099
don't use Evernote used you use
SharePoint and questioned over there

540
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:24,720
just a quick question so you put in a
lot of data we have not touched on the

541
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,618
kind of quality of dating called in
Alice's you have any tips tricks

542
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:34,140
whatever lessons learned about you know
managing quality of your throat until

543
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,279
like some of that is degrading

544
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:43,119
instructor is probably more important
you know how do you manage quality you

545
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:48,950
have a good lessons I think I mean my
philosophy is at least initially I don't

546
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:56,129
care about quality just give me the data
right on lemme store it right eye candy

547
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,299
determine if it's good or not

548
00:51:58,299 --> 00:52:03,339
later when I'm investigating an incident
and i can see you like overlook this

549
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:09,970
this piece of this indicator that I got
from this feed is relevant in this is

550
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,868
great so then I can go back and use
theirs Italian structure for quality

551
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:18,369
there so I can say oh this is high
quality medium quality low but by

552
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:25,289
default it's just assumed low but in the
end you could trend that over time in in

553
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:31,739
see well on the cases that were
investigating you know we tend to be

554
00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:36,489
using this feed more and it's relevant
to us so you could train that over time

555
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:44,819
and use that to maybe wait you know this
feed more than more than that feed ya

556
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:48,109
quality is hard

557
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:53,150
the best quality personally I think is
going to be like if you have is going to

558
00:52:53,150 --> 00:53:00,640
be internally generated data so if
you're like many parts or whatever I

559
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,049
mean that's gonna be really relevant but
the thing is is this gets you started so

560
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:12,670
that you can stop and eventually get
towards building an indicator dade

561
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:16,839
database that that's really row relevant

562
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:24,739
to view your specific organization that
he answers your question but yeah so

563
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:32,219
it's there is no its work is is what it
is right there's no there there is no

564
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:37,779
easy solution for it you you gotta put
in hours and I mean that's what Dave

565
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:42,690
Kennedy was talking about this morning
where it comes back to appeal to people

566
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:49,269
like you can buy all these tools and you
can set them up you know no one is using

567
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:54,660
them no one's monitoring them you know
it comes back to the people that are

568
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:16,930
using those tools to do their job so any
other questions so all these feeds the

569
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:21,038
problem is you're not really getting a
lot of good contacts from these seats so

570
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,609
I'm gonna give you ideas to gonna give
me stuff but if you look at like the

571
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:28,339
permanent stain on the top of that is
your DVDs

572
00:54:28,339 --> 00:54:35,019
exactly where the teepees that they use
if you have in your environment you see

573
00:54:35,019 --> 00:54:39,200
particular things happening that you
associate with a particular threat actor

574
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,450
ya already have intelligence not just
like difference here scattered over the

575
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:49,979
place but if you see this along with
this then you can combine it into say

576
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:54,129
okay we need to look at this moment and
where that comes into effect is with the

577
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,069
analysis of that threat intelligence
which is like the best ways that I've

578
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:06,250
seen it on is basically it's like
everyone has value in this arena

579
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:09,650
you're looking at you have a bunch of
intelligence from incidents were you

580
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:15,030
seen this type of actors build a true
data base which links indicators

581
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:19,910
together and intelligent way to say ok
this IP strongly associated with this

582
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:25,020
actor of this is exactly like the
adversity that your dog made basically

583
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,210
in that what building that you never
know what I think could be a little bit

584
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:32,310
tricky I so I just wanted to make it
clear to people that say this is good

585
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:35,880
for open source intelligence and get you
so far but if you really wanna know

586
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,110
what's happening in your environment eg
only with like a serious threat since

587
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:44,470
you could have difficulties building
they correct intelligence on it

588
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:50,620
yeah yeah I mean I agree I think part of
it is I don't know if I kept this ride

589
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:55,509
but like there's a lot of stuff in your
organization that's going on in the big

590
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:02,040
problem like open source in 2009 it take
you so so far but you know there's like

591
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,450
your case tracking system there's your
internal logs ideally you would be like

592
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:12,830
year you have to do the work and put in
the analysis time using the information

593
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:16,569
that is at least at this point is
centralized so that you can go up to the

594
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:24,850
top of the stack in bill does TDP so it
could be done I think you know this is

595
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:31,950
only ever know I'm not suggesting if if
you don't have nothing ever know it's a

596
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,270
great place to start wearing what you
need right eventually you're going

597
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:41,370
through this process you're going to
determine where your true requirements

598
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:46,560
are and that can help you buy the rate
enterprise solutions but this is just a

599
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:51,430
way to start out for people that are
doing nothing right to still so they to

600
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,919
give that you know this whole this whole
thing started with me as an analyst

601
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,340
trying to understand lake in alert pops
and I basically have nothing nowhere to

602
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,420
go

603
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,350
rate at least you know using something
like this can can help me at least give

604
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:12,910
me some data points that maybe I can get
off can bring me back but

605
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,509
you know currently if you don't have
anything I think this is great great way

606
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:24,580
to get started so I think amount of time
so anyway thank you thanks once again
