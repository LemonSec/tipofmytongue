1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,560
I like to welcome the next year's
figures in russia they have a combined

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,219
experience for more than 10 years in
ninety security and they're going to

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,139
talk about invisibility and how to
handle that I like to give a warm

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:01:47,390
welcome to and I should be done

5
00:01:47,390 --> 00:04:17,500
address has a society that lets me be
more confusion that there was a MAC

6
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,200
address see MAC address there was no
society to idealize there wasn't a

7
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:33,650
society for other devices are
approaching so I have been attacked yes

8
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:43,700
but and this is the current state of
WiFi open wifi nowadays we we are here

9
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,020
to propose an approach proposed fee
approaches that could reveal the

10
00:04:50,020 --> 00:05:01,159
communication that I actually experience
today let's get into some technical

11
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:13,810
details on this party is interaction
some details that have already good

12
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:20,760
communication the approaches that we are
presenting and euphoria in this approach

13
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,169
we are actually doing some dinner
trafficking into some frames actually

14
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,070
sending on to some data which are

15
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:38,250
actually expect that did I will be
sitting as we all nodded I sitting in

16
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:45,190
the payload but there are other ways
some very can certainly does the next

17
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:53,950
episode with the patch peloton approach
will be using there are many things that

18
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:02,590
we have known during this experience and
during this discussion I would say and

19
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,950
we are still learning and we will be
still working on some potential

20
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,430
approaches there are few other
approaches as well but they are not

21
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:31,870
considered that intrusions and
acknowledgement that right I mean people

22
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,790
they might be like light infantry or I
mean you might not be able to stand for

23
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:50,640
this was a couple of years back we
started this explosion and but later on

24
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,640
we got to lose you got things sorted out
things are falling in place and then we

25
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:15,180
were able to say yes so now we are like
what we just don't trust me loads the

26
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:23,280
data reflecting using some of the
freemen because we'll be discussing be

27
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,039
able to that the story behind

28
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,880
the story behind all of this is like
there are few and enjoy pieces in the

29
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:40,409
book that is ideally 80 do not levin
which is a good book

30
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:53,320
gradebook 6,000 pages book read it but
they they have closed everything in that

31
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:12,180
they have suggested of any legitimate
and very but they are unwittingly helped

32
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:22,800
you entered disclosing few things they
have to disclosing who feels like that

33
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:44,380
that can be otherwise used and less
access access points are used as a drug

34
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:57,120
dealer and they can be connected to
people whose for sending out and can be

35
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,990
used when connected access point to
access point and from the internet and

36
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:13,800
by that would not sufficient I know

37
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:26,469
the basics

38
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:37,149
my father very famous either side of my
reaction was like even open my files are

39
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:50,269
more prone to attacks on rebel and yes
they are like nowadays we need to do we

40
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:57,220
need approved to call me maybe may not
be so there's a hole in the network

41
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,019
parameter wub

42
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:15,750
this is two thousand and right now we
need a couple of minutes now most of the

43
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:25,839
industry's don't use this past bad
connotations admin admin admin password

44
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:41,520
password password so this is finds
eavesdropping and social identity

45
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:55,020
and connectivity myself the these are
all things that are adding to my device

46
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:01,920
these are a few more victims like mobile
phones cameras printers gaming consoles

47
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:22,790
laptops desktops are denied and the data
right now today I see us that is also

48
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:40,920
more prone to be a meeting its rotation
that can be used like managed management

49
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:49,079
interface card access station and I
don't think also a form of managed mode

50
00:11:49,080 --> 00:12:01,150
can be used and that is a valid question
master mode that I feel relations in

51
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,980
this case that will come back to this
point leader on this morning monitor

52
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:16,250
mode choose everything seen my radio

53
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:40,310
me and 400 the communication guide you
through this information in their career

54
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,829
of information security of say that like
what actually occasion is in competition

55
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,550
greedy ordinarily the type of computer
security attack that cleared the ability

56
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,660
to transfer information objects between
processes that not supposed to be

57
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,260
allowed to communicate by the computer
security policy making it more simple

58
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:10,560
ways to smoke later on to any chance we
can see also markets really basically

59
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:18,979
deals with candles which are poured into
wireless so using various less

60
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:26,940
individuals in this particular dog will
be dealing more with battling clear yeah

61
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,490
I mean if we go through the application
layer of different types of registry can

62
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,640
implement in order to reach in order to
achieve greatness as communication is

63
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:51,660
concerned i mean basically be concerned
brought before giving me some

64
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,300
understanding on the 11th green slick
Wireless trains and the types so there

65
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,339
are basically management dreams Controls
Engineer defense so management firms and

66
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,620
the state few of them here like
Association requests and responses

67
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,839
Association be questioned response probe
request and response beacon frames so on

68
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,020
and so forth there are actually blood or
officers friendship but our interest

69
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,880
thing that we tried experiment that was
upon request and response and beacons

70
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,300
going for ya this is just a formality as
you mentioned like management control

71
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,020
and disseminating them here so it is
like dreams ideas thanks for the

72
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:48,560
question saying that for clear loser is
he gave his fall so on and so very

73
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,959
differently I don't know this is not so
let's go to the question approach that

74
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,740
was proposed to achieve a rather to
smuggle a doubt over alleged emailed

75
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,480
wireless channel the name of their
double period as alcohol and there's

76
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,980
actually have brought this time from
escaping terminology available use a

77
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,740
particular field or other particular
caste record or 11 be sure that actually

78
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:28,990
enforce to informational email to
confirm is essential element in the

79
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,920
wireless networks yes be confirmed
popular with the rate of around 100

80
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:45,510
milliseconds around permanent we receive
680 confirms number available to local

81
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:52,490
radio para free to their broadcast yeah
that is I don't want ages with us and

82
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,680
they do not require any other indication
or association that access point to

83
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:06,939
listen to them so basic structure of the
country music here we can see out of

84
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:14,810
there as of now we will be focusing more
on to this parameter stands for traffic

85
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:25,109
conditions rail companies

86
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,240
Wikipedia this actually does like how
access point is advertising beacon frame

87
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,790
so when 2011 began frame is injected
into the local paper rewarding does it

88
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:45,089
actually is a broadcast receiver address
its gonna be on FB and they will be in a

89
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:52,110
society which would be a big impression
that all of us know about me confirm

90
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:57,480
right there are certain parameters as
well which can be used in order to

91
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:22,569
traffic data within a society broken so
here we have connected to their device

92
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:30,520
so and some cash for overlap this
particular society is so tomorrow I

93
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,750
figured maybe another hotel let's call
it is in the hotel and then I just

94
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:50,890
started my wireless feature finds that
is like just to see like in past I was

95
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:58,299
gonna do go on as a network is that
network available into this is a global

96
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,639
video predatory

97
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,730
check that it went into exile and
friends of friends and nothing but prob

98
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,120
requests and if these requests received

99
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,668
legitimate response then there is the
difference between beacon frame and

100
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:24,110
request response as far as farmers is
concerned it's only couple of

101
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:34,080
fields are actually some type of 0
exercise in Castle Rock requested is a

102
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:45,110
real difference i think thats elaborate
about robert Winston response so how do

103
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:52,610
these friends and in the fields which
have been a lens in order to ship data

104
00:18:52,610 --> 00:19:07,360
so going further like certain people
certain piece of information that's hard

105
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,399
when somebody some different properties
of that particular wireless network

106
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,240
interface cards concern into that
context so interesting elements like

107
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:30,890
this particular information element has
255 256 different variants according to

108
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,049
the IWW

109
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:41,650
been released in late 2006 possibilities
of information as of now there are a

110
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:47,860
hundred and twenty-one information
elements practice out of them we have a

111
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,120
couple of them for experimentation so
some other interesting elements we have

112
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,010
israeli areas and societies Transport
Service said identifier NBS said kind of

113
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:07,140
against use BR em strong indication
rates

114
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:18,610
again different parameter recently we
found some juicy about this as well and

115
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,639
country yes again this particularly
important for Public leadership over

116
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:34,920
legitimate chance so we began our
programs these dreams they do not

117
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,110
require authentication or association
himself being broadcast so no need 20

118
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,560
post-election like we need new york
pinpoint one particular host in order to

119
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,470
run and how did you know that would have
been a test case we have to take in

120
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,140
consideration

121
00:20:53,140 --> 00:21:02,860
just busting our presence of these range
in my local monastery very common and

122
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:08,959
escaped the specialized in the issue
there would be some reading devices

123
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,060
there would be some monitoring devices
so instead of 600 there might be some

124
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:22,100
6,000 begin french President per second
but activity will be logged in case of

125
00:21:22,100 --> 00:22:02,800
reading devices for that matter again so
they are pretty much

126
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:12,060
just to mention what we will be taking
into consideration that is why I am

127
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:21,570
indication so if we bring down to
business again we will see that there is

128
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:26,610
a particular field called partial
fortune but my this is the field which

129
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:37,300
allows you should data between 12 51
bytes which otherwise is used when your

130
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:49,720
card is in sleep mode Saudi I am
relieved with easy to fabricate the

131
00:22:49,720 --> 00:23:01,860
freemen's AP but this information so I
just have repaired one probe request was

132
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,879
basically because I like three min
escapee

133
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,030
freedom was getting prepared on my
machine was getting into preterm icon

134
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,510
but it was not as keeping my machine
somehow I was unable to broadcast that

135
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:23,050
particular reason I have taken another
request and experimented same thing if

136
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,860
you see here

137
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:40,729
this right which otherwise is not
drafted or automatically using your

138
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:51,670
drivers who may be using it and if we
see the translation of particular we can

139
00:23:51,670 --> 00:24:01,419
see some meaningful texts so I have
actually died right some script which

140
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:19,370
was very well walking four blocks this
is a new book I'm sorry this is a bad

141
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,178
idea right so I have actually important
everything from skipping ordered to

142
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:32,700
undergo a pipeline and why I put my
network interface cards my country and

143
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,419
destination MAC address yeah I kept it
publicly broadcast because it is a

144
00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,230
problem question it has to be released
every network interface card every

145
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:49,110
intelligent wireless network device
presented to the local radio then

146
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:57,290
society I have certain parameters here
for a society that is not eleven idea is

147
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:04,070
a society and information this is
nothing but the name of a society is so

148
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,480
far I have again prepared

149
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:19,440
another construct and I dislike
available so here we have put in ideas 8

150
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:27,919
p.m. there is nothing but the name of
information in for a just and then I

151
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:36,530
have these particular construction over
each other in order to get out of here

152
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:45,660
this is the frame I cried when I try to
run this I don't know it is giving me

153
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:53,370
some including just have come across so
I could not rectifier but earlier with

154
00:25:53,370 --> 00:26:00,010
some certain pics maybe if we can make
it run properly in order to ship this

155
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:06,830
particular date as far as I know I am
using certain by John actually Russian

156
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:14,590
Court here are intended over there would
be requiring some some workaround for

157
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,980
that let you know how this particular
rushing toward will be greeted by with

158
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:28,169
them like I actually will be lining or
maybe we need to find the wireless

159
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:39,850
driver for the quarter can produce some
good output and maybe she'll so this is

160
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,909
what we've been trying to achieve but
this is why we have made it work so the

161
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:50,320
reason we can see this screen capture

162
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,189
issues with this approach yeah

163
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:02,929
if somebody's going to deep packet
inspection firewall there will be

164
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:07,129
suspicious alarm generated for this
because we are shipping a lot of data

165
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:11,789
into some element which otherwise is not
supposed to send such a huge chunk of

166
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:21,299
data regarding the data is not taken
care of before showing in the data I

167
00:27:21,299 --> 00:28:00,539
have to like he is very well but if my
decides is beyond Boothby by the issue

168
00:28:00,539 --> 00:29:01,260
we have

169
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:30,270
just because it's supposed to be sent
for a particular Communication which is

170
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:36,080
already been initiated so this will not
actually helping case of broadcasting

171
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,629
attacks against it to act responsibly
ames significance to reply to Chardon

172
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:48,400
communication initiated by the remote
host earlier so we are in some comfort

173
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,420
zone we know there is some communication
initiated there is already some

174
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:59,080
information exchange happened so now can
we ride certainly over these extremely

175
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:05,350
responsive aims to the press is already
in place between two hosts responses by

176
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,959
unsolicited user will receive legal low
priority of inspection as it as it has

177
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,110
assumed that such responses about the
gun from a legend shows on peripheral

178
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:23,010
devices I think this approach with the
euphoria will give solution to the

179
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:28,570
sequencing issue why just because
already there is some sort of activity

180
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:35,040
done so to have this particular activity
there is some sequential mechanism

181
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,450
already in place so we need not reach in
Wendover he relied airborne logic in

182
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,280
order to generate that quenching
mechanism response to africa is always

183
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,430
made more intelligent as there are
capable of as they are capable of

184
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,730
designing segments

185
00:30:51,730 --> 00:31:03,040
undisciplined traffic as I have just
explained you could come handy are more

186
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,840
more fragments sequence numbers
basically is an essential source address

187
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:18,379
so what actually really is like we have
included in the data and should be over

188
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,820
trip to Dover and ECG response against
it before doing that and coordinate W

189
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:32,409
certain logic and lodging and murdered
and pre shared with the user in the

190
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:40,600
parameter so you will use the idea
parameter thing and then we have shipped

191
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:48,990
over this secret was already pre shared
with other party and then we have a

192
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:58,890
special acknowledgment this may actually
we are actually going into the call

193
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:04,530
stack we are changing certain things so
this may not always abide by the rules

194
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:10,660
which are produced when do I W dot 11
standards there might be some diversion

195
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:17,320
and yes we did so resulting in more
organ immune more control over their yes

196
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,429
that is possible just because we are
ordering almost everything that is

197
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:31,210
needed to make a conduit issues yes we
still may be facing issues from animal

198
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:41,180
detection based firewalls can see the
last friends are still an issue again

199
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:46,320
this year but as far as lost limbs are
concerned there is actually no clue that

200
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,149
there is something which means sent from
those people whose be so how do how do

201
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:57,330
make it to husband have no mechanism to
gather this intelligence hands all began

202
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,540
with actually they'll host a key I'm
getting this award because I did not

203
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,920
receive the stream so this thing is
still missing

204
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,840
so the Proteas

205
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,750
upon them

206
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:19,390
there are certain more fields we have
been considering hiring show is the

207
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:28,410
things he had not occurred in fact what
we are doing yet we are doing that

208
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:42,900
initially what we are trying to patch
drivers so what we found your visibility

209
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,380
in there this approach fairly medicare's
the issues we have confronted in the

210
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,950
previous approaches having this it is
truly covered conduits are doubtful

211
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:57,840
securing the communication of the year
before we proceed further this

212
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,290
particular don't approach is actually
inspired by the work of art and beauty

213
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:10,239
he's researcher in 2006 black hard BC he
have actually produce research on seem

214
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,080
covert channel and covert communication
we have used rubber backing itself with

215
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,350
the battery does he use for driver
budging read different and the back but

216
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,860
does that very using for everybody here
are different

217
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:29,129
truly speaking July just having I just
am having is mentioned in the stock

218
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:35,230
because I actually my inspiration
basically in this so the best guess we

219
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:42,918
should we have the highest and best when
this is done we have prepared to host to

220
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:49,480
one post is having a rather these two
horse having bashed drivers we have used

221
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,990
Unix machines because these things were
more on Unix machines having known and

222
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:57,810
things like that

223
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:02,900
Windows machines also we have used in
order to check whether to go for

224
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,820
drafting the group trying to do

225
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,230
using this fashion drivers with their
dad is predictable and badge machines as

226
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:16,250
well or scanning stuff so what we've
done is likely have raised an access

227
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,550
point on one Linux machine bar dining on
March two more with having the patch

228
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,930
drivers and apple on it

229
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,379
the machines with and bash brothers will
not be able to see the engineer traffic

230
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,000
the machines with bad drivers will be
able to communicate reader devices

231
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:44,599
having somebody having symbol of
cardstock so for the detailing do this

232
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:54,950
work we actually tried to patch it was
like for for allegedly might reconsider

233
00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,430
that is one reason like analogously
India so I figured if we see like it and

234
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:04,058
I'll be back in there are you wouldn't I
mean who had enjoyed since he'll be

235
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:07,300
considered it is either 406

236
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:18,099
same time if we consider into the
wireless so far back what we try to do

237
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:32,119
is likely have changed that hand crafted
with Virgin feelers been otherwise will

238
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:37,760
be dropped by those all posts which are
not actually having a patch driver

239
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:45,119
wedding kids of each driver this
particular frame may be interpreted by

240
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,549
colonel and will be friends for the
appropriate process so the deductions

241
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:56,839
from abroad are engineered by country
access points with passion for the call

242
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:02,578
stack and ordered by the devices having
a bash protocols either

243
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:07,190
probes conducted by devices with
back-to-back on stacks whereby the

244
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:12,400
devices with unpatched version of
protocol stacks the first gave little

245
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,530
variation in there we have received from
Benjamin sometimes we have experienced a

246
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:24,960
lot of driver we have experienced a lot
of crashes when we are still facing that

247
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,540
thing actually as right now we are
running majority of Linux

248
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:37,950
so this experimentation on basically
done on gonna do point six

249
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:44,100
the Starbucks postcard that
implementations feeling somehow so I

250
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:52,920
could not produce the good thing is
pretty much what are we really don't so

251
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,850
we can see in some cases devices with
unprofor the call stack were not able to

252
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:08,870
staff engineer trafficker dog and
sometimes give it to your advantage here

253
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:15,850
in in-house solutions or maybe getting
majority of attacks in wireless

254
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:21,630
infrastructure partial occurrence of
event horizon in wireless networks is

255
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:26,960
very much achievable using this approach
yeah because we are sending certainly

256
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,050
damage is only viewable by certain
candles or rather incredible by certain

257
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:36,440
drivers which abolished so sometimes I
feel like I'm training data from me to

258
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,290
see if she's trying to bridge back from
Wednesday's eliminated this would be

259
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:56,480
because most be so you will always
receive certain I see me back to who's

260
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:07,860
this actually if we will bring back this
business actually require a lot of

261
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,190
credit we just need to run the patch on
to our driver when she moves mood so

262
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,620
requires no great deal of changes in
operating moments of the past

263
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,740
drivers no cost low effort solution
would say is this thing working with

264
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,640
Kleenex boxes northern the windows we
are yet to do these things when Windows

265
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:41,100
boxes so what we're learning all the
time relying upon skippy for injection

266
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:48,640
poppers for graphing purpose but it's
been some like building streams in

267
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,450
skimpy use mirrors

268
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,710
do certain output which are like totally
absurd and that will actually language

269
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:16,570
just takes a lot of input from various
social and casual 4.6 retardant certain

270
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:23,700
resources from operating system as well
so it's not it's not your driver you

271
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,859
supposed to bad we need to take care of
certain resources from operating system

272
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:35,800
as well so that is actually from
compiling the shooting properly 24 point

273
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:49,160
X yeah so far as I know like there are
several different requests and responses

274
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,029
agencies including commission element
we've come across regional game capable

275
00:40:54,030 --> 00:41:06,630
of data to identify that PPC request and
response are capable of more than 200

276
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:16,290
bytes again we have testing PCB BBC the
responses but we do not request properly

277
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:22,900
yesterday only I was able to find the
country the name of this particular

278
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:32,510
information element I D is country this
again is capable of Sebring to physics

279
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:39,870
by two so this can again be explored in
a proper way in order 20 or other

280
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:48,000
smuggled a dog over alleged change so as
early as well agree have explored only

281
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,010
watching really

282
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,680
diverging there are many movies yeah
there was a question why specifically

283
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,149
version feel we have picked up it was
just because that was the constant for

284
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,970
you we have used but apart from that
there are many of the field as well like

285
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,950
there are certain fields which are lying
around the park management sergeant

286
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:15,819
enjoying the rain controls against
doctors its he is so these field also

287
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:25,420
will actually help us coming of it some
different type of general yes an

288
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:34,880
interesting area so far my ps3 ps4
