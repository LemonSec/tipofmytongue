1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:08,459
our next speaker for today is scuba I
hope I pronounced it right he's known

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:13,498
for his work at Yelp and they all talk
about ways its collector collector which

3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:15,779
is intruder

4
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:28,259
isn't responsible for OSX thank you ever
so yeah let's start at the very

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,170
beginning I joined the up security in
about a year ago in July before that I

6
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,930
was working

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,400
that's a pain so that it wasn't brands
for about two-and-a-half yes at like

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,260
most involved in another incident
response also working on the meeting our

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:56,629
security processes and apologize from
France's the tax collector project I was

10
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,610
feeling of deja ver si of Science and
Technology Co and also double diploma

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:10,470
program works TVersity in France Spartak
so maybe for those of you who don't know

12
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,160
much about to help your piece
crowdsource radio website for local

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:22,000
businesses we also mobile applications
we also have for instance applications

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,869
for table reservations for delivery I
was actually just having a time slot

15
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,700
just before lunch maybe not a good thing
to talk about it because you probably

16
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,210
gonna start like yelping places where
you wanna grab something to eat up their

17
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,110
attack but bear with me i hope i didnt
less than one hour so if you're not

18
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,450
hungry enough like

19
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,460
unique visitors on a mobile application
the same number actually of review since

20
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,288
the inception the website of the website
eleven years ago most of them are

21
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:09,160
calling coming now a days from mobile
applications run 68% and we're in 42

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,709
countries right now with each other in
tehran like more than 3,000 employees

23
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:23,470
worldwide and Muslim are using Macs and
you might realize that my books were

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:33,829
deemed as a quite secure laptops
operating system this is no longer the

25
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:39,130
case I guess they're kind of the victims
of their own popularity because nowadays

26
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:47,739
people are really also trying to find
some vulnerabilities and also attack

27
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,069
users of this operating system so for
instance you could download anything

28
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:59,750
like Video Converter for Mac Berg this
will usually come by and for instance

29
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:08,670
which is run by CNET used to package
malware so first hand is like just block

30
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:16,730
download.com don't allow your corporate
users to to to go visit this website and

31
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,660
our malware incident response used to
look like that basically whenever there

32
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,639
was like some antivirus alert which is
used to wipe the machine gun do much

33
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,950
with that and this was so the

34
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:39,069
very advanced way of dealing with things
we used to see the same taxes over a

35
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,970
gallon a week there was only so much you
can do about that because there was no

36
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,430
existing tool that could help us with
analyzing them section so that make most

37
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,750
of our users really sad time with you
out like hey let's resume builder a

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:01,440
couple of tools over the open source
doing similar stuff for instance Isaacs

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,680
auditor was similar to but we also
wanted to add some stuff about that so

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,660
we open source OS X Factor which is why
we're friends 6 gathering tool for

41
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:23,110
almost an hour just one by one
firefighter basically whenever we found

42
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,120
out there is like infected machine on
our work we used to just grab it

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,540
of the network to stop any further
proliferation just get the script error

44
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,150
so with USB stick

45
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,539
maybe not for risky bet networks around
so much about that

46
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:45,590
grab the spot on a condom machine run
the script get the output and done

47
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:53,630
further analysis what this iPhone by
restoring it basically is collecting all

48
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,030
different system

49
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:02,020
system diagnostic and France's browser
history and putting it in a very easy

50
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:10,030
way to understand before machine so far
at the motel hours and 40 mins so we

51
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:16,770
started doing this with Jason let me
just see how many of you are actually

52
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:26,940
using my books and like I said ok so
I'll try to maybe to someone so way of

53
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,130
connecting with other operating systems
like windows because you know like for

54
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,640
Windows most of the system information
store in the registry similar 000 stands

55
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,820
stores most of this information
properties about system is quite

56
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,940
databases or something they called this
property list and is very easy to for

57
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:58,780
instance damp content of a school ID
database with my son is just like eight

58
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:05,059
lines I think the script so this is one
of one of the things that are going to

59
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,830
scrubbing system properties from all
different SQLite databases on our son

60
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:18,060
system also for Proposal least some of
them are you there in like something

61
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,990
like binary format or plain text it
basically dropped from other sources and

62
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:34,130
put them back into this concise from our
operation and tree foundation library

63
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,280
which is so nice way to rub Objective C
calls as you see from this light

64
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,770
Objective C kind of like very lengthy
names which is maybe not but very

65
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,240
powerful new way of doing things so that
cold over there looks a bit weird like

66
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,410
sometimes Obama ended as quite lengthy
names but basically what they're doing

67
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,820
is just like using this foundation
library two to grab something like for

68
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,270
instance ballistic content and

69
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,740
converted into adjacent former but it's
very easy way forward as one nation

70
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:13,890
library and foundation is found on all
machines running western so you don't

71
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,360
really need and dependencies to run the
scripts who dis as we're doing it we

72
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,130
just grab that this one bison file on
the machine and run it without any

73
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:30,370
installing anything else this is a list
of different things that this place able

74
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,490
to to collect from the operating system
so as I was saying for instance browser

75
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,950
history Chrome extensions

76
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,750
thinks that I running current teams in
mind for which is mostly like

77
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,770
attachments people are using the default
email application for their for their

78
00:07:52,770 --> 00:08:05,430
emails and also downloads from which are
pretty much most of that coming from so

79
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:12,230
what I was exposed to producers is the
sort of list of Jason blog entries they

80
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,410
all contain some common case for
instance like path of the file from

81
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,210
downloads directory or or kernel
extension or over the place was taken

82
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:29,520
from some hashes timestamps signature
change as you see on this flight here

83
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:41,120
which can give us some indication during
the analysis process some more aware

84
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,490
or some for instance and defied check
some suspicious on the startup items

85
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,650
this is pretty much like indication that
the el-ad swiped a special teams so we

86
00:08:51,650 --> 00:09:00,529
don't do that here I'm stumps are quite
important as well we thank for that

87
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:08,120
reason for doing is like unifying demo
described the simple format which it may

88
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,839
be like easy to say now but different
applications for instance Firefox Safari

89
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:22,040
they use different ways of doing time
stamps these using their own way like

90
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,660
think milliseconds from 2001

91
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,189
seconds from a bug and all the different
ways of converting basically recording

92
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,130
time so as I was expecting describing
them all into this one from other ways

93
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:43,830
both human readable and machine-readable
for further notice is important we

94
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,329
believe show it's basically dumping all
different sizes of any file

95
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:53,670
that's all i can download directory or
applications directory and this is very

96
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,439
useful for the analysis if you see
suspicious file Hashem in this

97
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:05,610
indication something's going going on
there own themes for those of you who

98
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,589
are not my keys nurses are sort of this
warnings were you a little something

99
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:16,569
from the internet and you try to open at
your operating system will warn you

100
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:26,599
about that just click open open most of
these are at least do it and we still

101
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,699
have indication of where the fire came
from because the scoring teams are

102
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,790
staying forever

103
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,529
displaced so we can grab easily
formation where the file was downloaded

104
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,040
from and when that happened

105
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,160
which agent name so for instance here
was steve was a follow-up from so we can

106
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,800
call eight different events

107
00:10:51,800 --> 00:11:05,099
the other thing pretty similar to extend
that will be at work from this number of

108
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,579
very very nicely integrated into our
stand which just give you clear

109
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,519
indication where fire came from
something you can just from the common

110
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,889
line here we we use some library

111
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:26,430
basically one of the Foundation's
library goals to grab the information

112
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,300
where the fuck I'm father came from
where you see multiple URLs here is

113
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,939
because it's clever that some of the
brothers it's only containing like they

114
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:43,800
actually download URL but also refers so
it can give you any information also not

115
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,329
only where the fire was directed the
film but also their website that user

116
00:11:48,329 --> 00:12:02,388
got the redirected to redirect this from
two to open this file might come useful

117
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:10,699
during the analysis of the impaction
surprisingly novelist and doesn't care

118
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:15,490
that much about significant change but
so they don't display any warnings and

119
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,410
so forth 11 binary star outside but this
can be quite useful during the deal is

120
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:29,920
so pretty much a part but OSX collector
can do

121
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,229
how it is doing it but just grabbing all
these different foreign sings during the

122
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,490
day is OK

123
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,170
like sort of cool part it's good to have
to take your time rob you can you don't

124
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,110
need to offer that it will just take a
hold of time so we are delighted that

125
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,480
work deserves a better script but
actually used to waste a lot of time

126
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,209
just analyzing it because for instance
for the machine that was running like

127
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:07,420
couple of months this power have sound
like a couple of my guides so you can

128
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,240
imagine how many Jason entries can fit
into that so just going through that

129
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:21,660
it's not really that much it's a
fascinating for someone who really wants

130
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,160
to have like immediate answers for the
questions like where the smaller came

131
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:34,839
from so basically what we are doing
mainly with this output is for instance

132
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,690
where we have like incident I'm still be
there from like antivirus or early like

133
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:48,110
fire I cycled sort of boxes weekend just
clearly grabber on this you can easily

134
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,800
put up upper the Vikes collector with
tools like Jake you this is sort of like

135
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:00,310
a nice way to query Jason and displayed
a nice format so for instance can like

136
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,339
display you all the URLs that user
visited and if you like parrot with grab

137
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:13,290
it can be like during this time frame
the user visits all these different URLs

138
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:20,829
clear indication like where that came
from

139
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:28,550
like Alexandria's and if you tried like
reprimanded jules is clearly

140
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:36,089
like doing it for like an hour like way
too too much so yeah it's quite like

141
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,779
everyday was like dozens of incidents
like oh yeah let's grab her on their

142
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:45,220
time stamp LED display you're always
lets try to figure out a result or

143
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:52,160
opinions like those euros bad or not
it's it will just take hold of time so

144
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,060
we sound like a way to make that part as
well so we've been sort of a second to

145
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,949
kind of a wraparound the tax collector
that can go up the output of at all so

146
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:10,540
all these different for instance entries
and just a nice democratically so for

147
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,269
instance it will go away

148
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:19,560
directly looking at certain times times
trying to correlate this with your calls

149
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,750
at this time some sort of connected to
try to grab some more data about your

150
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:34,110
else from places like liars total or if
you use OpenDNS investigate and try to

151
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:41,589
address is in the shop with this
information we call them because they

152
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:50,160
sort of go around all these different
Jason out with entries and try to reach

153
00:15:50,160 --> 00:16:00,640
them away like filtering them around
this is kind of a chain of all these

154
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,290
different filters you can see here

155
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:11,139
for instance we start with just directly
and reaching the information finding all

156
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:18,410
the comments related to certain three
sources we have like long UL Listed

157
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:26,219
extracts heard about all different
subdomains domains from Premier all the

158
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:36,420
way it's very simple is basically just
basically twice to like rap the one of

159
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:45,029
the entries in Jason object and then I
cut some more information into it so in

160
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,579
that case is libelous or as I like to
underscore domains with all the

161
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:55,979
different domains extracted from the
from the ural here is very very example

162
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:03,089
get there is there is not so much but
for instance you hold up for like the

163
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:08,020
longer you're also some other domains in
the query parameters he'll also

164
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:15,520
extracted from them so there was like 10
containing 344 like a return address and

165
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,750
the laws of this wonder what we we are
doing with this

166
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:28,800
URLs dominance you can check them on
their internal black list so this will

167
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:35,669
give us immediate information about like
a year we've seen this your domain in

168
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,970
the past we sort of highlight of this is
a bad or good because it can also check

169
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,940
them against white least and already
from that we can grab some first let's

170
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:51,580
say indication whether this we've
already seen in similar incident or is

171
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,379
it something new that we should block
likely to sort of kind of clever way of

172
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:04,270
doing it because you can also have some
projects around it apart from exact

173
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:15,860
match and internal black ass is not
enough we can go so far as total in this

174
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:21,409
case we can for instance rubber harshest
and DirectAdmin the output of things

175
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,010
that we found out from Brazil API what
we were doing also we put certain

176
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,500
thresholds around this values that we
received two princes we had like three

177
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,060
positive hits from Aristotle we can say
like this is sort of suspicious lots a

178
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:48,210
work in progress around like which are
actually quite accurate for your

179
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:57,670
purposes you around different values
causes lots of different styles russians

180
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:04,660
here because like okay even some some
viewers with just one find if they're

181
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,440
like very very fresh

182
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,290
they could be valid as a suspicious is
quite cool about the way we worry

183
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,530
virus-stopping is that if you don't have
like the commercial license which allows

184
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,779
you to do like 25 goals

185
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,669
more than that you can

186
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:32,789
tolerate so we can stall nice results
were for web just like to be licensed

187
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:36,139
providers which I think it's like only
for calls per minute something like that

188
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:42,100
so yeah if you have like thousand euros
maybe it will want to really be very

189
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:50,359
super fast but we also sort of cash in
hand so what are you waiting for the

190
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,189
same year olds all over again just scrub
the results from that cash rather than

191
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:05,100
call it again so it can also speed up to
you about apart from buyers that we also

192
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:12,609
have other server harshly cap find
related fires filter which part of the

193
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:18,499
similar thing that this final related
domains filter which is a sort of like

194
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:26,109
grabbing all the friends out safe I'll
pop them to search for so just to grow

195
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,210
up like a court filing that could
indicate that something suspicious like

196
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:36,279
you have files that I like video
converter or download the resulting this

197
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,369
may already be quite nice indication
that this is something that you should

198
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:54,449
look at the the first disc different API
so that we can call it opened in israel

199
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,210
thomas was there is one of them opened
the US provides around eight nine

200
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,659
different and points one of them is is
this Thomas we find this one quite

201
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,480
useful because

202
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,810
as you as you can see like evil domain
sort of sit next to each other so if you

203
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:18,070
have like a related domains to us or
maybe not

204
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,760
suspiciously sounding domain maybe
they're related domains today sitting on

205
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,110
the same IP address they would be more
suspicious than this initial domain

206
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:41,780
another one from albany is also
reputation filter this is what they

207
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:50,690
called us like bread and like I said
before I like undervalues you you may

208
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:57,630
need to sort of tune em up for you so
one of them for instance like this

209
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,800
demand generation loggerheads car this
could indicate whether this ugly

210
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,540
generated in this case I guess it's
sounding not so much

211
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,250
randomly but they're like all those
different like domains that look like

212
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:20,570
random strings of some numbers and
characters like created for the sole

213
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:26,139
purpose of storing some sort of malware
on a tour like right direction for our

214
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:38,060
source and what was let's say a very at
the very end of running all these

215
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,870
filters business and of recommendation
part where based on these different

216
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:52,790
commented and raised in the jason walker
we can suggest certain actions as as a

217
00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:03,220
and a result of the analysis so you can
see here that found out some suspicious

218
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:12,610
download based on euros from attribute
names and Kansas princess yeah let's go

219
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,870
out and buy this domain

220
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:23,500
this is sort of like think you should do
this recommendation steps com sort of

221
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,330
all after like running all these filters
you can run them separately so for

222
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:34,720
instance if you don't have a license and
you feel like using this open licensees

223
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,390
maybe not enough because it's just like
not very time efficient you can just

224
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:48,850
like condolences use OpenDNS or this
file related domain filter or for

225
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,679
instance just your internal white lists
blacklisted or some other API said you

226
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,570
would feel like integrate into it does
recommendations that we can sort of also

227
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,310
get influenced by that so like there is
no magic into its just like looks at the

228
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,970
different like suspicious items from the
different API for your internal sources

229
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,950
and and highlights basically the things
you should look so I wouldn't say this

230
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:20,930
is the only thing that we do like it
obviously also require some sort of some

231
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:27,460
sort of mine yours to mention part but
it can give you a clear indication of

232
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:38,750
like which which parts of the system
where all this other stuff and it can

233
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,470
run it either separately or

234
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,630
10 others like one analyzed filter that
there were like other magic fingers like

235
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,909
crying all day P ice and all different
different kernel sources of information

236
00:24:51,909 --> 00:25:00,230
that you that you fit them into it but
we also down with the disaster of like

237
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:06,350
side work from from this project is like
out with filters and querying all these

238
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,189
different API's was the Fred until API
which we also open source of the

239
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:18,770
dependency of this of this output
filters project so basically you can now

240
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,470
have some sort of like a funny way of
calling virustotal opened it up and then

241
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:30,630
as already provided quite nice library
to call their endpoints others who were

242
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,240
so sure there's a racer top like this
white lace approach where they basically

243
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:42,840
based on the hash tried to tell you
whether this is legitimate or something

244
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,668
that they don't have information about
so I from library to call this a

245
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,669
different time points so if you have the
investor opinions investigate a parade

246
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:01,960
with this will allow you for instance to
things like set of demands we as I was

247
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,320
mentioned before we sort of like an
alleged with this cache mechanism it's

248
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,460
very simple I think it could be a bit
more clever in the future of any ideas

249
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,120
feel free to suggest something on the
online get up or get some sort of like

250
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:25,219
already something in mind justice
shutout currently just like cassius

251
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,730
existing response he doesn't have any
let's say

252
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:34,900
I am outraged 444 existing entries so I
can imagine that for something like IP

253
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,710
address or domain discourse and
announced that they will change over

254
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:46,419
time so it might make sense to have a
bit more clever just like touching the

255
00:26:46,419 --> 00:27:01,070
ground quite often I would imagine there
is not so much like a response like the

256
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,159
worst case you can just like this cash
for it will like try to build a fresh

257
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:14,080
for centuries again and again and we use
this road in the library not only for

258
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:22,790
the order was extracted project we also
one of my colleagues quentin he wrote a

259
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:28,418
tool called Lost Hero 2 which is sort of
like a way to alert elasticsearch data

260
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:39,410
so it's a very nice way of not only like
simple or illegal this information from

261
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,360
our success cluster but also like you
can just call the library you can just

262
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,189
grab for instance like five hostages
from the from los accept entries and

263
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,640
already called virustotal to have your
alerts and more information about

264
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,840
whether this is something suspicious or
not so we certify the light is very

265
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:09,290
different projects we do you have
something like that and then you have

266
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,149
some roads up there that you can just
like while they're eating you can

267
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:20,408
more information like from from virus
although Open DNS service error but then

268
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:22,309
there were the langs

269
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:25,899
some more intelligence into it I would
say like for instance this threshold

270
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:34,008
apply some sort of way off of altering
the other side are sort of maybe not

271
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:41,330
that critical to be something that
requires more attention around so you're

272
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,678
interested in that

273
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:48,909
go radar engineering rock actually he
was posted yesterday or two days ago so

274
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:58,889
it's one of the first article that
blessed with that like if you have any

275
00:28:58,889 --> 00:28:59,589
ideas

276
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:08,440
any any questions like you like me here
or such a discussion please send

277
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,559
requests if you have already something
in mind and already want to I called

278
00:29:12,559 --> 00:30:05,840
around the project if you have any
questions around here

279
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:14,459
which requires we do

280
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:37,590
here

281
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,520
questions
