sensitive so very happy to be here

5
00:00:37,530 --> 00:01:07,290
well these are things that happened
right but yeah we'll have to figure it

6
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,210
out but actually on the positive side we
actually have like I guess like the

7
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:18,288
biggest crowd ever so most people ever
we have like very good training at an

8
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:23,190
extensive amount of workshops and we
have something very exclusive mean we've

9
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:27,399
been like in the first time in many
years we are able to get like that again

10
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:33,080
still the best player in the world we've
been able to get quite certain cases

11
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,009
over here so I do encourage you guys to
give it a try it's lovely so as I said

12
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,530
in general it's there on the positive
side we happy to be here again we're

13
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,079
happy to see how many people actually
turn out so families three days like

14
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,298
them said we had this year more than 500
people attending group first of all a

15
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,600
couple of rules room for years has been
completely refurbished we have you see

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,630
everything that means that last year's
rule was no food no drinks in a room

17
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,530
this year has been enforced even more
honor one we have a couple of new things

18
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,720
this year this is the first year at ICS
village it is organized in the other

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:22,590
room things encourage you to go and see
what happens there

20
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,390
or points we have awesome regional here
if you are a fan of arcade games and

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,119
really all games of the eighties and
nineties we have a room with some of

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,549
those games it's upstairs on the balcony
an appointment to add about the

23
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:40,990
workshops

24
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,340
we didn't expect to have so much success
with the workshops organization and

25
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,090
people figured out they can register
online as was indicated on a website but

26
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,230
we forgot to put a cap on the number of
registrations which means that we have

27
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,049
so many order bookings we have tried to
remediated bits and we organized a core

28
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,530
class more works out so we create
another room so we create next to the

29
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:15,540
west we and we have a new room for as
well so we had additional training they

30
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,380
are still not on the schedule we were
released after this short presentation

31
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,920
and you will be able to register voters
will have an extra workshop I am the

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,420
category today between two and four we
have another workshop on kernel tales

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,420
and REM exploitations between 24 as well
we have another workshop

34
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,260
software-defined radios and other works
of mother a triage tomorrow afternoon

35
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,429
maybe we'll get one extra this will be
announced later on

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,189
are speaking of tomorrow Richard Heene
will not be able to fly to bed until his

37
00:03:54,189 --> 00:04:00,150
presentation we will try to accommodate
him with a Skype session we hope to be

38
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,410
working well but if it doesn't we will
find another solution for you

39
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:15,660
live from the internets this means that
there will be video shooting as well at

40
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,640
some point we'll try to make a shooting
of the room so if you don't want to be

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,000
films will announce it a trance and we
give you enough time to leave the room

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,960
before we take the shots I think that's
more or less about it regarding the

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,960
organization next to that

44
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,270
announced our next speaker he has been a
fantasy for more than 15 years has

45
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,690
encouraged many situations he is an
expert in writing testing in real-world

46
00:04:44,690 --> 00:05:09,360
attacks trainer in the nightmares been
testing carrier welcome

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:23,990
displaces the only thing this is this is
the security conference that when I

48
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,469
started traveling a lot

49
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:32,199
made me fall totally in love with going
to other cities to go talk about

50
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,620
security is when I was young I really
really enjoyed it I really enjoyed

51
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,620
seeing other people's perspective but
ever so window to being in like places

52
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,650
the USS that I could sneak on a train in
travel to because my parents sure his

53
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:54,388
homework gonna let me hit 16 go to Vegas
so I had to find my way there and I

54
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,729
found a way to a bunch security
conferences and it was fun it was

55
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,550
interesting and i got to need a lot of
the community there but when I came over

56
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:09,770
here it was totally different I saw this
really awesome connection to a community

57
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,409
that I felt like I lost in the states
and a lot of regard there was just

58
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:18,150
there's people that are to become sick
of it there's people that weren't doing

59
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:24,060
the same level of innovation and I came
here and I was so invigorated by just

60
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,490
the amount of talent in the amount of
cool things that everybody was doing and

61
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,569
the mixture of people from all over the
place that it just it it made me

62
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:38,870
insanely happy I remember that the first
week on the day went to I was sitting

63
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,460
there and it was this felt like I was at
some crazy you know TED talk or say

64
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,318
things like screens everywhere like cool
hip lighting like random rave music and

65
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:57,650
this is his thing I've ever done and
after I watched the first two talks

66
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:04,120
which I'm sure if any of you were were
there I i SAT up and speaker room and I

67
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,139
was like sitting on the edge watching
the talks and I talked sucks

68
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,699
really sucks and like now that all these
other people are doing really good talks

69
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:22,400
like screwed I should just delete
everything and give another talk so it

70
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,318
deleted it all and i SAT up there for
the rest of the first day watching dogs

71
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,349
and trying to build another talk that
didn't suffer as much as the first one

72
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,990
that I've made I'm not real sure how it
turned out but I felt like it was a

73
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,569
little bit better in the stuff that you
guys too has always inspired me to do

74
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,520
better in be better so I want to think
before I say anything the Buchan team

75
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,188
the staff here everything that you guys
do in all of you were sitting around for

76
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,710
at least if if I can thank you for
anything from making me force myself to

77
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,099
get better and force myself to learn and
force myself to know that I really don't

78
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,360
know a damn thing about this industry
even if they've been at it for a really

79
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:12,330
long time so thank you guys really

80
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:22,400
so I'm Chris whether it's a pirate or
business or random you know Communist

81
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,780
Manifesto gross I have disclaimers part
of my disclaimers are things like im

82
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,490
annoying and loud I think this is easier
for people who get really sensitive

83
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:38,789
about things and since I get to open it
up now it's it's a really low bar to

84
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:52,689
entry for everybody else uses fucked by
accident that's cool 84 people that's me

85
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,420
if you wanna get ahold of me in any way
or spamming or trolling me or whatever

86
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,699
else that's cool I don't mind that's the
places that I've worked in the world and

87
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,640
I've worked all over the world

88
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,660
done a bunch of stuff and security
that's the leg I'm legitimate really

89
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,490
listen to me I should talk about stuff
and really know what I'm doing but no

90
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:18,199
one really knows what theyre doing so
I'm company called glorious with my

91
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:23,279
partner Eric Smith and in some people
that made me feel like an idiot every

92
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:31,610
day which I appreciate we do stuff like
code review and testing we do some

93
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:41,959
incident response where would you risk
assessments physical security you

94
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,790
forensics you know we we do different
types of that material modeling and

95
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,920
attack or just watch screens that look
really pretty like tourists in the

96
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,399
background just cause it looks cool on
TV we depend testing which a few if any

97
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,370
of you have never seen this picture it's
so so it's a picture a hand to most of

98
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,080
our clients when they ask us for a pen
test and the like we were being serious

99
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:18,530
maybe you should read this and tell me
at what level do you want to happen I

100
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:25,470
love the rich kid just have a whole
bunch of tools like it work we do get to

101
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,730
me where we do better customer other
weird stuff whether it's adversarial

102
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,970
modeling and weighs whether it's
profiling adversaries and attacking the

103
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,090
way that we do you have 10 test that
lasts like two to five years longer

104
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,280
we're just looking for a specific
objective or trying to get to a point

105
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,130
where were in their manufacturing
process in order to make a part in

106
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,660
trying to compromise that particular
parts that we can show it said I don't

107
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,839
know a weapon system maybe when it gets
delivered ten years from now has a

108
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,200
specific vulnerability that I know
exists because I put it in 10 years

109
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,750
earlier and then we can walk up in the
field with things about the shoes have

110
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,500
liked a little magic click the button
below it today because that sucks treat

111
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,750
them like that's a real risk that's a
really big problem if somebody can do

112
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:31,430
that not just like showing a box there's
a power point of the bats good ok

113
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:36,959
so the the generic stacks of the world
of you guys read the Verizon DBA are and

114
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,320
stuff like that before it's really great
rich information source to scare the

115
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,330
shit out of people in order to give them
the ability to give you money to do the

116
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,860
job and also talks about all the
different types of attacks and stuff

117
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,820
that have been going on so every time I
look at this I get like the sad panda

118
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,279
face because we're just like the crappy
stock investors on earth we just put

119
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,480
more and more money every year and we
lose more every year right we we know

120
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,660
what the motives are of all these people
we have conferences were like this is

121
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,510
what you need to do to stop the attacks
in the next year

122
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,330
these numbers are going to just all be
more some of the things that I find

123
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,830
interesting in this year's is that over
70% of the tax there's a secondary

124
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,709
victim and most of the time that means
someone got pwned so thick it on

125
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:38,489
somebody else which to me in my world
you know why you should do this type of

126
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,680
testing or what you should do or where
you should do testing or whether it's in

127
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,109
the development life cycle or whether
it's actual adversarial were or whether

128
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,709
it's just you know modeling something in
your SDLC to make it harder in the

129
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,900
codebase

130
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,350
the excuses nobody's gonna come after us
is ridiculous because they come after

131
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,959
you to get access to your partners and
that's one of those things that most

132
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,489
people don't really fully grasp is that
you're not always going to be the target

133
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:13,130
you might just be the easy way into
somebody else is beautiful it shows that

134
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,459
the time the compromise versus the time
to discover right and easier for on

135
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:23,410
average people are using exploits that
are more than a year old

136
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,819
you know so are are barred entry of
compromising an organization is well we

137
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,579
know that when I get a patch stuff
that's like

138
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:36,089
know a year old so anything within the
last year were most likely follow normal

139
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:43,970
too but the funnier part of this is not
even 25% of the attacks from 2004 to

140
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,339
2014 were even identified that they
happen but more like the idea that we

141
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:54,689
stopped them this is just figuring out
whether they actually got attacked so I

142
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:59,139
i have to pose the question to most
people that when everybody says we're

143
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,160
we're getting worse the attacks are
going up things are breaking more were

144
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,980
not as good I think it's just a
disability thing I think we're sucking

145
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,639
just as hard as we used to but we now
have a couple more tools an environment

146
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:21,829
to be like oh hey we got only and that's
cool if we do something with that common

147
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:26,459
denominators obviously you no point of
sale because they have money

148
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,290
crimeware because it makes money said
the espionage because it makes somebody

149
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:40,329
money for business use because having
providers is really cool web

150
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:44,959
applications because they hold other
stuff that gets to the stuff that gives

151
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,319
you the money is areas because somebody
messed up maybe because they didn't get

152
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,069
enough money

153
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:59,748
licensed or an asset because the jobs
and you can sell it and get my paper

154
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:03,369
cards cuz you know hey that's a little
piece of plastic with money on it

155
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:10,949
there's a pretty easy theme with all of
this so we have is awesome security kind

156
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:18,469
of idea and we try to do things to
defend ourselves so we buy all this

157
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,379
stuff we buy a bunch of stuff to put in
lie and we test all of our stuff some of

158
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,389
us test all of our stuff some of these
tests are so many testing in just have

159
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,419
faith

160
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:35,299
wow sorry that just brought me on
attention to my mind of like I wonder

161
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:40,060
how securities like religion played a
complete that topic

162
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:46,410
yep so you know we tested stuff because
we bought it we want to see if it works

163
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:54,430
right we still get on dollar time we
take the grass is greener game of like

164
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,689
this product at woodstock get to go back
to buying things and then you buy that

165
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,270
thing and then somebody gets around it
and they like but if you had the new

166
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:12,050
energy 2000 version with the added apt
109 defensive behavior just make words

167
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,250
up people who liked about it like Apple
right like you just make something new

168
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,250
and you have to buy it even though it
does nothing cuz you're just like i dont

169
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:25,700
care its new I have to have it reduced
security right we just like Fallout list

170
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,250
marketing game and we buy a bunch of
stuff it snow fall to the people that

171
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,760
are buying stuff like they're actually
doing their job they're doing his best

172
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,819
as they can going I'm not a pen tester I
don't know what these things are but

173
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,070
these people said that blacks that thing
and I'm giving them a million dollars so

174
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:50,320
they probably do their job and other
people like Gardner I mean they paid

175
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,370
them a million dollars to put him in the
right quadrant so they obviously are

176
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,360
doing the right thing I mean whatever
that is grown men to like think the

177
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,490
statistics but it's the best I can do to
try and help this whole battle is to

178
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,260
give you the idea of what happens when
we're doing pen testing and someone

179
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,890
pisses off and makes it hard for us
because if they're making it hard for us

180
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,340
even if you suck even if I'm like the
most retarded kid who comes in last in

181
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:24,679
the Special Olympics at least get
something and I just need to be able to

182
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,790
give something back

183
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:31,510
opposed to just buy anything or put a
new engine but I so I want to try and

184
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,060
share

185
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,770
where it hurts for us and where it's
hard for us to operate and what people

186
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,330
have done whether it's creative for
utilitarian or whatever else to make it

187
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,159
difficult we do tests so the idea is if
there's a monster in your bed scare the

188
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,510
shit out of it like beat it up and if
you have a pen tester who spent testing

189
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:57,930
your environment interact with them as
fully as you can

190
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:05,400
the idea of these like white listed ten
tests or more testing and open fashion

191
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,700
where will we tell you when to stop or
when not to stop that it's the go away

192
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,240
that's that's making us the most inept
fighters in the world you know that I

193
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,070
want to play with you just don't want
reform is that we can't do that if

194
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,960
you're gonna do it that way just don't
do it because you're too low yourself

195
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:33,570
into thinking that you have game and you
have none right the paradigm of this is

196
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,030
that good security programs are built in
and not bolt on if you see your like

197
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:46,120
your security program needs to have a
thing in its in order to stop a main

198
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,699
avenue of attack you need to read
architecture security program the

199
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,090
security program needs to be built in

200
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,949
are ready to know hey we can stop this
or hey we can identify this and some way

201
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,500
shape or form and that whatever tools
were putting in is going to augment the

202
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,370
speed that we have the meantime to
eradication where it's going to increase

203
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,429
the visibility that we have give us more
accuracy in the environment so think

204
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:17,450
that's a capability maturity model that
is above zero or one so we're not to the

205
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,140
ad hoc point when I just relying on our
automated tools were using them for our

206
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:31,010
benefit does that sound crazy maybe it's
early it's early right

207
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,610
so break down some of them external
defenses number one don't talk to

208
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:45,330
strangers totally easy just don't talk
to them you know how many of you

209
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:55,040
automatically block everything from the
emergent journalists why is there any

210
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,020
reason I get internet known bad guys if
you had no labeled criminals would you

211
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,520
just let them you know for sure that
these people are criminals and bad guys

212
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,840
are just so so these types of things
right that automatically gives you

213
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,649
passed that one you're gonna block
ninety percent of all of the bad stuff

214
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,970
that's happening by other people doing
great research to figure out who the bad

215
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,210
guys and Internet are yes every once in
a while you're gonna find a site that is

216
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,980
hosting malware and it's really you know
some customer site but you can deal with

217
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,140
those who want a fashion the bulk of it

218
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,870
block things the emerging statuettes
list and you're gonna be doing a lot of

219
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:47,000
traffic in turn safe and with having
some type of the traffic was sent to its

220
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,050
good I don't really want people to go
out put a whole bunch of honey pots out

221
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,050
there and then say yeah we're doing
security because we have people

222
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,330
attacking or successfully you know honey
pot because you have to be staff to do

223
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,330
that but if you have enough staff and
you have some ability to analyze what's

224
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,780
going out the honeypie

225
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,860
if you put it up and you can use it
starts to get defensive roles puts many

226
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:18,740
bands how many people do that so i guess
im reports can you and then all the

227
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,810
sudden it was hard to ban them sorry no
legitimate traffic needs the board

228
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:32,909
skinny and then everybody girls proven
food boxes at Wrexham right again really

229
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,410
really easy thing putting bands alone

230
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,730
will stop a good 90 to 95 percent of
your point click pen testers that are

231
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,090
out there and we couldn't get anything
you need to whitelist me and then look

232
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:53,590
no do your job or don't suck it's not
that hard to figure out how to do it and

233
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,820
if you can't prove to me that attacker
can do it and you're like well if I had

234
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,040
six months and I could port scan one
port a week

235
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:08,610
ok cool you get six months and in the
long term it to do make your pet

236
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:14,250
hamsters cry like you make them submit
make like I want I want your debrief MTG

237
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,610
tell me again why should pay you cuz it
looks like you didn't do anything that

238
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,439
would be green

239
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,290
clauses in the contract to build if you
get nowhere as you can't show me

240
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,770
anything you provided me know value they
probably won't sign the contract and

241
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,620
then you'll be able to at least find
somebody who's a decent been tested

242
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:43,790
because I'll give you something I know I
can get something like this people do

243
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,040
you want to block an attack you think
the attackers are gonna stop there to be

244
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,870
like 40 minutes we decided to just
forget it

245
00:22:50,870 --> 00:23:01,479
somebody else testing and making sure
blocking actually works

246
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,840
firewalls just don't actually blocked
traffic I mean when what two years ago

247
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,560
when they did the DCP Midstream
renegotiation stuff out of all of the

248
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,090
top 10 firewalls only one of them could
actually stop it from working I mean

249
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:23,120
it's in the Irish Sea you're supposed to
be able to mainstream radio she ate it

250
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,530
was already in state table and then just
randomly let another port through it

251
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:35,928
told me too that's not cool stuff to do
that it needs to be really static

252
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:42,450
doin big data and threaten tell there's
a lot of awesome research going on in

253
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:47,710
this community right now about how to
demystify and debunk the bullshit big

254
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:54,259
data and analytics game and I want so
much more of that to happen because that

255
00:23:54,259 --> 00:24:00,019
game is making a ton of vendors out
there and maybe I'll mention them later

256
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:05,320
that they're full of shit but they are
and you can do all of this stuff

257
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,769
yourself i mean you know there's there's
open IOC there's taxi there's always

258
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:15,559
really awesome rich repositories of
stuff where you can do all of this data

259
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,119
analysis and start correlating some of
these things and stand up here oh no

260
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:24,860
cluster and stack and just dump all of
this information into it and don't get

261
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,918
traffic logs into it and wait for the
big giant red boxes to rain from the sky

262
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,460
and the bad things are here we don't
have to do it at a super fancy level

263
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:41,090
protect all of your Olson right secure
some places that you guys can go if you

264
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,928
haven't done any of these things right
slides up reaching get to start doing

265
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:51,149
them you can start using some honey pots
you know Drupal and Wordpress honey pots

266
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:54,139
I love because if you have Joomla
Wordpress desolate somebody already

267
00:24:54,139 --> 00:25:01,668
owned it and you just get it you can
monitor stuff that's open you know stuff

268
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:04,700
like filibuster fire by or something
like that

269
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,090
test little notes all over your network
and test to make sure I can get from

270
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,240
this part of this part is part of this
part inside outside outside to inside

271
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,259
DMZ to wherever else whatever
classifieds are you have some other zone

272
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,159
and keep constant monitoring of what's
open if magically one day a Newport

273
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,320
opens up and it's not tied to some
change request that you have freaked out

274
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,799
shopping environment down by me totally
go bananas

275
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,418
network engineer in the face is set to
change it stops the fire them on the

276
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,029
spot

277
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:42,390
you'd be amazed how effective some of
those techniques are

278
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:50,550
emerging threats again just block
everything on the list it's legit it

279
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,490
gets updated often it's really really
easy way to lower the overhead that's

280
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:57,630
going into the environment and then
check things check your shirt as

281
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,840
landscape check what's going on what's
being leaked the spider foot project is

282
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,629
really awesome anybody here that are
played at that super cool I mean

283
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,860
literally typing your domain name it go
and it does a billion different checks

284
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,260
of the types of things that we do when
your profile and customer to try and

285
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:22,140
figure out what we have to attack
fishing fishing should be really easy to

286
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,630
defend against and everybody who wants
to complain that the users are our

287
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,440
biggest problem arose in a click on
stuff and bubble bubble but yeah you

288
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,250
should click on stuff it's your job to
protect that circular person telling me

289
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,240
that the user click and that's what
destroyed your whole security program

290
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,490
you sought to build a better program is
really easy just don't don't blame

291
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:55,010
somebody else it's your fault

292
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:03,890
SMPP verify easy one-click if you're in
Microsoft you know one half of two

293
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:11,140
commands if you're on a Linux box use
SPF records always make sure that all of

294
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,040
your bail set filtering solutions are
encrypting all of the protocol types and

295
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,790
decrypting all of the brutal types yes
you have to be able to do some animal

296
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,180
analysis and yes I know that there's
European laws that says you can and

297
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,260
can't do this but you can still take
metadata analysis out of that right

298
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:36,280
say classification super super good if I
have a new site that just got stood up

299
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:41,740
right it should be very easy for us to
analyze how long that site's been online

300
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,370
and I can say without a shadow of a
doubt that magically two moro you're

301
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,989
probably if you're some type of larger
organization you're probably not the

302
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,410
first

303
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,300
person to go to that website it's been
around longer than you mean I know

304
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,169
you're the head through the internet
that knows where all the cool shit is

305
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:05,000
but it's probably been around a little
bit longer than a couple days so as far

306
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,180
as that's concerned monitor your traffic
and don't let people go to sites that

307
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,390
have been marinated on the internet long
enough they could be legit that's funny

308
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:20,400
make it another week we until they get
classified and that's not to say that we

309
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,160
don't try and be classed as we have a
script that submits our fish site every

310
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,170
single one of the entities that are out
there and says hey liberal really flat

311
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,260
oversight or Hayward this classification
versus this classification as we do our

312
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,390
awesome profile we know what sites they
can't get to because we can see oh hey

313
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,830
they're posting from this tech forum and
they did it last month and oh yeah it

314
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,010
doesn't matter that they just drop
registry key is you know the format of

315
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,180
how everything works in their
environment but you know that they're

316
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:52,420
definitely posting so few places by
appropriately we can stay limiting what

317
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,880
the C two hits for decades that we
talked about a little bit use DNS

318
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,550
analysis figure out who's going where
you know there's lots of open source

319
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,100
projects for that there's three projects
for that there's you know the the

320
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,300
different OpenDNS and stuff like that
that will actually actively look for

321
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,700
things and DNS within how long the
site's been there whether the search

322
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,530
valid or not these are things again that
are really really easy to stop attackers

323
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:25,370
very few attackers that I see that are
out in the wild that marinate their

324
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,629
demands for long enough that actually
have the right certificates that have

325
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,260
signed it there SPF records everything
you're in order in the mail is supposed

326
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,950
to get to you so these are these are
really basic types of stops that we can

327
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,910
use you know about verifying just to
send her identity alone to make sure

328
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,510
that the address the MX records are
correct

329
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,020
must attend registry that up to their
like will you can email me back so just

330
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,480
send the fish no reason to set up
another record high cuz its actors are

331
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,040
lazy I mean sentences are lazy

332
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,639
ways to do that stuff again pretty easy
you can block the Spamhaus C-span

333
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,520
accomplice another way to actively and
proactively block these things just

334
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,760
monitor it they get the results it's
very very good data if you're actively

335
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,230
seeking your environment and blocking
these types of things at your mailer you

336
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,660
don't have to worry about all of that
crap coming in you're gonna cut down the

337
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,560
noise in the more we cut down the noise
the more time we have to spend the

338
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,310
things that are really important right
so when people do all this stuff to us

339
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,909
and we're doing the fish with which to
set up a whole environment we have to

340
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,090
set up a search with the sinus surgery
go through you know those seeking the

341
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,040
code of priorities we have to be able to
you know let the serb air date for a

342
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,580
certain amount of time with you

343
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,990
classified into all of these sites and
this is before we even trying to get to

344
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,750
the point of like you know you can has
one hundred million dollars if you could

345
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:58,440
only and then it's a page of Lake give
me your auntie username and password so

346
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,540
it gives you a million dollars annually
ok do that anyway we could train our

347
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:11,230
users what's bad stocks look like we can
use all of the different funny tools me

348
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,040
getting serious and you said you can see
all sorts of stuff to actively train

349
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,139
them to see this is what bad looks like
an increase their knowledge over time so

350
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,770
that instead of becoming the first thing
that pisses you off to the first line of

351
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,620
defense that you have it once you start
treating your users like the first line

352
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:32,790
of defense it's a big big big change in
the environment right you empower them

353
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:37,220
to run out to click on anything that
they want no world and you go you know

354
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:42,420
our internal game is so strong and what
we do is so strong that I want you to

355
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,200
plug on stuff I want to have instead of
half days I want you to have your hat

356
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,560
days go out find an enterprise machine
put everybody in the room

357
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,169
girl

358
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,870
through the internet and click on as
much random bad should as you can you

359
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:02,340
can find and sit in a private network
and they let your security team come in

360
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,050
and be a cool how do you deal with this
person's box like look at the five

361
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,270
hundred toolbars that they have install
how do we make sure that that doesn't

362
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,350
happen again knowing that they're gonna
do that show me a proactive way that

363
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,780
this will not happen I don't care about
what you can break into I wanna see what

364
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,210
users to do when you give them the
opportunity to the worst shit they have

365
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:31,990
and then start building your defenses
internal defense monitor inside versus

366
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:40,430
outside why why why why would you why
would you spend so much money the inside

367
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:46,130
and nothing monitoring the outside or
whatever price you know what why would

368
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,730
you ever it sit there and go we would
have all these ideas on the outside to

369
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:54,330
get to know the people that are skinny
ass all the time just a little bit

370
00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:00,000
probably ignore it and Tyler auditors
yeah we got ideas it's on the outside

371
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,210
and the other day goes ok ideas check
did nothing

372
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,740
you want all of those signatures and all
of those things to into the inside of

373
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:16,020
your environment to be like hey if I had
been alert that goes off and it's on the

374
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:20,279
inside of the network we probably need
to not ignore it you know if you're

375
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:24,390
ignoring her let's say you're just
learning you just need to tune stuff

376
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:31,840
segmentation everybody knows about yeah
we'll tell each other everything is even

377
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,459
though it's really really hard to do

378
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,399
blocking port scans on the inside this
is another one like how many ppl block

379
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:50,010
an alert for portends on the inside like
people that we should missions game on

380
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:56,700
the inside your network other than none
remain friends

381
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:05,100
34,000 ports for no reason it's a
message queue so what you consider that

382
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,129
stuff out and make it really relevant
right looking at net flows looking at

383
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,500
analysis looking to top talkers on the
network

384
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:18,449
trust me if somebody is talking to an
outside entity and its over you know a

385
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:24,540
couple gig you probably have a problem
you know it's not just somebody who's

386
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,290
who's just magically allowing things to
go out you know they're doing their job

387
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:35,330
I X doing gigs of data from the company
probably not real and most of those

388
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,668
really monitor the access to all of the
different cloud services that are out

389
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:43,560
there so you know whether they're going
to a sure whether they're going to you

390
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,790
know blue or whether they're going to
any of the Amazon every other cloud

391
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,109
services out there man who was there

392
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:53,609
get an understanding of what different
types of cloud services you're allowed

393
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:56,839
to use the environment and if something
goes out to one of those other cloud

394
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:03,040
services investigated and shut it down
turn it off all but I was using Azure to

395
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,880
model this thing you're out of process
sorry it's gone but I needed to get the

396
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,930
Dropbox

397
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,379
you know AWS is really great because
they host all topics as data just

398
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:21,230
wondering if you don't have to use the
tools to try and get visibility into bat

399
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,109
instead of the next generation whatever
call firewall that's gonna block 21

400
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:28,049
bullshit attack that they used in the
demo when they were sitting on the floor

401
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,300
and made you go oh you block stuff

402
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,030
configs again not a hard thing to
understand that these detention

403
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,190
suggestions are you working on right not
not the only stop the whole attack chain

404
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,640
let's take this one piece at a time and
start breaking down we need to do

405
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,900
obviously anything else

406
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,260
one of the hardest things I've ever
encountered on a test was a client that

407
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:08,869
had no default route so hardcore that
was the most hardcore thing you plug

408
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:22,290
into a network you get no default route
34 out like ready

409
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,740
conference room where you can do
watching the amount of tears and

410
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:32,229
confusion from the point and click pen
tester people who are sitting in that

411
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:39,569
room and they're just like no network
but its blinking and they're like maybe

412
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:45,730
maybe it doesn't work I don't know is
that this computer earlier works and

413
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,700
they're like maybe my computers

414
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,839
ok put into this did you get an address

415
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:00,710
yes keep looking into this once you get
to know what happened I don't know what

416
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:03,089
I want to go home

417
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:09,710
I lived in letters printed searched and
can't get any address and it just gave

418
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:17,059
me the finger and i dont wanna be here
it's so beautiful

419
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:24,239
now granted doing something like that
but if you could start building

420
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,130
environments when you're building new
environments and thinking about being

421
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:32,380
able to statically route things and
removing all default routing from the

422
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,579
environment

423
00:37:33,579 --> 00:37:38,489
imagine how easy it would be to tune the
IDS into in any of your traffic analysis

424
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:45,440
tools write something has some type of
gratuitous ARP asking where certain

425
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,700
addresses a tractor rolled coast it's
not setup great vision mobile broadcast

426
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:58,680
rapid for anything it's a leasing their
network and super clean it was the

427
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,569
fastest hundred megabit network could
ever been because there was nothing in

428
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:10,299
the way it was really cool and attacking
those types of things especially when

429
00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:16,288
like you send a fish and looking at the
box and you're trying to find other

430
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:19,529
things in the environment and they're
like that's true you can get to these

431
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:24,499
nine boxes and firewalls

432
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:28,419
then you're just like returns from
localhost when you're trying to paint

433
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:36,289
stuff that's wicked confusing maybe my
agents broke so interesting ways to

434
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:39,859
defend like that but there was seriously
one of the hardest thing you've ever

435
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:45,160
probably commit minor changes looking
for those types of things looking at

436
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,799
logs looking at your configs there's
automated an open source tools to do all

437
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:52,490
of this stuff these are things that we
need to bring in

438
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:59,368
in you know crazy you know lead spent a
bunch of money on Tools testers to do

439
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:02,720
this stuff it's not that we can easily
find ourselves that we can radically

440
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:13,439
improve the environment with DNS traffic
on the inside please use please please

441
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,010
don't let the index cards out of your
environment so that I don't have to

442
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,260
listen to all of the people who think
that there are some like I used to it is

443
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,150
can I can get anywhere like sorry you
just punch the kid in a wheelchair

444
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:34,350
you're not impressive these types of
attacks if we use basic functions of

445
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,490
defense so looking at all of those
taking a look at the configs restricting

446
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,740
access making sure that we actually want
our networks and we don't rely on VLANs

447
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,979
because its 1996 or whatever people
think that feelings are supposed to do

448
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:59,099
ridiculous stuff which these things are
for work

449
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:10,839
I love that Keith this is this is a
picture of this office so if you have it

450
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:11,328
works

451
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:17,849
don't let it do anything but be a
workstation it should have server

452
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:23,660
functions are you know if you
administration to the workstation please

453
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:28,868
dial someone run DPP in medicine and
dumped a whole bunch of clear text

454
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:36,339
passwords PPO's you took their lazy a
shortcut to send this account all the

455
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:39,930
machines because you decided you didn't
want to have your sis it mean came

456
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:42,899
together and you're like whatever I'll
just send this account everybody

457
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,220
remember that every single person who
can mount let you know this fall on a

458
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,868
domain controller can decrypt all of
these passwords every single one of your

459
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:57,450
users no matter what their privileges
are so I get that shit out of your GTOs

460
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:03,930
today if you to call someone and make
them change it right now it's not hard

461
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:09,769
to fix categorization of where they can
go to and what they can do

462
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:14,669
whitelisting managing software open it
so hard I users need so much stuff it's

463
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:21,200
a large station is it for work no great
you'll get to have it if they really

464
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,519
really need it to the Executive thing
make a process for approval that goes

465
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,799
through whatever your will is in the
environment whether it's a manager or

466
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:35,788
whether it's their manager whether it's
the boss or whether it's the VP or

467
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:39,579
whatever other random title somebody
gave them so and make at least two

468
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:45,089
levels above them the person above them
in the person above that I signing the

469
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:49,769
risk of why you need to have Flash
installed on your machine or why you

470
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:56,709
need to have some other arbitrary you
know like building or whatever it is OK

471
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,740
don't allow local admin privileges again
but we told everybody that you tell them

472
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:08,098
that but they don't fix it so did you
tell them they're idiots know you

473
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,950
probably just didn't explain why really
needs to happen and what the real impact

474
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,069
to risk is that these things that get
fixed because we don't communicate with

475
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,859
the real level of risk is so it keeps
changing our toll in till somebody gets

476
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:25,029
it let's keep changing the attack
structure it keeps changing where the

477
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,260
parties at the end to make somebody
understand this is why can't happen

478
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,050
right

479
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,910
minimizing our local admin passwords
please don't make it so that I could

480
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,250
take a hash and sprayed all over the
place and login or something else I mean

481
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:49,430
Microsoft Hermes laps for that though
users it's hard to use Windows world

482
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,098
because no severe environments are
actually windows but we can fix these

483
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:59,180
types of things really easily and that's
not to say all the old up accounts that

484
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,240
we have for over latex machines that are
using it because everybody decided to do

485
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,959
it anyway you can still get their right
to randomize the admin password expect

486
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,250
one of your machines to get compromised
by a fish even for doing all this other

487
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,010
cool stuff

488
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,790
expected all the houses that happened on
that machine are gonna get pulled out of

489
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:23,960
it and they're gonna be used everywhere
in your environment that's that's what

490
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,849
attackers are going to do it you can
have all of your defense stuff in place

491
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:33,990
but if step one is only box take all the
ashes on that box and spray them

492
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,598
elsewhere and if you can't see that and
you can't defend against that you have

493
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,339
missed step one of your security program
completely whiffed it you'd be better

494
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:50,330
off removing the firewalls totally just
letting the whole community because

495
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,299
you're not doing your job anyway

496
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,670
firewalls IDS behavior analysis all that
stuff you can do

497
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:03,740
you don't need to spend a million
dollars to do it just to parts of it

498
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,120
obviously literal abilities in the
environment proactively try and find

499
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,009
what the attackers are you go after then
you have to fix it but I know that we

500
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:17,790
have a bunch of legacy boxes that are
windows xp embedded systems are also

501
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,980
their stuff and we found that the vote
exists there we know that we can't fix

502
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,310
it you know dr. a

503
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:31,009
and this thing likes to use his FoxPro
database from the nineties and they're

504
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:35,370
never gonna give it up so little heavy
but they just grabbed a butcher rules

505
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,589
and all of your detective controls
that's a hit anything ever goes this

506
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,670
machine as any of these types of experts
that we know that it's available for

507
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,560
please alert me so that I can go like
told them hey you're under attack today

508
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,450
we can't use it right now but we'll
figure it out let's use it again later

509
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:57,040
right quick ways to do it obviously you
know using laps for removing any of the

510
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,230
GPO stuff whitelist and blacklist and
services in a whitelist and blacklist

511
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,970
things like yes I know we need to do I
need to use job so then at least just

512
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,339
let loose the jobs they need to use
don't just let him use it anywhere and

513
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,830
please don't play the only get a few
signs job because I think dave has like

514
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:23,150
a option where you click to that you
click like four and then click to again

515
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:29,820
you know you got around that control
arguing the devices hardly anything

516
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:34,650
local and then obviously making images
that can withstand the basics of these

517
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,790
types of attacks K

518
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:44,500
keeps its make its review so there
shouldn't have software on them that are

519
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:51,370
not built for survey period if you have
office on one of your servers you fail

520
00:45:51,370 --> 00:46:00,000
if you have any Adobe anything on your
server it's also not a viewer not a

521
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,880
content or it's a server right i mean ok
arrived Dreamweaver because the

522
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,420
webserver Chris haha hope you suck you
have to reverse a web server to

523
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,750
something better but they don't need to
have all this extra bloatware on them

524
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,700
journey to remove that from our bills
because it's just ways that we can

525
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,569
provide jessica Lee Ritenour me hit a
server and we get to those boxes and we

526
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,720
see that there's none server services
running on it to us that the easiest and

527
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,319
quickest way for us to escalate
privileges you don't like the inner so

528
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,030
many of those allowing unquoted attacks
like you guys done any of that before

529
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,930
where if its windows Program Files /

530
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:52,040
like the Tivoli management services
which are now called some other word

531
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,000
because people decided to hate on that
but the way it installs doesn't quote

532
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,200
the actual directory path and because of
those install include the directory path

533
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,740
that means as soon as windows reads you
know left to right and does it want

534
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:13,100
territory time as you make something
called program dat and put it in that

535
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:21,660
path that will run program lucky because
it's forgets the space program and I we

536
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,180
get to run it with all ages

537
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:30,529
super easy privilege escalation in
Windows because the courts in the

538
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:36,220
installer because your vendors didn't
give a shit about security in that test

539
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,509
those things make sure that they were
quick to test that stuff with our

540
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,340
default imaging go we know the default
images from the water that vision great

541
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,770
script out there like the the pen test
monkey scripts that they have a bunch of

542
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,220
Windows escalation

543
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:55,098
privilege checks as well as the one for
Linux rights if you doing this stuff

544
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:57,140
remove everything right away

545
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,029
state leading down your servers they're
going to run better than actually

546
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,530
perform well and they're not going to
have all these ancillary attacks that we

547
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:08,820
can all be privileged through if you
can't get anything on the backs and the

548
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,980
really really important please try using
static or secular any of the other free

549
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,609
services that exists out there the
open-source services at least get some

550
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,819
visibility on the box to see how you
might be able to deploy it you don't

551
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:25,700
have to deploy all these things in a big
way you could deploy with one feature on

552
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,220
instead to try and grow it and changed
over time right to play it out of the

553
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,540
faulty image with it not running and
just doing some analysis so that at the

554
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,410
end of the day if you really need to get
into the box instead of having to

555
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,810
install the stuff you could go over to
the box turn it on and say hey look

556
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,670
you're part of a new eight gig that I'm
in now I want you to start blogging see

557
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,599
things about us having to change
everything on the box and alert the

558
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:57,540
attacker that we're putting logging
tools on the thing common basis and I

559
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,020
sell the stock as basic as it seems
because it really works when people do

560
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,150
this stuff and weapons testing their
environment it's crazy heart like very

561
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,140
often I get to the point of wanting to
grab my backpack climate 40 count and

562
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,650
just put it in somebody's gotta be like
log in log on to the network walking

563
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:19,880
your legacy great I wanna be done with
this job I'm sick of working all day and

564
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:31,130
just go if we can aggravate the testers
to that point we're doing our job

565
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:40,640
just look at the table with things

566
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,690
correlation to talk some of our dad
pulling in different correlated points

567
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,070
there's lots of ways that we can
correlate in environments that don't

568
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,870
cost big giant expensive gobs of money
you can spend them if you have a ton of

569
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:57,500
money to spend on Tori's but I'd say
just start small because you can start

570
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,210
small and some of these things and have
the projects days where you can say I'm

571
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,210
gonna carve out trying this new
defensive technique and see what the

572
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,650
open source tools give you at least you
have a reference point for when the big

573
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,630
guys committed to go it's five million
dollars to deploy this across the whole

574
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,760
environment and your regular that's cool
I could do that would grow with like

575
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,620
seven clicks how do you beat bro with me
clicking a couple times show me start

576
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:28,069
there and then tell me where you add
value for five million dollars more so

577
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:33,450
using that is an IPS to report setting
up on your bros really easy use it in a

578
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,120
small way to deploy a much larger much
more scalable there's people that are

579
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,759
giving talks about stuff like that

580
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,310
using slowed spent his grade point is
free cash but it really isn't tree we

581
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,410
all know that that's why when the IPO
people made like seven million dollars

582
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,850
not free

583
00:50:52,850 --> 00:51:00,810
stack is free and setting up adults that
yes you have to learn how elastic search

584
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,640
works on my god you're gonna have to
read what truly good but there's YouTube

585
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:13,670
videos you can click here and if you use
a plastic surgery you will have to match

586
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:18,920
explode you will have identified myself
magic's plan and then you can start

587
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,900
doing stuff like putting it open I'll
see pretty in taxi putting in all sorts

588
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,250
of the other items that are out there we
can pull

589
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:32,420
and the five small of the most latest
greatest crew were that research

590
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:37,300
everything that's in your stack and logs
and go oh hey look I see this in b5

591
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,130
flying around I don't know why you don't
even have to know where it came from but

592
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,450
if it comes from a match between one of
your input more sets that external in

593
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,859
one of your internal rule sets you know
that it's something to look at your list

594
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,280
are starting on the basis of it right

595
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,580
really really great because you can call
it from OC sources so there's a whole

596
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,500
big important lol to using that and bro
and some other things together we can

597
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:16,320
literally click on the threat Intel
feeds and you can become active you can

598
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,840
just click on the Intel she isn't
putting together and then selling the

599
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:27,260
people for millions of dollars not doing
any research it's true that sucks but

600
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,730
its true so please do it yourself write
a brief look at the crew started the

601
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:42,060
fire guys have been doing the open
source I go slower so glad it's no good

602
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:49,060
stuff and i really appreciate what they
started looking at because I trial go to

603
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,870
all these conferences to find how do I
get to the next point where I get stuck

604
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:00,670
in a pen test what do I have to use to
go farther right cause this technique

605
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,000
got caught no I don't want to burn my
custom si toos ah need to find somebody

606
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,160
else's see to that

607
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,000
public ish in order for me to keep going
through there because these people are

608
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,040
doing a really good job at the gym now
all these people are in the PowerShell

609
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,160
world fathers right everybody knows the
power shows the new next new cool hot

610
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,850
thing to do and Windows right well how
shows awesome and once they get a little

611
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:32,400
bit more pass the how to use PowerShell
the real mechanism for PowerShell to

612
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,880
interact with Windows W my right-wingers
interpretation

613
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:42,250
but it's really cool because it's
actually the most functional logging

614
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:47,380
piece of wall of windows right you can
find anything that's going on and the

615
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:53,210
environment system with fewer shadiest
logging ever you can barely tell what I

616
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,680
mean it's the most cryptic hey here's a
large air see more details

617
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,410
X 1996 be

618
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:09,410
dashed 65 what's that don't know is the
link now where you have to do a search

619
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:15,038
for it so now you have people who are
like a domain controller who elect to

620
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,400
mandatorily doctors to the Internet why
would because I had no idea that there

621
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,010
should be little copy and paste it
that's legitimate claim IDC did you get

622
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,260
to the internet because they were so
crappy that I don't even know what it is

623
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:39,150
the WMI has this beautifully rich system
from walking all of this stuff so I was

624
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,869
looking at PowerShell commands and I was
looking at all the different

625
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:46,510
interpretation that was out there for
really amazing projects like if anybody

626
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:51,270
has looked at all the stuff that the
power switch guys are doing and the

627
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:57,038
shell framework that they made call
empire which is just amazing so they

628
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:03,359
made all this really awesome stuff to be
the you know replacement or augmentation

629
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,880
for Metasploit a lot of ways when it
wasn't being able to see to the right

630
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,650
way other people are too many
environments just to get ready for

631
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:16,640
medicine it's the right thing so now
they use Empire instead let you can look

632
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:22,368
for these basic seven things in Windows
installation and you will find a bolt of

633
00:55:22,369 --> 00:55:26,829
persistence mechanisms that exist in
today's conventional attack right

634
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:32,099
looking true adventures of consumers
consumers any time with their created

635
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:37,839
that mean somebody's making something
its persistent sheen incidence of

636
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,589
namespace and be able to direct traffic
so that somebody is giving you see to

637
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:50,808
you know if you have any type of class 3
last

638
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:57,390
looking at any of the other providers so
anytime in new provider comes into play

639
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,089
you get in a way that there's nothing
that should be doing those things

640
00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:05,860
there's nothing that should be using
those providers engaged services so

641
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:11,850
I think I have it went to exceed it on
the airplane if you look I'm I get home

642
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:16,140
I put like a couple quick PowerShell
scripts for how to sign these things and

643
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:21,629
I'm the most ghetto shitty programmer in
the world so like it writes it to a text

644
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:26,780
file just get the concept of work goes
but if you take any of this stuff

645
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,850
rights to a text file and you run it
started playing with some of these other

646
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,540
frameworks and playing with PowerShell
like installing distributor PowerShell

647
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,990
or using Empire using powerful leader
any of these things if you see that it

648
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,149
write something to the textile it's an
instant elated somebody's doing bad

649
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:50,910
stuff so the stuff that they were doing
with flair which will see the link is

650
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:58,529
making and ideas that hostess you know
there's no program that's it's just good

651
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:03,160
written in order for W my to log things
that happen in W my and send them out to

652
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,430
something else so you can send them out
into your windows event log use that in

653
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:12,430
your sent to start wrapping stuff so
check that stuff out because the the

654
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:17,330
attacker or attackers I mean I know I
was china just because they attack me

655
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:25,960
all the time so you can attack you back
with these don't think so it's not see

656
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:33,480
it it's my network but they're really
really into using powershell W my most

657
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,460
of the apt teams used these types of
attacks so we need to make sure that we

658
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:48,570
have something in line to the fender
reminder that sets the basic stuff

659
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:54,100
our game getting a IR game in order is
really hard as most people don't have

660
00:57:54,100 --> 00:58:01,330
the ability to really truly get a full
incident response process a lot of times

661
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:06,400
it's just one of us who is also the
security person for each one of us is

662
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,120
also the network person the server
person and the security person doing all

663
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,980
of these things at the same time so
getting IRS hard because you don't

664
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,000
really have a team to work with some
making sure that we have some type of

665
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,070
human understanding of what the team is
and moving these people towards a

666
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,130
program where it's like you get the
executives and everybody else to

667
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,330
understand this is like Dr I'm gonna get
big book we're gonna have all these cool

668
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:34,730
little Visio diagram things to say you
know if monkey finds blinky light on

669
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:40,590
computer go to this and then if blinking
light does this thing go to this and if

670
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:45,920
breaking like gets analized as bad
things then go to this and just just

671
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:51,630
starting incident response in that way
is really believe right things that you

672
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:59,360
can do to pull the IR team already has a
great practice in his website of how to

673
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,290
build a strengthened IR everything from
tools to flow charts to what things you

674
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:10,620
can use to why you're going to use them
and a good methodology on how to take

675
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:16,580
some type of attack whether it's a virus
or whether it's a shell or whether it's

676
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,960
somebody running exploits against
something and make a good step by step

677
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,500
method of how to investigate those
things so that you're not just playing

678
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:28,540
the game of all just read images to
their clients all the time that play the

679
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:36,590
game of like we found you you found us
yes we found you ok would you do well

680
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:44,110
we went to the machine to pull it off
intelr good let me re-emerged and put it

681
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:47,430
back on the network and now they're
working again

682
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:53,700
elects Sweden stopping yeah we really
should have seen ok what about other

683
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,859
credits on the machine that I was able
to harvest and they're like what chris

684
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:03,240
Christie know that you're doing I are
interlocked motel near record you guys

685
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:13,000
know so teaching the IR people to use
frameworks used or use any of these

686
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,450
things to go and teach them why you need
to dump ashes right need to dump all the

687
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:21,819
cookies allow web sessions why you need
to teach some kind of look at drive SSD

688
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,370
and everything that comes out and many
cats be able to get an idea of what

689
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,620
opens on the box and go hey after you
did I R when you do this you need to

690
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,680
collect what other collateral damages
pieces that this service actually bring

691
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,740
stuff and then from all these collateral
damage pieces I need to know to shut

692
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:43,549
those down and to continue on the
machine right you need to do that they

693
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,700
did it responds platform there's a
couple that are out there is paid for

694
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:52,129
that you know there's crowds bombs from
crowds right that's trying to do it

695
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:56,010
there's you know all of their like
shayari it's a billion dollars to do it

696
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:56,930
tools

697
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:07,470
myself i I use RTI are in MediaWiki but
are two hours great you have your

698
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:12,359
awesome touch that put together some
things in the Swedish you put together

699
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,450
some awesome tools to make ticketing for
instant response make it a ticketing

700
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:19,980
system and then make sure that your
ticketing system is constantly feeding

701
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,500
education back to the environment to
reuse that in combination with the

702
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,220
MediaWiki so that we can say anytime we
found this attack we found these types

703
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,060
of collateral damage we know these types
of attack works we know how it can

704
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,540
manipulate attacks in a different way
and make them stronger we know how to

705
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,820
defend them in a different way

706
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:41,080
way and that actually gives you repost
information versus oh yeah the incident

707
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:48,819
gone weary image the box click Next and
I know that some of this stuff is boring

708
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:57,370
but men if people actually do these
things when they do these things my life

709
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:05,700
totally sucks it is the sure thing when
people compliment even a tenth of these

710
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,310
things and you really have to work for
it so if you can take something may be

711
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:15,160
out of one of each one of these areas
and try and implemented or try and

712
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,060
suggest those types of things to
implement the customer and the woman I

713
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:23,480
talked about this yesterday people don't
like making good suggestions when you're

714
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,030
on the author inside because they think
it's going to put them out of a job

715
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:32,250
that's sad we should be good enough to
know that we can take all of these

716
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,720
suggestions and go cool nothing really
hard and environment instead of doing

717
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,459
the spencers for a week I'm going to
spend two months because I know that

718
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,830
it's not gonna get us there may be over
time it's gonna go look we have clients

719
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:52,049
that it went from a week to a month to a
year to five years yes

720
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:56,820
test that still going on for the third
year of five years have we gotten

721
01:02:56,820 --> 01:02:57,710
anywhere

722
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:03,050
claimed to get what we want yet not even
close

723
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:10,990
well we just gotta take time

724
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:17,089
I don't have much more you guys have
questions or anything else is it

725
01:03:17,090 --> 01:04:02,710
worthwhile to Leesburg some of the
basics child

726
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:09,070
hey you three

727
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:21,820
you have to monitor those things you're
doing our job to start off the first six

728
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,750
months to a year is much more about
setting up the systems that are gonna

729
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:30,340
give us the ability to get the things
that we need when we need them so

730
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:34,760
monitoring the environment monitoring
how poor change in the environment what

731
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,680
service go online and offline start
defining what their processes for

732
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,910
building servers setting up all of our
automated docent pieces that were

733
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:46,620
constantly monitoring every single thing
that they put the internet every

734
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:52,339
document metadata analyzed every time
something to open a press release any

735
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:57,340
time we start to see this one
specifically which I'm sure they'll

736
01:04:57,340 --> 01:05:02,530
listen to talk to their trying to figure
out where to go next

737
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:08,270
give them a piece of that for this right
a year ago there is a press release that

738
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:12,680
they bought a new company they absorb
the company so instantly I was like

739
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:18,529
sweets attacked the ship the press
release came out we owned every single

740
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:23,400
thing that company and then just sitting
there waiting and waiting

741
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,240
addresses that we go from their internal
network to start the board right leg in

742
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,169
the book starts taking over parts of
their network and you start getting

743
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:33,740
logins from some of their machines we
see their eighties get tied together

744
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:39,779
with a cool overheated we're not gonna
be in this is the way to do it is really

745
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:40,650
smart thing to do

746
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:45,610
system analysis before they bring things
in bringing in one service at a time so

747
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:49,040
we had to start studying executables to
know that they were going to run this

748
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:54,570
executable to analyze what it does hold
me to make you know kids that were not

749
01:05:54,570 --> 01:06:01,100
interactive and stuff like that so it's
hard but it's really really exciting

750
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,620
really rewarding because you have a
couple of things going on

751
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:09,250
on and the second i get a text message
or an email from one of our systems

752
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,470
that's like hey there's a new thing
online as a shitty version of Drupal

753
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:23,270
unlike you can talk to someone then it's
hitting everybody by the time I get to

754
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:27,170
my computer sometimes they have now made
it to the next level of challenge that

755
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:30,310
we're trying to get to and we're
reaching all of our systems that are

756
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:34,730
watching for everything to see what the
next opportunity is so it's not like

757
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:37,470
you're sitting there staring at a screen
for three years right you set up the

758
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,240
automation you set up your systems and
you

759
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:53,859
week for the budget and it's fun it's a
Christmas every time you get even better

760
01:06:53,860 --> 01:07:07,070
characters it's basically and you run
into you may achieve much better results

761
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:18,990
using open source security tools does
not yet sorry next week is so critical

762
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:28,180
and sold out but people finding
qualified people who care is a challenge

763
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:34,629
of such a long time so can you say
something about what the culture is like

764
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:41,910
in the teams that do these things that
fuck with your game because that's my

765
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,830
question what's the

766
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:48,590
what do they do write in the culture the
thing that I've found through the

767
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:53,710
multiple iterations of testing like this
is that they are not people that are

768
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:57,030
afraid of the fight because they got
into the fight once and realize that

769
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:00,780
they survived and then after they got
into the fight and realize that they

770
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:05,360
survive they figured out the next time
that they survived better and more

771
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:10,710
efficiently and more effectively by
working together and by the force to

772
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:14,440
fifty sixty years of doing stuff like
this though the ones that are talking

773
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,660
shit in the shell alike haha I got you
picking up the phone

774
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:24,849
one of my favorite stories of any of
that I had a CSIRO call me and say he

775
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:29,040
might either in the office this weekend
freaking out patching stuff standing up

776
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,939
all these products and services also
their stuff why did something happen

777
01:08:33,939 --> 01:08:38,549
they will again so they saw that
Christians was looking for a restaurant

778
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:42,100
in our city and they just figured you
guys were out tests they are so they're

779
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:46,400
losing their shit like battling the
whole environment down and I was like

780
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,620
that's awesome and I was like I think
he's doing his family on vacation he's

781
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,519
like yeah I'm not gonna tell them

782
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:58,990
where I have blue teams that are on the
phone and they're like really do this

783
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:15,568
week a star but we know it's you me you
know the people who take the adversary

784
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:20,990
game and use it as something that unites
them and makes them interested in their

785
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:26,000
job and not like got hacked quick get on
LinkedIn and put my resume out you know

786
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,390
if if you really in defender then you
get fired up about the fight you look

787
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:40,089
you want to do you want people to come
attack so really the biggest thing that

788
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:45,549
I find in any of those teams as the
people that welcomed the authors and

789
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:49,630
wanted anyone to see the office they
wanna see how it works and they will

790
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:57,890
make sure I thank you guys so much I
appreciate it happy to chat about any of

791
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,900
this stuff first time of year so thank
