1
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:07,020
so this stars are second day of
buchanan's we have come a long way and

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,430
I'm not talking about yesterday's party
for those who when they're happy to see

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:18,990
so many people away today as well so yes
we have gone a long way and it will

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,229
every person industry has a lot of
problems and we have been doing a lot of

5
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,420
things over the last couple of years
last couple of decades to arrange the

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,339
privacy and information security but
still a couple of problems remain there

7
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:39,059
are still issues need to be fixing and a
lot of things to make the roads safer

8
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,769
place they've has a lot of years of
experience in

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:51,170
helping secure and and changing the way
information security landscape is today

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,020
and he's a founder of trusted say he is
one of the writers of them it explodes

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:02,780
book he is the creator of the social
engineering toolkit and he's contributor

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:09,160
and owner actually or a creator of
artillery we are happy we are very happy

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,920
to have them here today because this one
of thirty years that Groupon is not over

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,610
I think we've become so this is one of
the only occasions we can have their

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:28,760
here thank you dave is yours thanks very
much appreciated

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,740
well good morning everybody in
appreciate you coming out here I'm sure

17
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,210
everybody was not drinking last night or
having any type of fun so everyone see

18
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,240
brilliant is ready for my my talk today
but pleasure being out here

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,000
interesting enough my family lineage my
family's all from Belgium so I sent you

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,110
the first time I've been able to come
out here so it's going to need to see a

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,140
lot of my relatives and things like that
we're at but we got in late last

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,980
yesterday so I think the party too hard
I think the bed at like ten o'clock or

23
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,470
something like that I'm getting old just
a quick background myself kind of come

24
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,160
through a long ways and information
security said you know I start off on

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,859
the military side and the military
intelligence I'd do more crypto type

26
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,350
type analysis and breaking crypto and
and those types of things and then got

27
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,910
into the private sector and working
there for a number of years before she

28
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,780
got to do a lot of things in the media I
testified in front of Congress choice

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,090
and if you know anything about us-
politics that's really messed up so I

30
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,370
probably never ever do the whole
congressman again and not as good but

31
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,390
now we did a lot of good stuff on there
but my my passions always been breaking

32
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,029
things in figuring out how to fix things
and that's kind of where a lot of the

33
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,950
tools that have written the book so I
rates all those things kinda spawned

34
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,859
from and today I'll show you a new
version of the social engineering

35
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,030
toolkit that I just wrote on the
airplane here on that works on Windows

36
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,170
10 and everything else which is gonna be
great format from an exploitation back

37
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,450
there but you know everything that I do
is really trying to make the industry

38
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,640
better and in kind of going from there
also started a conference call Derby

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,950
Conn which I'm really glad that it
didn't conflict it's great to be here in

40
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,208
a no-win has been trying to get me here
for a number of years and it's always

41
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,360
been kind of hard so you can book about
folks with some Derby concerts it's

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,280
always great to see but really you know
I started to companies about four years

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
ago

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,850
and then going well and we can focus on
the information security side if you

45
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,069
look at security today you know it for
me it's been interesting because you

46
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,390
look at that kinda when I started and
you know I came in at a really young age

47
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:36,559
the military said remember doing DEFCON
and Alexis Park you know in 1999 and you

48
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,819
know one of those things where you know
it's kind of a tight-knit community in

49
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,708
Rakhine of brainstorming and figuring
things out but it was really really

50
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,410
small and you didn't have dedicated
groups to security in half folks you

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,530
know focusing on security and as far as
organizations go when you see a lot of

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,420
things start to change and you know I
was just there because there was a a

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,320
keynote panel that had you know
nickerson and it's going to be noted

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,310
here a couple of years ago to me as good
as I think here and another phenomenal

55
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,910
person in Katy and allow the other folks
and there's a big debate on kind of

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,829
where InfoSec was headed to in and
that's what we're talking about today

57
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,120
looking at where we're at right now some
of the ways that we're seeing a lot of

58
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,728
these things and ultimately how do we
get better and can improve on what we've

59
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:22,229
done is we have accomplished a lot now
it's interesting this year's Emmy follow

60
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:28,909
Mr robot wants to show mister it's
actually interesting to see how portray

61
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,250
a how hackers are kind of her train and
it's it's really interesting because

62
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,660
it's it's really miserable as a result
of the accurate portrayal of a kind of

63
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,750
the hacker mindset and right that was
really interesting as one of the

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,990
episodes episode 344 you know Elliott
the guy that's the main actor in the TV

65
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,300
show you know talks about his chances
get into something that never happened

66
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,400
before I have to research when I'm going
after I have to figure out an attack

67
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,780
vector its to get in I think they're
trying to break into a prison in soyuz

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,799
able to find a bug in police you know
the police vehicle and through bluetooth

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,270
whatever happened to their but it's
going to be interesting to see how were

70
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,150
being portrayed now you know as far as
having to do research and i cant hack

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,770
anything or break anything

72
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,969
require some sort of of knowledge as an
attacker and some skill level to

73
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,840
actually go after we're gonna be
targeting and that's kind of what we're

74
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,679
seeing is being kinda changing as we're
industries refocusing a lot and

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,419
automation in automating hacking and
automating defenses and detecting

76
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:28,520
hackers in an automated fashion or as
you know in in in all venture out in

77
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,320
reality

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,940
a lot different than that was also the
call is another result of five but

79
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,900
hacking into steel mountain if I they
are social engineering a lady in there

80
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,349
actually using the social engineer its
ok which I wrote actually hack into

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,450
steel mounting calls on member to see my
told you know being used in a TV show is

82
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,750
kinda need but hey whatever they're
actually a really old version and future

83
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,030
isn't even in the new version the same
thing but so you know if you look at

84
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,320
that kind of history right you know the
the times at the types of security we've

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,700
had out there we've now moved to more
interconnected of everything you know

86
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,020
the Internet of Things in focusing on
having everything connected to us real

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,969
time which is phenomenal grade from a
technology perspective and security is

88
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,840
never something that should stop or be
in the way of technology which is where

89
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,909
I think a lot of us have a really pretty
focused on if you look at kind of the

90
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,810
old methods of of protection you know
our goal was to kind of stop things a

91
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,290
little bit and see if it could you know
be secure for those with for us to to

92
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,690
get into things and really we can't do
that anymore technology moves so fast

93
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,510
that it's almost impossible to stop a
lot of the the methods that we see today

94
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:41,490
for technology to advance and I was
looking at at the ratio to security

95
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,490
folks tights he means anybody I don't
know if it's the same in the United

96
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,170
States is everywhere else but you know I
mean I T people generally have to a

97
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,140
security person you know it's usually
you know 200 300 you folks that one

98
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,400
security person or maybe a half a
security person or maybe you have a few

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,919
folks dedicated security but most of the
time the ratio to security 290 or the

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,820
ratio to security to you actually secure
their organizations are significantly

101
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,940
lower than what you actually need to do
that's interesting and so you look at at

102
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,940
packing today and what interests me is
the types of methods that we see on the

103
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,260
bridges in me CNN how they're actually
going after it on me know when you look

104
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,870
at the media you have certain companies
that that that kind of embellish I guess

105
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,840
how hackers are breaking into
corporations and it's in to make it seem

106
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,799
like it's a highly sophisticated type of
attack and look at Stony for example a

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,780
good looks like you know the type of
malware that was written for Sony look

108
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,460
like something that a nine year old
could have written and you know

109
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,260
something that was really basic I'm you
know

110
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,730
is like nine different binary droppers
and using commercial tools to kind of

111
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,800
mix into it as I I was a hack job to
destroy company and those the types of

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,010
techniques that we see they're not
terribly sophisticated in some cases

113
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,050
they are but in most cases than 99
percent of breaches you see out there

114
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,420
really result in things that are just
trivial for attackers get into and so

115
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,380
right now we have a perception that
hackers are awesome in all hackers are

116
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,170
breaking into computer systems and
they're using 0 days and all this other

117
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,250
stuff and so you have companies focusing
on these types of techniques to try to

118
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,930
protect themselves when you know they're
using basic passwords in not passing the

119
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,440
systems and everything else we have a
major gap right now and if you look at

120
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,840
ninety percent of of of the bridges out
there is little resigns leaving the

121
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,080
front door open

122
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,270
you know i mean i i Manchester I
breaking accompanies every single day

123
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,729
and nineteen ninety percent of time the
way that I get into somethin stupid

124
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,830
right

125
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,130
default password or missing patch or
somebody click the link that they

126
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,400
shouldn't have under all simple
techniques of getting into an

127
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,179
organization I camera last time I had to
burn as irritated get into a company

128
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,020
having a good company that has no good
security practices 99% uptime is

129
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,360
something basic and stupid that gets me
into a company and you know the the fact

130
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,740
is that we're focusing on apt prevention
tools and all this other stuff when are

131
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,370
far and password is something we can
ridiculous that makes it easy to get

132
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,070
into we are just doing a test for a
company recently and you know mean

133
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,580
website first thing we tested in the
input fields in the search field was

134
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,320
injection on the web application is
running as an elevated account which

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,060
gave us access to the inside now working
in for mary compromise the move

136
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,420
laterally and got access to the rest of
the environment like basic basic stuff

137
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,360
you know stuff that we've been knowing
for ten or fifteen years that our

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,430
problems and those are the issues that
we still experience today my favorite

139
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,150
topic is end users and I'll show you an
example of when the techniques that I

140
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,130
really like to rely upon now that's a
new job at the method will talk about

141
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,060
the second before me and users are by
far the easiest way still right and I

142
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,069
talked about this a lot of other talks
before in the past and it's nothing new

143
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,610
but I mean if you just spend 15 20 30
minutes

144
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,440
developing something that's somewhat
believable someone is going to click it

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,380
and I don't care of one person clicks
ordered five people click it or six

146
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,610
people like it I just care that I get
one person to open up some nineties that

147
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,720
I can get access the rest of the
infrastructure that's kind of where

148
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,060
we're at right now I mean our entire
security premise is based off of one

149
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,170
user one using the company can
completely making a complete down from

150
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,120
cataclysmic effect of an entire
organization and to me that's a problem

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,190
I mean if if one user can click a link

152
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,340
a compromise the machine goes undetected
which going undetected very trivial you

153
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,390
know that that's what our security
premise is based off of and that's where

154
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,050
most egregious happen and so you saw
that you know if you look at kind of the

155
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,750
history of of emphasis great you saw all
of these breaches happen and you saw all

156
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,040
of these things happen so we develop you
know cyber security team which is

157
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,469
supposed to combat these types of
threats the problem is that cyber

158
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,460
security teams are built off of you know
existing legacy you know since the

159
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,650
pastor or whatever

160
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,949
where you have a lot of issues that that
are really been out there for a number

161
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,670
of years and we're supposed to fixing
clean up all of the issues that

162
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,329
companies have done in the past and
machine example here in the news for an

163
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:06,370
assault on your machine but will show
you really quick

164
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:17,070
both of a little bit crazy that so one
of the main methods that I typically do

165
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,920
to get access to the company's always
spend probably half hour 45 minutes

166
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,110
researching 122 people inside of a
company and usually you know I can do

167
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,990
more than that but when two people is
usually easier than as an industry right

168
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,230
now you know when we do social
engineering everything all we want to do

169
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,160
sampling of our our infrastructure right
we want you to know see how many people

170
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,850
will click a link that you can track
statistics that's not a real world

171
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,380
example of of what an attacker's going
to do and ultimately when I look at an

172
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,610
attack I try to find one or two people
that I think are decent in the company

173
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,210
that may have elevated rights or may
have no access to systems that I need

174
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,260
access to what I do is I just go to
LinkedIn or go to the social media sites

175
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,850
I'll take a look at them and I just been
about a half hour 45 minutes kind of

176
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,620
looking at them what they do and it
sounds kinda stalkerish creepy but it

177
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,089
doesn't work sometimes gets released
operation where to find that weird

178
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,000
things about him that I certainly
thought you know trying to figure this

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,550
out but in most cases what I usually do
is is all spent about you know half hour

180
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,849
on an individual and then I'll craft an
email upper something that looks

181
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,490
believable a website or whatever into
being and I develop my whole pretext or

182
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,110
my attack off of somebody based off of
that and what I enjoy about that is you

183
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,970
know like I used to do a lot of XP
research and you know I haven't done

184
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,000
that as much over the past year to and
what's fun about this is it's like

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,320
almost a new zero day every single time
you know when you attack a human you're

186
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,070
attacking a flaw in them are you trying
to make them believe something and so

187
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,140
it's kind of fun to create something
that's completely ridiculous that makes

188
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,150
no sense whatsoever but it does to them
in so a lot of cases you know you can do

189
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:53,540
things that that our normal business
operations like hey you know you have to

190
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,520
do this based on you know company policy
or whatever but a lot of times I try to

191
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,130
impact them in ways that are are
personal to them and so you know a lot

192
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,320
of times you know a website that they go
to the visit and I'll send an email to

193
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,570
comment on the phone phone calls the
best phone calls it the easiest way

194
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,330
because you can establish rapport very
quickly and in most of us in the

195
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,400
security field are kind of the nervous
antisocial type

196
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,050
but I really enjoy just picking up the
phone calling somebody and saying hey

197
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,680
this is so and so can you go to the
sinful this out right away because we

198
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,589
need is for some sort of reason and it's
usually really fast and quick and it

199
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,230
makes it you know that that level of
rapport as always establish immediately

200
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,890
based off just a phone call me if you
can

201
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,350
couple like phone spoofing or something
that on top of it even easier you know

202
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,560
if you come from a trusted number
somewhere inside of a company makes it

203
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,800
even better so the solution you're
talking about a option one and I'll be

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,060
releasing this new version later today
but this is just an below that's about

205
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,739
10 stan is there she put in some
additional protections are impartial

206
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,320
injection which is one of the main
methods I use for exploitation you not

207
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,770
familiar with partial injection you know
a lot of folks went through Lake

208
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:11,829
application whitelisting and a bit nines
and things like that right in so

209
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,910
dropping you know binary droppers is
kind of a way of the past my opinion I

210
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,579
haven't actually dropped a pioneer in a
system probably for a few years and I

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,460
want my favorite this is what we call
partial injection which you know it's

212
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,140
great with Windows XP end of life is now
you're guaranteed a reliable

213
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,080
exploitation method on Windows so what
you can do with PowerShell you can

214
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,310
directly in Jax show code into memory
without ever touching disc which is

215
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,060
phenomenal right so you can put whatever
you want in memory and spray whatever

216
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,479
you want to memory all through power
show on allows you to get real-time and

217
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,590
traditionally the way that I used to do
that is through what was called a Java

218
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,800
applet Mehsud and so I we know that job
is installed on a lot of machines and

219
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,969
you have the ability to exploit that but
in a lot of cases if you don't know

220
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,360
jobs in Saudi machine is also another
off you agree methods are out there

221
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,900
available and I just over here actually
brought me into one of which are called

222
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,840
HTH attacks which is one of the new
method that's available inside a set and

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,940
so what happens when you run this this
this attack is it'll injector PowerShell

224
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,800
directly onto the desk at our shoot into
memory and it gives your shell whatever

225
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,780
you want to be on the network and then
you have full access to the computer and

226
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,110
it bypasses or circumvent I guess
execution restriction policies which

227
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,850
really isn't much you know that's not
really a security mechanism but it

228
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,020
allows you to basically have a one liner
that that allows you to compromise a

229
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,730
system

230
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,540
without having to touch this website
attack vectors number two and a new

231
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,709
method is number eight which is the 88
Ahmed and others a lot of good ones out

232
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:43,779
there one of my favorites is actually
what was called the web jacking message

233
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,199
which basically makes you believe that
the certain side is there and it takes

234
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,349
takes advantage of what you consider
like the Harbor attack with a number of

235
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,699
different method I hear that you can use
I don't typically run exploits anymore

236
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,880
you don't really need to export machine
anymore because for me exploits you know

237
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,529
you have to profile the machine at the
mission the versions correcting the

238
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,180
operating systems corrected to make sure
that everything perfect when you going

239
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,790
to launch an attack and it takes a lot
of time I mean if you have that time is

240
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,290
great if you want to focus on targeting
individual user him come to your your

241
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,870
site first encounter profile the browser
and see what versions are using then

242
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,970
from there you know selectively grab an
exploit that's fine but in most cases I

243
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,829
don't ever really typically run exploits
anymore because there are so many things

244
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:29,219
available inside of Windows anyway you
don't have to actually explains just

245
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,620
refusing to do to get remote code
execution you don't really need to run a

246
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,649
specific explain and so head over eight
which is the ACA attack method and then

247
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:46,370
it all my IP address

248
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,100
system IP address in your book and then
what port of the GPS from a display

249
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,650
gonna take a second is going to generate
the show code it's going to wrap it

250
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,199
around in two parts of the partial
injection techniques in encoded sinocast

251
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,480
Unicode in the base 64 encoded

252
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,660
website now I was doing a pretext you
know I would do something you know bill

253
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,100
either build my own website or use you
know Amazon or something or you know

254
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,669
whatever I want to do in order to use my
pretext to get around something but it

255
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,040
will go on the website and injected them
into the new method and it launches an

256
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,609
increase everything for you

257
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:32,959
launches water listener and will be
ready to go if you didn't know this by

258
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,059
the way the way the displacement server
handler works is the first stages

259
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,590
there's what's called a first date in
second stage four stages the the basic

260
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,178
stage that is kind of the the show and
the second stage is what you know is

261
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,990
where the rest of your information that
didn't know this or not the reverse HCPs

262
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,160
handler actually goes on polls a banner
during which if you have any type of web

263
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,010
content filtering software like you know
anything that stops binaries middle

264
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,100
actually gone block that you get around
that really quick if you want by typing

265
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:11,500
and we do set enable stage encoding the
true that actually mingles the second

266
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,429
stage into its called shekana guy named
which is an old encoding platform which

267
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,200
gets picked up by anniversary but since
it's over the wire it doesn't get picked

268
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,030
up anything and if you're trying to get
around Palo Alto's or things like that

269
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,250
and also works very well with you just
hit enables me to come true it means a

270
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,800
second stage completely over the wire
and you're nothing to worry about

271
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:40,340
so I'm gonna run that and so when you
gonna run this on a Windows machine

272
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:52,809
I go and use a new edge browser which is
also secure a career in orders will go

273
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,158
to this this web site i like reading in
just a second

274
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:59,210
well happening in in here's the thing
you're going to see them going to have

275
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,700
to hit open on something that launches
right arm in older versions of Windows

276
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,190
like Windows 8 Windows 7 it actually
pops up and says do you trust Microsoft

277
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,830
oh yeah trust Microsoft Windows 10 news
actually additional step yet to hit run

278
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,720
but what I usually do as I just build
these these these clips that our user

279
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,120
has to go through intimate pretexts only
hey just you know when you visit this

280
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,299
site we need to verify your computer so
make sure you hit run or whatever and

281
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:33,340
open it up and you trust Microsoft of
course you do so good as website website

282
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,029
itself is going to run a security scan
really quick on the on the file itself

283
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:45,580
and then it's gonna run you get a little
pop up here and it goes in execute the

284
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,100
odd little part of the connection but
once you're there could you to redirect

285
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,668
back to legitimate site itself or back
here your game interpersonal and it

286
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:00,210
works perfectly fine on Windows 10 and
you don't have any such as this which is

287
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,730
great that's the new method inside a
stab at the new version is now supports

288
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,880
Windows 10 which the PowerShell
injection technique any memory injection

289
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,179
works perfectly fine what was
interesting is that with 64 bit

290
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,000
platforms there's there's an interesting
fact we're like if you're trying to

291
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,740
compromise a 32 bit system is a system
you need to you know have independent

292
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,299
show code for 64 bit platforms or 32 bit
platforms so what I did as I i figure

293
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,830
out a way to you automatically detect if
you're in a 64 bit or 32 bit platform

294
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,230
with in PowerShell and automatic
downgrade the process to a 32 bit

295
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,309
process and the name Jack need of 32 but
she'll go into memory I'm so allows you

296
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:44,510
to basically compromise is 64 bit or 32
bit platform natively without having to

297
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,299
use different pieces of shelter which is
awesome so it allows you to just no one

298
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:50,500
command line string args

299
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,570
by the way if you're interested in like
if you ever get anything that's like

300
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:14,610
remote command execution of its owner
here will be under so just as this

301
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,689
community here

302
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:24,020
notice that is just a string here is
launching community see you at the

303
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,650
command and in PowerShell the windows
hidden code of command and this command

304
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:34,250
here is just it's just cast Unicode in
the base 64 encoded you if you have

305
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,910
anything that you can copy and paste
into your or run a command on you can

306
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,780
get partial injection natively in just a
few pasted into that window in executing

307
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,440
is your shell so you don't have to drop
binaries it works really well with you

308
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,130
used to display its peers exact right is
execuse rough because it actually starts

309
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,450
a service and creates a biography of
binary but he s exec underscore commands

310
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,650
allows you to specify our host which
allows you to spray multiple the whole

311
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,100
network just paste that command line and
then just get shells you know coming

312
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,340
back to you without having any test disc
which is really nice so a lot of really

313
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,659
cool ways of getting around most of the
stuff that's out there and get yourself

314
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:21,710
so the computer now the job Apple method
still pretty successful outcomes will do

315
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,680
we're going after an individual

316
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,630
multiple redundancies and failed backs
so I'll usually do is all run the Java

317
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,600
applet first in Asia coaching
certificate for that so usually have a

318
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,219
company Mike verified verified secure
whatever and then if that fails it it

319
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,560
falls back to the HTML and if that fails
it falls back to harvesting credentials

320
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,700
they can hopefully hop on certain they
could be pnr RWAs think that a lot of

321
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,330
different ways of getting around it but
in that case you know one user is the

322
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,840
whole downfall of an entire organization
because not that allows me now it's a

323
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,490
compromise a system and then move
laterally to the rest the environments

324
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,450
which is really important

325
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,750
and that's what you see right you mean
you see one person become compromised or

326
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,289
a one server become compromised or
something else and there's enough

327
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:12,070
information on that system that allows
me to then kind of piggy back and move

328
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,580
laterally into a lot of other systems
and that's kind of our model secure

329
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,019
enough to compromise when Windows
machine or one Linux machine that allows

330
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,559
us to get access to multiple other
machines which is a very bad state and

331
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,080
so you know the history of cybersecurity
what we do and what we're taught to do

332
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,000
you know is start to build a castle
right we build a castle has archers and

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,610
draw bridges and everything else in
there and then we build these heavily

334
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,600
fortified walls with firewalls and
everything else could protect hackers

335
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,889
from from coming on the inside and
that's a great mentality if we didn't

336
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:46,979
have like mobile devices and BYOD and
everything else the source of it as an

337
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,580
obvious enemy of cloud movements and IOT
and everything else that starts to

338
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,470
happen right now are canceled mentality
is is basically nothing were were

339
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,429
completely wide open are the drawbridge
is down and everybody's Laden out and

340
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:02,090
now we're supposed to protect everything
right and so it's interesting and

341
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,779
security where we've more from from that
castle mentality to hey we're allowing

342
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:11,299
everything on any given time we have to
figure out a way to make that work and

343
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:16,570
security it's a really hard position to
to work off work on and then the problem

344
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,279
is is that such a new industry that we
don't have the town yet I mean if

345
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,909
they're very very new industry mean I
would see over the past 10 years it's

346
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,210
grown three thousand percent I mean if
you know what you went from DEFCON in

347
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:35,070
1999 or 2000 and had two hundred people
there to DEFCON which now has 25,000

348
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,389
people that's a pretty big statistic
right so we now have folks dedicated to

349
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:42,469
it and I we don't have a lot of town out
there to pull from and so companies I

350
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,899
struggle with hey who I hire hire hire
how do I build at Tallinn up to build

351
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:50,418
in-house forces outside insulting and
now you know everybody starts like oh

352
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:54,090
hey I need to hire for information
security because it's important and we

353
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,809
start hiring for information security we
start seeing a lot of breaches happen

354
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,779
where you can weaponize attacks we can
go after companies in cause financial

355
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,000
loss you can cause intellectual property
theft in 'cause credit card bridges

356
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
whatever it is it's a man who starts to
freak out right there like a

357
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,799
this isn't good we need to figure out a
way to stop this and prevented and so

358
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,210
now you're that person as opposed to
stopping for rent all this and yet you

359
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:19,110
know you're supposed to be in meetings
you know deal with you know having to

360
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,258
secure every single piece of technology
and infrastructure you now are sitting

361
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:26,279
in in in countless meetings of higher
gonna protect this infrastructure and

362
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:30,389
that Architektur architecture and I are
overloaded environment and I'm from that

363
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:34,658
environment I came from where I was a
chief security officer for a really big

364
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,289
fortune 1000 company in the United
States and so you know you're you're in

365
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,440
the cyclical factors for you you're
supposed to put out every fire you

366
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,179
possibly can and you don't have a town
that you need or you don't have the

367
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,440
people you need are you do have the
people you're part of that that type of

368
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,759
program it's very difficult to keep
under control and the company literally

369
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,370
just throw money as you like he hears
$1,000,000 $2,000,000 here's three

370
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,529
million dollars here's ten million
dollars rate do what you can to protect

371
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:10,549
our organization and we created a really
weird industry because we went from like

372
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:13,970
the days of nyquil hey we're gonna have
an embarrassing stuff like that that's

373
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,940
cool to rebirth the whole industry
around technology and what happened was

374
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,450
we have you know fifteen twenty years of
our thirty forty years of neglecting

375
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,000
security within organisations flat
network architectures you have all these

376
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,080
legacy systems do you have to support in
all these different areas in now you

377
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,990
know opening up our Castleman town in
long everybody in and now we have all

378
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,480
this money so what we do with all this
money well normally what we would

379
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,009
normally do is try to build a security
program because now we have the

380
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:47,789
visibility of the companies say hey we
have to build a structure around our

381
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:52,049
program but now we have all this money
we have to spend this money so we don't

382
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:55,950
have enough people right but when I can
be able to hire people for some reason

383
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,620
it's weird like we have enough money but
we can't hire people so we're gonna buy

384
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,449
technology arena by technology to solve
our problem because technology is gonna

385
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,389
fix all the issues that we've been
neglecting for fifty years or for twenty

386
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:12,139
years at least and so we're going by
these products and does he know what

387
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:18,199
happens when you buy products we don't
have enough people just gonna sit there

388
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,860
and what's great is like a we've had
this pic

389
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,969
firewall you mean we moved in a sec
which is great but we need to get

390
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:31,549
NextGen so we're going by this Palo Alto
right does Paula lot is gonna save us in

391
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:35,049
Palo Alto has great rule importer from
hearsay is what we do is we take twenty

392
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:40,840
years of shit i mean imported into Palo
Alto is having its gonna fix it right

393
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,790
now that's our security we have twenty
years of crap and then we just put ten

394
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,120
years of crap into a brand new system
that we didn't do you know because it's

395
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,270
too hard to redesign architecture it's
too hard to say hey Marseilles lotion be

396
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,629
talking to our marketing folks are
marketing folks talking R&D and R&D

397
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,040
shimmy talking to our servers are too
hard to do now segmentation is going to

398
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,600
pop all that stuff in there and it's
gonna hopefully be good and by the way

399
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,699
our guys are experts at a disease now
now need to be experts in Palo Alto

400
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,679
Center Rd overloaded and I did put a
whole new system infrastructure I'm sure

401
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,110
that programs into a great but now we
got this policonomics find out I'm going

402
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,360
running we we down the network for like
five days and we had a whole bunch of

403
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,840
things break for fine now now we're
gonna go buy some apt prevention tool

404
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,549
right and so now that Palo Alto's over
here now are focusing on his apt

405
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:34,418
prevention so we also have deal P you're
going to do to you also have this new

406
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:38,059
NextGen you know you know em points off
our stuff that we need to figure out as

407
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:42,549
antivirus is dying but we don't have
people so I just did the Opie kind of

408
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:45,139
salty that over here and I'll start
working on this now not be that over

409
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,290
here and I'll start working on this now
but we spent all this money in our

410
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,290
server better

411
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,928
cracks me up as we do Penn tests and
they have these do this you know you you

412
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:59,780
look at their server racks and you see
all the big-name brands and they're

413
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,190
right you got your awesome sim you got
you know you got your fire eyes and you

414
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,960
got all this other stuff and it's all
sitting there doing wonderful magic for

415
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,400
you right now we're going to break in
and we notice and technologies they're

416
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,230
like you got access to everything like
aid will do a bit 9 stop comic I don't

417
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:20,630
know you guys have been I'm sorry it's
not the technology's fault is as yet no

418
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,130
program around mean technology to help
out on certain things are great if you

419
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,610
have a program in place if you don't
have a program in place and you focus on

420
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,479
technology or talents that's a big
problem

421
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,650
we as hackers don't care what you have
in place we're going to figure out a way

422
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:40,600
around this weather now you can attack
the sensor going and doing it when I

423
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,500
love about this industry is that you
know the media itself in in in kind of

424
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,419
what we create an InfoSec industry
spawns a lot of a technology it happens

425
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:53,580
and it's a multi-billion dollar industry
people are making tons of money off of

426
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,490
us ran out insane and what cracks me up
is you now have you know companies are

427
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,360
always a highly sophisticated attack and
is originating from China or North Korea

428
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,070
or wherever it was another matter and
you need to buy our product in order to

429
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,590
solve your issues what's interesting is
if you ever looked at a lot of the the

430
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:15,659
sandboxing technology out there is stuff
that that you know basically the way it

431
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,380
works is on whether it's a website for
downloading a file from websites or if

432
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,240
it's a email coming into infrastructure
inspect what it does it it takes that at

433
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,850
that that whatever that that email is
that website is and it puts it in the

434
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,559
sandbox right and it says okay you're
now inside my sandbox what is going on

435
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:36,809
when I go to this website or what is
going on when I go to the specific

436
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:40,240
system in a virtualized in its ok well
hey it's making modifications the

437
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,750
registry is making a call out this looks
like some sort of malicious behavior I

438
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,240
probably wouldn't recommend from
reputation perspective to allow you to

439
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,309
to to to LA this around the block at
wright-patterson attack kinda how than

440
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:55,850
the newer technology works rather the
same boxing stuff now it's funny but the

441
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,899
same boxing stuff is there still no
different than what we would consider

442
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,020
Antivirus is still very much signature
BC most acclaimed behavior they work off

443
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,750
a specific rules that they deem a
specific reputation and from there they

444
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:15,330
either allow your don't allow you so if
you know those rules or you know the

445
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,820
environment that they put themselves in
it's very easy to get around those so

446
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,428
for example a lot of the virtualization
technology if you sign it with a

447
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,700
legitimate code signing certificates
which by the way is really easy to get a

448
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,120
code signing certificates don't know
it's like 300 bucks vineyard good

449
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,299
reputation exponentially increases and
most the time even is making a call back

450
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,879
allows you to get it get around it now
my favorite ones which is the most

451
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,940
ridiculous and simplistic one to get
around most the virtualization

452
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,510
technology out there is three lines of
code was actually two lines of code be

453
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,580
considered import

454
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:51,949
a line of code but most in boxes are
very predictable environments so for

455
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,330
example I would say all of the five ones
that I've tested all this works here

456
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:04,040
because what they do is they try to
maximize how many types of things that

457
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,149
they can inspect at a given time so they
try to optimize their environment so

458
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,660
that you can take something in digested
in spit out really quickly in a business

459
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,590
environment so you have no more and more
room to work with and so the way the

460
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,720
network is they they they virtually
themselves in a sandbox know Sam boxes

461
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,260
are very predictable when it's a very
predictable they're usually using less

462
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,790
than two CPU course does anybody in your
environment any user any server anything

463
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:32,790
else you have in your environment use
lessons into CPU course no right and if

464
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,460
it was all be honest I don't wanna hack
that machine that's a slow ass machine

465
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,830
and I got more things I can I get back
in other people's machines are better

466
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,659
than that I'm not working not deal with
the one CPU core machine I'm a little

467
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,690
bit picky as a hacker so if you run into
this all you need to do normal wear your

468
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,300
writing and say hey if i'm running in
less than two CPU course than just exit

469
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,129
and don't do anything so when the code
comes in your little virtualization if

470
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,900
you keep you know prevention tool 10,000
inspect this this says hey what's going

471
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,650
on he is it you do anything bad no no I
mean less than once you I'm fine bro I'm

472
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:12,000
good at all you're gonna send it off as
soon as an environment that's more than

473
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,460
one CPU Mike hey I'm in more than one
CPU can finally have simply not right

474
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,160
and it sends your shell back and you
have full access to the computer so most

475
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,600
of this technology you see out there
whether its application whitelisting

476
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,929
mean I'll be honest application when
this thing I don't even recognize it on

477
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,380
a machine when I'm packing exam ever
really write a binary to a system

478
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,590
there's no need to sign it and you know
afterwards to make sure it's good and

479
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,040
it's fine so either way most of these
technologies see out there are layers I

480
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:48,360
agree but most of the time it's trivial
to get around these layers and so we

481
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,959
focused on now

482
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,450
insecurity is on a mission in this is it
was a big discussion point that they

483
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,710
become panel and we've been trying to
automate ourselves because we don't

484
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,440
have enough people right now to help and
so you have source code analyzers and

485
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,320
web scanners in vulnerability scanners
in you know tools that say they can

486
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,439
point pen testing also stuff because
they need to automate the human aspect

487
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,720
and a lot of those do help you know I'm
not going to say that doesn't help to

488
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,589
help for voluntary management they help
you get rid of the low-hanging fruit

489
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:19,000
those are great great things source code
analyzers are great to get you some

490
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,369
quick visibility and some of the
low-hanging fruit vulnerability scanners

491
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,960
fine maybe forty percent 30% and that's
a good number around what we find

492
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,359
sponsors as human beings so when you
talk about skills it's like a robust

493
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:35,699
American replace human beings that might
be the case might have asked I need a

494
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,210
Sunday I know but you actually need
people that are talented that actually

495
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,320
focus on research actually focus on the
types of attacks because that's what the

496
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,109
hackers are doing i mean you don't even
you might have hackers running

497
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,389
vulnerability scanners they but most of
the attacks you see I mean it's still

498
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,730
the simple stuff and they are hackers
the figure out those things and they

499
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,899
break into stuff on a mission isn't
going to actually solve or make anything

500
00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:03,130
around that in Chris Dickerson said a
good story are either buchanan he said

501
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,849
when are we going to going to be the
John her numerous the machine and

502
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:11,630
robustness see then if you don't know
the stories John Henry use individuals

503
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:15,780
trying to beat a machine and basically
he was able to beat the machine but into

504
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,040
buying it and you're so stressed out his
heart was so stressed out from trying to

505
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,230
beat the machine and if you look at our
industry were kind of moving to a try

506
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,720
out where we're trying to automate us as
much as possible and when is it going to

507
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,098
be a point to where you know the machine
itself end up beating up beating us and

508
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,960
I don't see that happening anytime soon

509
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,280
you know what I look at it as I see the
industry itself focusing on in in what

510
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,210
was interesting I'll talk about this in
a second but the industry has a way of

511
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,150
fixing itself if something isn't working

512
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,460
we're going to see more breaches and
receive more breezes right now right so

513
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,520
we have to fix ourselves in some way
shape or form continued see more and

514
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,509
more so if thats automation of animation
into fixing that infant fantastic but if

515
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,890
it doesn't fix itself we still see more
readers we actually need school people

516
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,480
to do things that's happening now but
the automation peace what was

517
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,150
interesting was just yesterday

518
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:09,520
Amazon in which he was part of the panel

519
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,610
and Derby in and we're talking about the
whole animation thing and then how you

520
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,130
gonna run into a lot of these
commoditized companies that the

521
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,630
businesses that that kind of focus on
things in it she posted yesterday I

522
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,180
wonder how many of us like business
models were killed today from Amazon

523
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,180
inspector if not for the Amazon
inspector on its way that will do

524
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,990
automatic security assessments over your
AWS infrastructure and so Am is

525
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:38,069
understood the whole new product line
where if you have an Amazon you know

526
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,840
server whatever it'll actually inspector
machines looking for configuration files

527
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,000
are vulnerabilities are things that
maybe maybe issues and what's

528
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,710
interesting is a lot of the industry has
moved more towards those commodity

529
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:54,180
Services amor what we call puppy mills
rain and the horrible term I but but

530
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,990
puppy mills are organizations that that
really you know hire somebody to perform

531
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:02,060
vulnerability scans and come out your
infrastructure and go and do something

532
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,820
around you know a basic vulnerability
scan that's being masqueraded as a Penta

533
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,990
and there is a reason for that industry
because there isn't enough talent out

534
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,270
there so companies like hey I need to go
to the experts and experts are these big

535
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,650
companies their names are ever I see him
on billboards I see them in magazines

536
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,950
they must be experts and these external
entities you know go for the profit line

537
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,109
right it's it's it's it's it's a
business thing for them so they like a I

538
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,280
can hire you know fifty junior people
and I can build them out as 50 senior

539
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,990
people because the InfoSec industry is
so messed up right now with talents and

540
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:40,399
were given these things and this is what
happens in so the puppy mill

541
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,700
organizations are kind of farming of
these types of services and companies

542
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,450
get these reports and the crap and they
focus on the basic type of thing in the

543
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:52,950
basics are in a bad thing but we can
only go this route so long and a lot of

544
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,390
the reasons why were in situations that
were out today is because of these types

545
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,779
of companies we are in these types of
situations because we're not doing all

546
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,300
these services both on the inside and
the outside because we don't have the

547
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,820
people to do it and John strand said
something that I really like and admire

548
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,360
and respect is a really good dude and he
said I do believe this industry is

549
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,070
headed for a crash was talking about is
that you know the the services out of

550
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,599
the companies that are doing

551
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,509
things in in ways of puppy mills the
commodity services can only go for so

552
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,829
long it's gonna be a massive crash that
focuses on industry itself in in the

553
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:31,210
ones that are doing the right things and
I'm not saying that since anybody at all

554
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,369
I'm just saying that the folks that are
trying to to focus on school and focus

555
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:37,890
on building security thing companies in
in making them better

556
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,569
will survive but you will see a crash in
in I like to use PCR as an example I'm

557
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:47,529
actually accuracy by the way I don't you
really do like I said something like

558
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:51,589
having those titles I can talk to people
about BC I can't sit through not and I'm

559
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:52,920
really not good at that

560
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,839
breaking into things but you know the
PCI stuff is an interesting topic

561
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,589
because I used to make fun of PC I'll
time you know the PCI compliant right

562
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,279
which means our secure but PC I did
something with PCI three that I thought

563
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:09,170
was really noble really awesome but it
should show you where we're moving to as

564
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,229
an industry with PCI tu vs PC i three
pci-dss you literally your scope for

565
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,899
penthouse was anything like you could
hire a puppy mill company or you can

566
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,920
hire a company to any want to there's no
real definition is just said they had to

567
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,940
be reputable very nice to make fun of PC
all the time for that because I hate

568
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,229
your rebuttal companies that mean you
know my my cousin who is studying

569
00:39:31,229 --> 00:39:35,739
computer science and knows how to run
Asus he's good for a series Roberto per

570
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:41,299
person who never classified what that
really meant no PCI 3 the change that

571
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:45,229
around it said hey you need to follow
one of these standards or services like

572
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:50,038
you know that the penetration testing
execution standard there she mentioned

573
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,650
when the standards that help create
knickers in a define we all helped

574
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,819
create that standard they reference that
as an actual method which is really cool

575
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,509
to see and so they should change the
definition to see anything that you can

576
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:06,900
hack from forget to credit card data you
need to now actually assess that part

577
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,989
companies now freaking out because of
that but is a good example of of how the

578
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:14,109
industry-changing PC actually change the
wording created a huge storm for

579
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:17,598
companies and now you have to do
legitimate pant estamos can be defeated

580
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,329
so if you look at that we can change
things you know as an individual as a

581
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,510
person resin or as a as a

582
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,130
industry we can actually change things
that actually go about four me red team

583
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,170
includes working together as one of
those those things that changes things

584
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:39,250
you know as a as an offensive person
myself I learned so much working with

585
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:44,330
people that are the defense and I'll
show you an example that i release at

586
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,590
all here that kind of work together to
make things easier but the Red Team Blue

587
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,330
team working together for me is is one
thing that I find extremely promising

588
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:55,860
when I go on an engagement I'm breaking
into something to see how people defend

589
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,260
better is awesome and I learned ways of
getting around that you know custody for

590
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,540
me which is great but the blue team you
know doesn't understand the offensive

591
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,820
types of attacks are out there so if
you're on the blue side you can figure

592
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,870
things out how are attacking become a
lot better as a as a as a company can

593
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:16,040
actually focus on things and it just
sharpen your skills I mean for me as a

594
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,520
person that's going into an environment
to understand going after having the

595
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,870
skills of the team to understand what
I'm going after work really well known

596
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:28,029
to say something really quick

597
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:34,960
not from the store heavy recommended and
is anybody here a pen tester on the

598
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:55,010
offense if you are not a way to learn
really well

599
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,950
you're not familiar with this at all
recently called the Pentastar framework

600
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,450
and it's great for folks who want to
learn the defense and the types of tools

601
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,029
they have as well as the office as well
as their emissary from the county Linux

602
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,050
right in Cali is a great distribution
framework the biggest thing for us in

603
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:14,890
pen testing is our tools right I told
our trade how we actually attack making

604
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,870
sure we have the latest and greatest in
updating the biggest issue that I have

605
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:23,140
with package distributions is keeping
things up today in central in a way that

606
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,150
I can understand and I can use and so I
created a module framework called

607
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:30,620
apprentices framework and you get from
get out just get a.com such trust a

608
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:37,700
second Missy PDF there and and it
follows a very similar syntax and method

609
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,490
towards Metasploit whichever a lot of us
are familiar with and what it is it's a

610
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,379
modular framework where you can easily
add tools if you want to add your own

611
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:50,670
defense assigned to write a model for
PCR takes about three minutes so I

612
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:54,400
created a whole programming language
behind pts that makes it easy for you to

613
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,380
do you wanna be a program or anything
like that in order to go through it and

614
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,770
what you do run PDF PDF PDF and what
we'll do is we'll actually got the

615
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,150
internet and look for the newest version
of PDF and automatically pulled down

616
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,280
with all the latest tools and everything
else that needs UK so grab the latest

617
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,400
version PDF and once you're inside and I
was here I just I just released version

618
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,640
123 that's not the way I wanted to but i
just released it literally on this

619
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,940
morning but it supports multiple
operating systems so for example of

620
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,460
using Ubuntu Fedora W in

621
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,740
supports do you think I guess you Linux
and a few others I see this as an

622
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,520
instrument supports a lot of different
configuration types on and different

623
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,890
distributions based off of that supports
meant fewer ones but anyways what it is

624
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:46,420
the way to install other tools

625
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,250
infrastructure to make him the way that
you want you can literally keep you up

626
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,230
to date with the latest and greatest NYC
by the greatest most of the tools if you

627
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,970
don't know this will not update almost
daily especially things like Metasploit

628
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:02,649
the social engineering toolkit all of
those actually generate the basis of

629
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:06,970
using a lot of the package distributions
out there didn't update for weeks months

630
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:11,709
sometimes longer than that to you
usually running you know type of

631
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,550
framework that's going to be out of date
or whatnot so I pull everything from

632
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,589
from different distributions and right
now I have a total of 68 tools that are

633
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:26,830
out there so you show models show you
all the tools are there that are

634
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,230
installed on it you can install but the
easiest way to do everything is just use

635
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,859
models install on and what this will do
is your basic version of Ubuntu your

636
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:43,040
basic version of Fedora were not as soon
as you run this command here literally

637
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,960
install every single tool that's inside
of its its distribution package in its

638
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,589
modules mineral pool and then if you run
it again and again it automatically

639
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:55,660
update them off for you to keep our word
of the day real-time really easy to do

640
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,629
and you know it's it's really pretty
pretty quick so I just gonna run this

641
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,920
you know going to pull everything on a
Mac install and everything all at this

642
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,760
run in the background can take a second
but even big holes like Metasploit

643
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,740
everything else it on america structure
everything in if you're familiar with

644
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,740
familiar with backtrack when it came out
right one thing I love them all back

645
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:23,020
track back and here is the pen testing
directory so if you went up and Suu

646
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,180
different tools you weren't familiar
with you can use before you can get

647
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,629
breaking out in different categories
illiteracy I'm exploitation phase of a

648
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:36,369
pen test welfare go to exploitation I
got all my tools you know configure

649
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,720
their real time that I can use for
exportation maybe I'm not from the

650
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,220
comics or

651
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,629
you know JBoss ON a bone or something
like that someone take a look at those

652
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,359
are good to go into the structure
structures in kind of use it but you

653
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,069
don't have to go in there they can
actually build launchers all anywhere

654
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,320
you want to say I wanna run

655
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,369
council it automatically billed
launchers are you know for you real-time

656
00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:01,220
say don't you know launching in and out
of your applications but actually read

657
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,069
equip model for PDF super easy if I
gotta exploitation that she used this as

658
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,460
he talked at all you need to do is
create a python file inside of whatever

659
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,980
you want to let us say its
intelligence-gathering or post

660
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,890
exploitation or whatever I discreetly
Python file in a dynamically imported

661
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:17,770
into you

662
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,349
PTI this index is pretty easy you know
the author of the module itself so who

663
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:27,280
actually made the model description of
the tall and support I get as CNN foul

664
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,869
poles file post-election hey they're
they're not using some sort of universe

665
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:36,099
repository so I actually got this I pull
the latest wanna do a difference to see

666
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,950
if there's any changes and then actually
install those for you

667
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:44,379
actual location itself we want to put
the repository and then any specific

668
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,490
requirements for Fedora for example in
those are the requirements for Fedora

669
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:55,839
Debian those requirements are WN where
do you want to go and install it and

670
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,339
there's something called after commands
which you know a lot of tools yet

671
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:03,410
they're on the you know 24 / configure
make make install or do some sort of you

672
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,980
know things afterwards in order make
sure you install it so after its done .

673
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,690
the files and everything you can to be
like ok I do not know figure you know

674
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,660
make make install and then after that
are going to run those through our after

675
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,890
a dozen insulation every time it
launches are just you know hey we're

676
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:22,868
going to type when I want to run my own
tool you inside of a dog it's also if I

677
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:29,450
want to go here to talk it going on so
so it's really easy way of keeping your

678
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,160
tools of the day is something that I use
regular everyday in an individual Penta

679
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,368
and as you can see here is going through
different model checking for different

680
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:42,710
changes so I mean you know I'd update
this morning so much but you know it

681
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,720
also has a shelter which is we have

682
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,290
do a lot of discussion around and bars
but overall it's all up to date on

683
00:47:50,290 --> 00:48:03,259
mccurry bottom for you in kind of handle
everything which is our focus in the

684
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,599
industry I think really needs to change
from focusing on automation to more the

685
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:11,970
skilled peace in in in leveraging
automation isn't a bad thing you know

686
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,618
having things to help us an ominous is
gonna be great but for me personally

687
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:20,280
that the peace around detection in
detecting attacks is really important to

688
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:25,650
us and so you know we focus on that
action focus on you know doing the

689
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,859
things the right way next building
skills will be highly successful

690
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:32,440
standardization of the biggest things
the deviation that we see in most

691
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,280
companies are what kills on you know a
weak password default password then

692
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,280
exposes everybody out there or I miss
configuration in a certain cases or

693
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,720
passwords that are just really terrible
those attempting to standardize upon in

694
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,759
your defense I want to put a couple
slides in here that that were things

695
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,900
that I've seen workin stop me a lot and
a lot of cases the randomization of

696
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,560
local admin account is a huge one if you
know if if I compromise one workstation

697
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,740
I'm able to move from that one
workstation to others

698
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,589
that's a problem you stop that you a
randomized a local admin account for

699
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:10,570
disabled my account that's a big deal if
you actually have a group policy setting

700
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:15,339
and windows and in-service 2010 above
around on me to disable the local admin

701
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:19,680
account I don't know this number doesn't
actually work you have to have another

702
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,899
admin account and therefore they
actually working actually for the

703
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,260
disabled it so if you actually it's like
the Group Policy disabled local admins

704
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:29,490
your local admin account still active
and valid on there so you have to have a

705
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,979
second admin accounts in order for you
to be able to see it will be default

706
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,339
admin account because they don't want
you to accidentally lock yourself out

707
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,940
which really sucks but most of the time
people complain the cold will have to

708
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,260
save a local admins and two guests just
arrived from the demeanor whatever I

709
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:46,070
can't get enough of you reboot in safe
mode you can enable the local admin

710
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,740
account you can then do your servicing
for that so it's actually get one but

711
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:55,649
randomizing just as good roads into
Manama accounts are really good reason

712
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,180
to why you're having to me in a minute

713
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,799
counts long anything other than domain
controllers your domain an account

714
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,630
belonging to meet demand control
themselves than having you know admins

715
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:08,020
over servers as a different group if i
dont have a domain admin account that I

716
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,800
can hack on another member server I'm
not gonna get access to your domain it

717
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,770
shows are usually pretty well locked out
so those are you know key concepts I'm

718
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,740
it's really have a recommend there are
ways of circumventing it but it's really

719
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,220
difficult it's called the enhanced
mitigation experience toolkit is a free

720
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,720
tool for Microsoft on and what it does
is it actually looks a lot of the

721
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,750
exploitation techniques that we use
today and it stops on a pretty good like

722
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,450
I for example they return oriented
programming arap it looks at methods for

723
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:37,970
that tries to disable that a disallowed
from from executing a lot of the

724
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:42,270
diplomat this for exploitation you can
use in what's great about a minute and

725
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:45,069
is really going to kind of transparent
background and you only white listings

726
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:48,970
you want to but I have they recommend
for a printer stuff you know putting out

727
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:49,919
like I S

728
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,490
you know that process or you know common
things like Adobe Java Office documents

729
00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:00,578
things like that is very easy to you to
deploy a blockers Bolton group policy to

730
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:03,349
see things you can do with an app Locker
on that have stopped me before in the

731
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:07,750
past when is if you have good separation
of admin accounts forces your user

732
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,089
accounts so for example users are
running as local admins to users ever

733
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:17,900
need to run PowerShell ever no right to
disallow PowerShell from running from a

734
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,200
blocker and all of a sudden you stopped
like 90% of my exploitation techniques I

735
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,770
use and that's a really easy fix that's
a good to second thing you can do within

736
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,079
a blocker the second one is this a
longer school sometime most Marissa

737
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,869
temporary in all users are things like
that doesn't excuse from there on our

738
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:38,160
assignment asians a key concept
obviously focusing on detection

739
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,480
capabilities removing basic attack
factors like defaults and things like

740
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,390
that are all good ways so those are key
things at that stop me as an attacker

741
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:51,799
that really make it difficult for me is
to get into their systems so overall I

742
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:55,079
mean I think we're getting better as an
industry mean if you look at ten years

743
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:59,650
ago to now I mean I've never seen the
type of adoption we've had in security

744
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,579
that we do now it's wonderful to see
it's awesome to see it's cool to see

745
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:07,020
this industry going crazy and spawning
and going to find ways in having folks

746
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,109
are just coming out of college and hold
a dedicated programs for information

747
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:10,520
security

748
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,430
it's a really cool time to be
experiencing a really excited I think

749
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:17,560
we're getting better overall as an
industry we have to be really careful

750
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:22,750
about the ways that we take about it in
if we continue to invest millions and

751
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,260
millions and millions and millions of
dollars into security and we continue to

752
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,400
see bridging bridging bridging Rita
bridges we're gonna be left upon as he

753
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,890
was things that we're not going to be a
very successful industry in the future

754
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,810
right now there's an immediate need for
us but that can definitely change as

755
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:40,860
time grows best really appreciate me out
here at brew Khan and I hope we learn

756
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:44,470
something new and i've you know if you
have any questions feel free to ping me
