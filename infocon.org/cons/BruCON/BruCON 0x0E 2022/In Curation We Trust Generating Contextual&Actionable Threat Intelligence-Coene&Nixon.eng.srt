1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,600
so good afternoon everyone I'm very

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,760
pleased to see all of you here

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,440
um really appreciate that that you show

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,500
up for the final stages of bricon here

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,000
today

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,920
um we're going to talk today about

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,640
curation threat intelligence curation

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,619
um but maybe just first a bit about our

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,199
us so I'm Michelle kuna I'm the head of

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
instant response and threat intelligence

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,820
at and viso in addition to that I'm also

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,500
an instructor for science actually it's

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,719
the SEC 599 course which is a purple

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,399
theming course I'm joined here today

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,920
with my colleague Robert hey I'm Robert

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,840
Nixon I work at invisible with Michelle

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,280
and I head up the threat intelligence

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,719
Department there

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,360
all right so what are we going to talk

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,160
about today we're going to start with

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,719
the problem statement the problem

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,300
statement of bad threat intelligence

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,879
that we all get into our feet we'll talk

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,500
about some examples and we'll talk about

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,899
okay what's the procedure that we

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,300
created or thought up

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,359
um to make sure that whatever we have as

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,339
an end product that it contains as

29
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,760
little false positives as possible

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,380
after that we'll also talk a bit about

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,299
our lessons learned what are some of the

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,799
key things if you want to do that for

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,720
your your own organizations what are

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,760
some of the key things that you want to

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,880
take into account that perhaps sometimes

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,040
we have lost side of and that we would

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,860
advise you not to lose sight of and

38
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,360
we'll also talk about our roadmap

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,340
because it's not done yet this will be

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,259
an everlasting project constant

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,600
improvements constantly improving how we

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,939
do the curation in itself then we'll

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,040
have some times for questions and

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,200
answers hopefully the answers

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,259
now before diving into curation itself

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,020
let me very quickly introduce Miss for

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,939
the people who are not aware what mispus

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,659
or why you would use uh Miss is uh molar

49
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,000
information sharing platform that's what

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,180
the handle stands for it's a threat

51
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,280
intelligence platform so you can store

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
your indicators your iocs in there you

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,079
can store information about financial

54
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,579
fraud and there you can store

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,940
information about malware samples

56
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,919
malware information platform

57
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,300
um you can store all kinds of

58
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,099
information in there and then use it

59
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,580
within your own organization of course

60
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,920
um you can also use it to share it's

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,959
what it was intended for by the way

62
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:23,879
anyone knows where misp was created

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,860
first

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,340
Belgium absolutely yes so something to

65
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,959
be really proud of currently it's

66
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,760
maintained by by Circle and they're

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,099
doing an awesome job really improving it

68
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,440
building new capabilities we'll talk

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,180
about some of those new capabilities as

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,459
well that really help us as Stratton

71
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,319
towel analysts and that really help us

72
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,540
to share threat intelligence with

73
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,300
everyone that we want to do of course

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,760
that also brings us to the exact problem

75
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
now maybe just a show of hands here who

76
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,940
is involved in the threat intelligence

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,560
within the organization who works with

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,180
threat intelligence feeds maybe as a

79
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,739
stock analyst you get in present our

80
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,920
feeds and you get those iocs okay

81
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,260
all right quite a few people okay for

82
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,480
those people specifically have you ever

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,760
seen an indicator

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,840
like this in your threaten towel feet

85
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,099
right

86
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,140
808.8

87
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,980
Google DNS could be something else

88
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,300
127.001 something we come across quite

89
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,680
frequently as well

90
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,840
and that of course within misp you have

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,420
than the two IDs flag enabled meaning

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,300
that if you send that if you export it

93
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,540
this ioc will be exported and will be

94
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,459
sent to your sock to your automation

95
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,060
tools or anything else there now if you

96
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,280
send something like this to your sock

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
what happens

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,400
like all alarm Bells go off

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,099
hundreds of incident tickets are created

100
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,040
the next reaction is that

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,319
Robert or myself we got a phone call

102
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,239
it's like what have you done

103
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,980
why are we getting all these tickets why

104
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,480
do you give us this bad intelligence

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
like this is super obvious isn't it

106
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,159
so that's the problem that we were

107
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,560
facing about a year and a half two years

108
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,978
ago quite frequently because we are

109
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,358
connected we're with our mystery

110
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,820
connected to various different sources

111
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,540
open source sources through Circle but

112
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,180
also more closed sources also we ingest

113
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,759
from from commercial sources flat

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,979
intelligence I'll tell you even with

115
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,600
commercial sources

116
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
people who have seen it you will also

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,860
face something like that even within

118
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,900
commercial sources can happen that there

119
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,880
are false positives present in the

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,979
indicator of compromised feet

121
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,560
so what happens then you get some

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,080
garbage within your threat and tile feed

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
now what do we do with threat

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,680
intelligence we try to enrich it so we

125
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,380
get enriched garbage we of course also

126
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,020
want to correlate that with all kinds of

127
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,919
other

128
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,020
threat intelligence so we get correlated

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,639
garbage

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,500
then we see some garbage we get a

131
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,720
sighting because our success oh we've

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,520
seen this we have a trigger we have hit

133
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,500
so this is indeed an indicator that

134
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
lacked something within our environment

135
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,040
so we have a sighting on our garbage

136
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,860
which leads to an inflating balloon of

137
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,120
garbage

138
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
this is not what we want so we started

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,280
thinking okay how can we improve upon

140
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,860
that so the first thing that we did was

141
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,600
look within our own organization okay

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,419
who are the producers and the consumers

143
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,000
of threat intelligence it's important to

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,699
know John talked about this just earlier

145
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,520
in previous presentation talking to your

146
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,500
consumers of threat intelligence talk to

147
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,180
the producers understanding their

148
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,220
intelligence requirements as well so

149
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,780
that's what we did and within and these

150
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,400
are the company that we work for we have

151
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,860
three main teams that use threat

152
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,380
intelligence is the MDR team it's the

153
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,479
cert and of course the threat and tell

154
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,680
team itself

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,180
they all

156
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,639
with within our organization this might

157
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,500
differ for your organizations of course

158
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,720
within our organization they're all

159
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
producers and consumers at the same time

160
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,940
looking at our MDR team uh of course

161
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,300
sock monitoring towel feeds

162
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,699
does need explanation if they see

163
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,840
something if they get a phishing email

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
talked about fishing earlier this

165
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
morning if we get a phishing email we

166
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
have some indicators that we can extract

167
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,979
from it it's like sender IP address we

168
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,680
have URLs maybe some IP addresses all

169
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,940
those types of things we also want to

170
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,979
put that into our trat and tile database

171
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:34,080
because then we can go to our other

172
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,060
clients or just for in the future when

173
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,979
we see this happening again or we see

174
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,740
someone click on that URL we can start

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,600
correlating we can start taking action

176
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,520
on that as well so they create threat

177
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,800
intelligence in that way as well also

178
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,259
you Stratton towel for threat hunting

179
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,840
for the T-shirt very easy we use

180
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,660
Stratton towel in all its various forms

181
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,400
to do instant response we do malware

182
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
analysis so we feed back there we use it

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,780
for compromise assessments and a lot

184
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,919
more

185
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,900
for our threat intelligence team then

186
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,300
well they do everything around threat

187
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,280
intelligence so some examples here on

188
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,380
the slide creating drat intelligence

189
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,620
briefings create the Feats or upgrade

190
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,479
defeats let's put it like that for our

191
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,240
sock and all kinds of other things so

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,699
lots of work to be done around that

193
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,759
Stratton towel so of course we want to

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
have good data data that we can trust

195
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
in the first step that we took to solve

196
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,099
partially solve the problem of uh bad

197
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,620
threat intelligence or false positives

198
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,500
we started with creating a I like to

199
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,599
call it a misp ecosystem because it

200
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,460
sounds fancy it's collection of four

201
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,380
misps so it's not that fancy it's just

202
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,479
ecosystem sounds good

203
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,940
so there we have our Edge misp this is

204
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,300
where everything enters all of our feeds

205
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,000
they all enter in our Edge Mist so this

206
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,460
is the trash can you can call it like

207
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,419
that on this one we will do our curation

208
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,220
we will make sure that the data that

209
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
goes from there towards our Central misp

210
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,020
that that is the clean data that that's

211
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
already clean so this is our single

212
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,160
source of Truth this is the central

213
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,620
brain for our threat intelligence itself

214
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,900
we went a bit further as I said we have

215
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,639
four missed instances running currently

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,440
because we have a separate one for our

217
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
cert we have separate one for our uh for

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,240
our sock why because well we sent all

219
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,360
the data from the central to the sock

220
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,458
um they then can use it in various ways

221
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,159
they can also feedback data in that mist

222
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,020
but then because we want to have that

223
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,360
Central one as a single source of Truth

224
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,880
we're also going to curate whatever is

225
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,039
coming back from the sock

226
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,380
we have good sock people but still it's

227
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,600
a good idea to have a look at okay what

228
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,480
are we going to feed back there

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,100
accidents happen mistakes can be made

230
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,100
from the scissored side we decided to

231
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,720
get a fully separate one as well because

232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,700
well of course we cannot share

233
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,140
everything that we do in terms of

234
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,300
incident response cases with the rest of

235
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,980
the company or with other clients there

236
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,519
so he's decided to split all of that up

237
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,320
now that's an architecture does

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,360
architecture solve our problem at this

239
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,940
point in time no not really we're gonna

240
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,440
need a bit more because we still have

241
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,019
those false positives we still get a lot

242
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,899
events in with that are on the the

243
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,580
warding list to miss warning list to

244
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,620
talk more about that in a bit

245
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,620
um we also get events that don't have

246
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,660
context and we have some here on the

247
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,360
slide there's no tax within missed you

248
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,880
can use tagging to say this is this kind

249
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,940
of event it's the lp white it's related

250
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,760
to a certain draft actor x y and z

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,100
um so contextualization what is this

252
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,620
event about so you can easily see it

253
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,380
also inconsistencies we try to use as

254
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,600
much automation as possible

255
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,300
if you're doing automation what do you

256
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,700
need you need consistent data to begin

257
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,580
with if we say we're going to send only

258
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,779
TLP white indicators to our sock just as

259
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,600
an example well as you can see here on

260
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,160
the slide already there's five different

261
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,980
ways of saying ah this data is DLP white

262
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,260
how is our automation going to do that's

263
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,959
very likely that we're going to miss a

264
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,480
large portion of the data at that point

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,580
in time so we want to normalize all of

266
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,560
that as well

267
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,360
and our last one we need to think about

268
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,360
okay is this actionable the events that

269
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,000
we get in are they actionable an event

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,620
with 80 000 iocs 80 000 IP addresses is

271
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,120
it actionable can you do something with

272
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,200
it

273
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
but yes you can send it to your firewall

274
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,080
and block all 80 000 IPS is that going

275
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,720
to end well for you

276
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,420
probably not right so do you know about

277
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,820
a for each of those 80 000 IP addresses

278
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,200
do you have all the context around them

279
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,600
why is this IP address here probably not

280
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,399
so those are also things that we will

281
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,440
think about during our curation

282
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,820
procedure

283
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,980
so practically speaking what do we do

284
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,720
three main things

285
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
we remove false positives

286
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,980
so it's easy right it's like we remove

287
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,940
false positives we're done that's it now

288
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,079
unfortunately it's not that easy we do

289
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,420
it we try to do it in a bit of a clever

290
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,380
way clever way not invented by us to be

291
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,180
honest but the warning list we use the

292
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,760
misp warning list so Circle and the

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
community has created warning lists RFC

294
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,060
1918 IP addresses and 192 168 0.1 if

295
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,519
that's in your ioc list then you're

296
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,899
going to get a warning saying okay

297
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,240
there's an RFC 1918 IP address here

298
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,459
there's a cloudflare IP address here

299
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,839
there's something else so you can

300
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,940
already visually see oh something's

301
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,740
happening here I do need to investigate

302
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,899
a bit more the only thing that we do

303
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,720
with those removing false positives is

304
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
creating our own custom warning lists

305
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,000
when we send something to the sock as I

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,399
said we're not perfect so it happens

307
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,500
that we send a false positive to the

308
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,459
sock

309
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,160
probably not 8.8.8.8 but could be

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,540
something else

311
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,200
um

312
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,140
our vision is or our ideas we can fail

313
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,959
but we can only fail once so if we send

314
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,079
something bad there we want to prevent

315
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,480
that that bad thing

316
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,180
shows up again the month after so he

317
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,860
created custom warning lists and the

318
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,720
sock themselves say when they say ah

319
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,060
this is a bad indicator this is the

320
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,920
reason for it we add it to the custom

321
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,720
warning list so it will never end up

322
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,420
within our missed infrastructure again

323
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,980
and of course we have the analyst

324
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,899
judgment there is some manual work I

325
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,940
said we do try to automate as much as

326
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,220
possible but there is some manual work

327
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,260
to be done there as well so we have our

328
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,079
analyst judgment and they will be mainly

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,480
involved in the following steps here for

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,139
example adding contextualization

331
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,139
I'll give you an example if you get in

332
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,300
an event and it says

333
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,700
fishing fishing meal and then you have

334
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,279
the different indicators there you have

335
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:06,480
a subject line you have two URLs and you

336
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
have an IP address

337
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,779
that's it

338
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,519
you send that to the sock

339
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,740
and then they get a hit on that IP

340
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,700
address

341
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,200
they see oh this is an IP address

342
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,420
related to a fishing Mill

343
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,040
what's the action that they're likely

344
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,300
going to take

345
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,160
they're going to kick off your fishing

346
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,440
Playbook right

347
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,660
is that the right action to take at that

348
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,120
point in time

349
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,740
we don't know

350
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,899
because it could indeed be the IP

351
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,600
address of maybe the server that was

352
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,820
used to send that email could be the IP

353
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,579
address of the URL That Was Then clicked

354
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,500
but it could also be the IP address

355
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,779
that's already reached in a few further

356
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,880
stages where the user already downloaded

357
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,100
some malware on disk and that started

358
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
then communicating with the C2 might be

359
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,200
the c2ip address as well you need to

360
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,820
have that context you need to have that

361
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,800
context as an analyst to decide okay

362
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,380
what action am I going to take here

363
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,240
right now based on what I'm seeing

364
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,680
because the actions that you're going to

365
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
take for a phishing email someone that

366
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
clicked on a phishing link versus

367
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,440
there's active command and control

368
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,720
communication it's going to be wildly

369
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,980
different of course

370
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,440
so we want to add context to all our

371
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,959
events preferably to all our iocs

372
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,339
themselves as well

373
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,860
so what are we going to add we're going

374
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,800
to try as much as possible at miter

375
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,200
attack tags

376
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,720
to everything say okay where are we in

377
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,060
the kill chain uh talk about threat

378
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,860
actors what tradector are we looking at

379
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,320
is this a ransomware group is this a

380
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,620
nation state maybe is this just activist

381
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,779
something like that

382
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,240
um going to whoops

383
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,399
add all kinds of other information as

384
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,560
much information as we actually can

385
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,079
there also add some mandatory TLP

386
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,019
tagging uniform DLP tagging so that our

387
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,639
automation can of course work with that

388
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,860
again as well now there's a last step

389
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,500
we're going to verify our event

390
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,920
is it relevant is it useful did were we

391
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,199
able to add sufficient context on the

392
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,380
event is it an event with 80 000 IP

393
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,480
addresses I'm probably gonna push it

394
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,000
aside and not ingest it at that point in

395
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,959
time

396
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,880
um also look at okay

397
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,639
this is an event that comes in as a new

398
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,740
event into our misp but it talks about

399
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,420
the fishing mail that somebody received

400
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,639
in 2019

401
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,240
is it still relevant it could be but

402
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,420
it's unlikely so might already domain

403
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,920
might be reused all kinds of different

404
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
things so we do think about that that's

405
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,959
a bit the analyst judgment that we have

406
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,000
there as well

407
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,639
but as I said we do lots of automation

408
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,860
as much as we can and that's what Robert

409
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,139
is going to talk about right now

410
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,899
all right so in this funnel you see they

411
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,279
were basically they're some of the

412
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,260
requirements that we have for this

413
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,600
effort we're trying to remove false

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,940
positives we're trying to add

415
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,199
contextualization and we're trying to

416
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,019
verify the relevance of the Intel that

417
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,399
we're given to the sock

418
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,779
we don't want to be known as the people

419
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,440
that just shove dirty Intel into a sock

420
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,000
so

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
how are we going to do this

422
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,079
well we started by looking at what can

423
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,459
we automate that's what you should do

424
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,680
right look at what you can automate and

425
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,720
then look at what you have to create a

426
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,399
manual procedure for get your low

427
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,100
hanging fruit so we wrote some zmq

428
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,079
scripts that'll get into a little bit

429
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,940
we made sure that we were using those

430
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,339
warning lists and syncing them from the

431
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,560
sock so the sock maintains them then we

432
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,000
sync them and we'll talk a little bit

433
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,860
more about that later and we make sure

434
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,380
that we can do those tags in a proper

435
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,480
way so that they when they come into the

436
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,480
misp they're in a standard format that

437
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,920
can be used across all automation

438
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,779
processes

439
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,259
all right

440
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,720
so we start with the edge misp

441
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,940
and inside the edge mist is where all of

442
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,600
our dirty until comes from so it's where

443
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,820
we send any feed that we don't trust

444
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,919
enough to consider it zero false

445
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,020
positives

446
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,220
in that uh Edge mist

447
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,900
uses the zmq pub sub message system

448
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,419
we subscribe we create a script that

449
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,780
subscribes to that zmq

450
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,160
um subscription

451
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,559
and then it listens for events coming in

452
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,260
it unpublishes those events so that it

453
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,000
doesn't get synced to your other

454
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,919
instances

455
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,059
and then we also Mark it with a workflow

456
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,140
incomplete tag

457
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,660
and that workflow incomplete tag is the

458
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,820
trigger to tell the Intel analyst that

459
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,679
there's work that needs to be done you

460
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,900
need to go and look at this event and

461
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,360
start your manual curation process

462
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,160
but we also

463
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,380
have an automated script that tags the

464
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,559
source so in miss you can it's more of a

465
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,720
hub and spoke system you can have one

466
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,940
main miss that has multiple

467
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,799
organizations inside

468
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,559
so we want to know what is the main misp

469
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,120
that that came from did it come from

470
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,400
first did it go what have you and what

471
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,260
is the actual Creator organization of

472
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,820
that as well

473
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,760
so that we can track these events

474
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,039
and then we want to sanitize we want to

475
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,320
make sure that it's having has all the

476
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,760
tags it's supposed to have

477
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,520
and with top 2.0 coming out we're gonna

478
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,140
have to adjust our scripts right now

479
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,880
we're still using top one

480
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,179
but top 2.0 you're talking about white

481
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,640
to clear you got Amber strict so we have

482
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,380
to do some modifications there as well

483
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,120
and then after the automation's complete

484
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
we move into the manual process so like

485
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,260
I said before we have the workflow

486
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,080
incomplete tag

487
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,900
and it's unpublished so there's no harm

488
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,640
the event's just sitting in the Mist

489
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,340
waiting to be actioned

490
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,260
there's also warning lists that we have

491
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,820
enabled that Michelle talked about

492
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,539
earlier uh the community maintained ones

493
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,940
as well as our custom ones

494
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,460
and inside of an event in this it'll

495
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,039
have a flag that says hey something in

496
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,960
this event matches one of your warning

497
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,299
lists and then you can filter your iocs

498
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,220
based on which ones match the warning

499
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,340
list so that gives you a subsection of

500
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,160
the bigger event to look at maybe I

501
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,780
should turn these off or maybe I should

502
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,660
delete the individual attributes

503
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,000
and then you add any type of context you

504
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,880
can so from the event

505
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,100
if you can sometimes you can't depending

506
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,080
on how much data is there

507
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,600
can you add the country that was

508
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
targeted can you add the sector that was

509
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,980
targeted can you add the malware type

510
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,260
now all of this information really helps

511
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,120
the analyst if it were to ever fire

512
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,820
inside of the song

513
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,559
as you can see there's some examples

514
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,600
like the miterate tech that we were

515
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,679
talking about earlier in different

516
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,539
sectors

517
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,640
and then the last thing we do before we

518
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,660
hit publish is make sure that if I was

519
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,160
in the sock

520
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,220
and one of these attributes fired would

521
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,500
I be able to do something with it

522
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,059
and then

523
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,039
we put the workflow complete type where

524
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,160
we remove the workflow incomplete tag we

525
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,380
add the workflow complete tag and we

526
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,980
publish there's a rule inside of misp

527
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,919
where you can say that a tag is required

528
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,340
so without a workflow tag of some sort

529
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,559
the this event won't publish at all

530
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,539
it'll say you have to have some sort of

531
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,419
workflow Tech now it will publish

532
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,559
with any workflow tag the way it was but

533
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,240
we'll talk about more about how that's

534
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,160
been improved in just a few minutes

535
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,840
and then after it's published it gets

536
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,460
automatically sent to the central misp

537
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,000
where it's then sent on to the sock

538
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,580
and this is a little bit more uh deeper

539
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,940
explanation of our our display of our

540
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,820
custom warning list so within misf you

541
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,520
have the commer the community and circle

542
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,799
maintained warning lists so you're

543
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,260
talking about your Alexa top 100

544
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,940
000 uh Cisco umbrella Florian Ross list

545
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,660
of hashes for a known

546
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,160
binaries that trigger false positives

547
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,260
empty file hashes Etc

548
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,380
so the sock maintains the Nitro one

549
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,740
that's Nitro is our MDR branding

550
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,980
and they maintain those lists inside of

551
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,480
the sock misp

552
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,340
and we have a script that goes and

553
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,860
fetches that warning list those warning

554
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,020
lists and then replicates it on all of

555
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,059
our other myths so that we stay up to

556
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,520
date with what they've seen

557
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,220
so I don't have to wait for a email it's

558
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,980
already in the misp

559
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,360
so

560
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,179
you do get organizations

561
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,520
that share too much

562
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,580
bad Intel it happens they have a bad

563
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,159
process they're not following good work

564
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,720
policies or they don't have a good

565
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,299
threat intelligence life cycle and they

566
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,980
constantly generate bad intelligence you

567
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,720
have to do something about that the

568
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,640
return on investment of the Intelligence

569
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,159
coming in needs to pay for itself you

570
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,200
don't need to spend eight hours a day

571
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,059
curating intelligence

572
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,820
and then not doing anything else

573
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,780
so we've developed a tracker for bad

574
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,820
organizations

575
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,419
if you create five bad

576
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:28,740
events

577
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,700
then you're out basically so we

578
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,940
Blacklist your uuid or block list in

579
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,059
missed terms once the uuid is put into

580
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,640
the organizational block list inside of

581
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,860
misp those events are no longer

582
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,400
extractable via the API so if the sock

583
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,679
queries their misp to get indicators

584
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
compromised they won't get any from a

585
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,720
block listed organization

586
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,460
and then there's a script that we have

587
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,679
that syncs that block list with all our

588
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,659
other Mists so that it stays current

589
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,419
so what have we seen so far and I'll

590
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:09,020
give you some numbers

591
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,020
so in a little over a year almost

592
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,960
almost two almost two years now

593
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,140
we've seen more than 3492 events but

594
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,760
that's how many we have in the inbound

595
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,799
misp right these are numbers from the

596
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,240
inbound Miss

597
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,700
that number is lower than what we've

598
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,260
actually seen because we've removed some

599
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,559
events that were garbage basically

600
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,799
and we got around 2 million attributes

601
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,580
all of those attributes are actionable

602
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,520
or they're aged out so their IP

603
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,159
addresses they're still in the misp for

604
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,679
historical purposes for

605
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,900
correlation when we get new intelligence

606
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,880
in have we ever seen this IP before have

607
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,440
we ever seen this hash before what was

608
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,419
it related to before that it's being

609
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,460
used for now

610
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,360
and as you see there in the bottom

611
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,280
we've blacklisted 16 organizations

612
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,880
but if you see the number above there's

613
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,799
607 unique organizations that have

614
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,539
shared intelligence with us at some

615
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,740
point in time

616
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,539
so we've only blacklisted or block

617
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,760
listed

618
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,140
2.6 percent

619
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,179
that's pretty good I mean for a

620
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,820
community you're doing a pretty good job

621
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,520
there's just a few outliers that

622
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,860
you got to close the door on them

623
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,260
so what are some of the other things

624
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,500
that we're doing to help in this mission

625
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,780
so with false positives

626
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,760
we're matching

627
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,280
before the analyst gets into the the

628
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,900
work for the day

629
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,880
about three or four a.m depending on the

630
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
Cron job on which bucks

631
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,960
on the inbound misp

632
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
we extract all hashes from unpublished

633
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,900
events and then match them against the

634
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,960
nsrl database if it's in and we don't

635
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,120
use the NRS I mean

636
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,480
in s or L database the whole thing it's

637
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,720
rather large we use circles hash lookup

638
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,980
interface

639
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,880
so they provide a web interface with API

640
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,039
and it's not just nsrl in their hash

641
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,380
lookup database it's known malicious

642
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,940
stuff it's all types of things for their

643
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,860
hash lookup service

644
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,080
but if you look down into the provider

645
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,240
fields of the API response you can

646
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,600
select nsrl

647
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Legacy

648
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,380
so if the API response is this hash is

649
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,440
seen in the nsrl Legacy database we take

650
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,159
away that two at two IDs flag so it's

651
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
not going to alert

652
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,020
if it's published and we tag that

653
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,059
attribute nsrl

654
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,159
now we don't leave it like that because

655
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,440
there could be

656
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,000
depending on the environment depending

657
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,820
on the tool what have you

658
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,120
we may flip the the IDS flag back on

659
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,480
manually but that tag tells us hey you

660
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
might want to look at this but at least

661
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,919
if if for some reason we don't look at

662
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,260
it it's been

663
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,779
defend I guess you could say

664
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,059
if it does slip through it won't alert

665
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,000
and then we also like I was saying We

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,620
sync those custom warning lists with our

667
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,699
Nitro MDR service

668
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,200
aging out of indicators this is always a

669
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,059
big topic everybody wants to know what's

670
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,980
the magic number how long should this IP

671
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,500
address live and whatever we go we go by

672
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,659
the last scene date

673
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,000
so from that last scene date

674
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,820
we we're pretty strict so

675
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,419
14 days for IPs

676
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,860
30 days for domains 60 days for urls

677
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,659
unless they get into the warning list

678
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,820
what have you and then they get turned

679
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,600
off

680
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,940
now there is an advanced use case in

681
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,320
this called decaying models now they use

682
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,880
formulas

683
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,159
based on tagging levels and you can

684
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,039
create multiple decaying models based on

685
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,900
what type of

686
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,600
tagging an attribute it is so say for

687
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,700
phishing

688
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,640
iocs if you tag the event as phishing

689
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,100
and you give it a

690
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,900
NATO admirality code of B so for

691
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,460
trustworthiness

692
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,520
you can set a formula that will Decay it

693
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,140
over time now that's an advanced use

694
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,000
case all of your tagging has to be in

695
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,059
place that's something that's really

696
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:38,299
usable within a organization as a an MDR

697
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,080
consultancy that's a little harder

698
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,059
because we can't match that directly up

699
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,559
with a single organization

700
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,960
scraping web sources

701
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,620
so as a threat and tele analyst and the

702
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,940
stock analyst security professional

703
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,640
you're always looking at blogs secure

704
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,980
list blog you got cribs shooting stuff

705
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,960
off you're looking at Twitter all this

706
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,980
stuff

707
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,880
well one of our Freelancers

708
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,539
created a web scraper for misp

709
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:13,020
and what it does it go you can give it a

710
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,980
RSS feed or a manual URL in the GUI

711
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,440
and it'll go scrape the page

712
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,640
it'll use Miss built-in HTML to mark

713
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,480
down

714
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,500
converter dump that data into the misp

715
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,400
event

716
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,880
and then use regex's to parse

717
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,120
the data looking for IP addresses hashes

718
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,460
URLs domains

719
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,539
Etc

720
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:43,799
registry keys it'll even look for

721
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,100
keyword matches for tagging

722
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,860
so if it says this is miter attack

723
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,440
technique

724
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,600
teas1076 it's going to tag it with the

725
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,960
miteratec framework for you done

726
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,520
and then when you come in it's

727
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,159
unpublished it has all this tagging

728
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,340
the actual website is listed as an event

729
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,039
report inside of the misp event so an

730
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,080
event within of an event

731
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,659
all in markdown with the highlighted

732
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:14,840
bubbles over all your indicators done

733
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,659
now it's keyword matching for these tags

734
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,659
so there may be some instances where you

735
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,220
need to take a Tag Away

736
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,559
so it matched Google and now it's saying

737
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,480
it's a misinformation campaign but it's

738
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,640
just a link to Google you know things

739
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,919
like that happen but for the most part

740
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,779
it's done for you you just got to

741
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,919
validate and publish

742
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,659
and then bulk deleting of events so

743
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,880
sometimes you do have bad events that

744
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,640
slip through or you lose a license for a

745
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,220
commercial intelligence feed and that uh

746
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,600
providers like you've got to get all of

747
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,860
our stuff out of here

748
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,380
your database you can't share it anymore

749
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,820
fine

750
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,399
we have a script that you can configure

751
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,820
to search for a certain attribute a date

752
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,240
range an organization and it deletes all

753
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,100
of those events

754
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,620
and then it takes the uuids of those

755
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,720
events and deletes them on all the other

756
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,940
myths that are connected to our Central

757
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,159
misp so it cleans up the database

758
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,120
so this is a new feature

759
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
called workflows in misp

760
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,260
and we talked about automation we talked

761
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,299
about zmq Scripts

762
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,760
this is basically something that was

763
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,640
relatively uh

764
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,399
added relatively recently and it's still

765
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,399
beta-ish but it's like having a sore

766
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
inside your Mist basically automation

767
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,899
within your misp

768
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,700
so it's a little video here we'll see

769
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,020
how

770
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,539
I don't have controls to control the

771
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:49,799
pause or anything but what I'm going to

772
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,000
do here

773
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,740
I'm going to show you how we're going to

774
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,960
create a workflow so we're going to go

775
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,220
to the administration tab we're going to

776
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,559
click on workflows

777
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,480
we're going to select

778
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,299
the event publish trigger

779
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:05,039
so that's going to trigger whenever you

780
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,260
go to publish an event

781
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,120
and we're going to say if this event

782
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,939
doesn't have the workflow complete tag

783
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,779
we're going to do something

784
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,000
about that

785
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,279
I told you earlier that it would publish

786
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,980
the features of the old misp before

787
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,559
workflows it would publish as long as it

788
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,840
had any workflow complete effect it was

789
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,919
just a tag required checkbox this is

790
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,120
looking for

791
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,559
workflow State complete the specific tag

792
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,140
and if it doesn't have that tag it's

793
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,039
going to add a tag workflow to do ad

794
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,200
tagging it's part of the workflow

795
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,500
taxonomy that's maintained by Circle

796
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,480
and then it's also going to add a tag

797
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,179
for workflow rejected

798
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,340
so you know you you've pushed the

799
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,720
publish button

800
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,880
but this does take a second it's got to

801
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,260
write to the database it's got to go

802
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,360
through zmq

803
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,419
it's a block or not block

804
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,460
you've moved on

805
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,779
you know you're doing something else now

806
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,760
you're on the next event whatever

807
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,919
how you how are you going to know that

808
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,299
something was blocked and you got to go

809
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,100
back and fix it so it's going to add

810
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,620
that workflow rejected tag so that you

811
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,320
know something broke or something's not

812
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,820
right and then it's going to stop

813
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,100
execution of the workflow and it's on a

814
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,200
canvas you can drag and drop you can

815
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,860
even save it for later and add to it

816
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,159
so here is an event we created and has

817
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,740
no tags except for tlb clear I'm going

818
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,279
to publish it

819
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,419
wait a little bit for all the magic to

820
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,140
happen in the background

821
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,460
nope

822
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,640
there you go added tags I need to add

823
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,460
some tags and I need to

824
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,440
and I see that it's rejected so I remove

825
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,820
those tags

826
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,620
I went through my curation process again

827
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,480
made sure everything was right and now

828
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,039
I'm adding the workflow complete tag

829
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,080
I've done my job I went through my

830
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,360
playbook I'm done

831
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,000
now I'm going to publish it again

832
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,640
the same process saving to the database

833
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,159
publishing to zmq

834
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,200
workflows triggered

835
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,279
but

836
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,500
workflow is satisfied because it sees

837
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,480
the tag it's supposed to see and now the

838
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,279
event is published

839
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,620
now that is a simple

840
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,200
workflow demonstration there's multiple

841
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,059
triggers as you can see there and

842
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:33,419
multiple modules that can trigger when

843
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,220
you try to do an enrichment

844
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,620
trigger when

845
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,480
um

846
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,140
I'd have to look at the list again but

847
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,779
any type of transaction you do in this

848
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:47,880
can be a trigger for a workflow to Fire

849
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,460
and then you can add tags you can

850
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,679
publish it to a web hook so you want

851
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:55,500
teams or slack notification to go off

852
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,179
you can do all types of things within

853
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:01,039
the workflows for misp

854
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,679
so

855
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,899
after all this what did we learn from

856
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,060
doing all of this work

857
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,679
tooling

858
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,719
you need to make sure that whatever you

859
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,599
create is customized to the way you work

860
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,879
you're going to find stuff on GitHub

861
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,099
you're going to find stuff on blogs that

862
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,080
say do it this way do it that way make

863
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,960
sure you take a look at how you do it

864
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,239
now what your requirements are what your

865
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,599
playbook is and make sure you don't just

866
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,280
copy and paste oh we're going to do it

867
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,440
this way now because this guy on GitHub

868
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,580
this is the way he does it so we're

869
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,020
going to do it like this make sure it's

870
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,359
customized to your organization

871
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,879
automate as much as possible

872
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,560
that's obvious

873
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,960
and then extend what is available

874
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,000
don't always go looking for the next

875
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,040
shiny thing that you see in a blog post

876
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,980
a lot of the tools you have within your

877
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,739
own organization now have capabilities

878
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,420
to help you

879
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,580
accomplish your goals maybe that switch

880
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,280
just isn't flipped or the the guy who

881
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,140
owns that tool didn't turn to that page

882
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,119
in the manual because he's his use case

883
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,460
is over here and it's done but it also

884
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,680
has other capabilities don't be afraid

885
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,940
to question what you already have

886
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,500
next up is everyone's favorite topic as

887
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,740
a lesson learned documentation

888
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,680
yes it is important if you want to run

889
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,020
out now now is your chance no

890
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,660
documentation it is important you have

891
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,160
to realize when you're setting up

892
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,380
something like this

893
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,420
you will probably not be the person

894
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,000
maintaining this until the end of its

895
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,839
days

896
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,240
there's going to be someone else

897
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,220
I hope for all of you that from time to

898
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,440
time you take some vacation and someone

899
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,660
else can take over from you so you need

900
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,880
to document first of all the

901
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,859
architecture as we've seen our

902
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,900
architecture fairly simple we have four

903
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,720
systems we need to document that we need

904
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,119
to document all of the different flows

905
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:02,640
between those systems that if someone

906
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
else comes in in a few years maybe and I

907
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,079
hope it's still running within a few

908
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,720
years that we well proven to ourselves

909
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,520
that it actually works for a longer

910
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,960
period of time

911
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,700
um but if someone comes in in a few

912
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,680
years and they want to make changes they

913
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,480
need to make certain changes they need

914
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
to understand what the current workflows

915
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,400
are how those different misps are

916
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,380
communicating to each other so you need

917
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,680
to have that documented there as well

918
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,540
also understand and we've seen that we

919
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,300
do lots of Automation in it we try to do

920
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,859
as much automation but there's always

921
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,260
the part that the analyst needs to do

922
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,000
there's still the analysts that needs to

923
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,339
do a final validation need to add

924
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:43,859
something needs to add some miter tags

925
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,839
there as well so make sure that all of

926
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,760
that is documented as well we try to

927
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,740
build in some sales like Robert just

928
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,079
showed we built in some fail sales that

929
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:53,460
if you didn't go through your entire

930
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,200
checklist you probably forgot that

931
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,599
attack workflow complete okay if that

932
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,920
happens we're not going to publish

933
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,180
because there's probably something else

934
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,119
that you also forgot so document that

935
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,339
entire process as well how do you do

936
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,500
curation what are the different actions

937
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,180
that you need to take how can you do

938
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,579
certain things so documentation yes

939
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,700
absolutely it is very important

940
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,480
another thing that we all love so much

941
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,000
is communication

942
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
talking to your stakeholders talking to

943
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,099
your peers

944
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,859
as much as we want to Pat ourselves on

945
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,240
the back and say we're doing an awesome

946
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,000
job here saying ah we're we're doing all

947
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,300
this curation and we have zero false

948
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,180
positives over the last six months it's

949
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,700
like sure but you also only gave us like

950
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,560
one indicator of compromise over the

951
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,020
last six months good job to you so you

952
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,420
need to have an interaction there what

953
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,060
do you get from us do you get value from

954
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,520
the feed then specifically from the ioc

955
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,400
feed do you get value from it talk to

956
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,560
the people that you work with that you

957
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,140
work for ask them do you okay do you

958
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,820
have false positives if you have false

959
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,800
positives you likely hear them say it

960
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,140
but also understand do you have true

961
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,000
positives do you actually have hits on

962
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
the data does it help you does it help

963
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,440
your clients does it help your

964
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,540
organization so you really need to talk

965
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,700
to them understand what their current

966
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,640
pain points are with the deliverable

967
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,920
that you bring to them do you have pain

968
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,020
points how can we solve this how can we

969
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,940
make this better together so

970
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,339
communication definitely really really

971
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:33,000
important something we must do uh very

972
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,920
often continuously let's say

973
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,660
like I said this is not done yet for us

974
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,460
we still have a number of things on our

975
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,280
roadmap one of those things is that misp

976
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,859
workflow as Robert said still embed in

977
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:49,079
the the beta stages very early it's been

978
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,060
released over the summer now

979
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,099
um so the workflows themselves they're

980
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:55,560
still rather Limited in what they can do

981
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,380
our goal is to have all of those scripts

982
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,280
that we now custom created for ourselves

983
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,960
that we can transform those into

984
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,240
workflows might be necessary that we

985
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,060
create those workflows ourselves uh that

986
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,859
we created the the underlying scripts

987
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,599
for that ourselves that can that also

988
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,000
feedback to Circle we'll need to see how

989
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,579
we do that uh but that's it would make

990
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,680
it a bit easier to also share back with

991
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,900
the community and I'll get back to that

992
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,160
one in a bit as well

993
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,380
um contributing back to the community so

994
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,060
we want to

995
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,820
help other organizations know that they

996
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,400
have a bad ioc in their feed instead of

997
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,740
just blocking them we want to contribute

998
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,380
sightings for things we've seen we want

999
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,660
to share our resources and how we

1000
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,220
matured our processes so we're starting

1001
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,800
there sharing how we've matured our

1002
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,020
threat intelligence process

1003
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,359
but with the curation we want to make

1004
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,520
sure we're at a level where we're when

1005
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,500
we share back we don't want to be one of

1006
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,880
those organizations that possibly share

1007
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,820
but something that is makes a lot of

1008
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,099
headache but that is one of our goals is

1009
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,260
to be able to share back with the

1010
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,020
community on a attribute event level

1011
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,119
announcements so we did have a plan to

1012
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,740
create a custom script that did

1013
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,960
announcements to teams and slack

1014
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,859
Etc

1015
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,740
well miss helped us with that so with

1016
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,780
the workflow feature now we're going to

1017
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,839
look at the web hook capabilities and

1018
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,579
maybe we don't have to log into the Miss

1019
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,140
every day at nine o'clock to see if

1020
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,099
there's an event that needs to be

1021
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,619
curated we'll set up a web hook workflow

1022
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,140
that says ping and tell him unless you

1023
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,700
got an event with a workflow tag and

1024
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,779
complete you need to go take a look

1025
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,180
and then finally open sourcing

1026
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,280
everything that we've made so it's our

1027
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,200
goal also to all the scripts that we

1028
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,060
created again as I mentioned they're

1029
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,880
very custom to us right now if you want

1030
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,800
to use this within your organization you

1031
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,940
probably need to make them very custom

1032
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,820
to your organization but by the end of

1033
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,680
the year at the latest we need to do

1034
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,240
some cleanup on the scripts we'll be

1035
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,280
honest with that maybe also add some

1036
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,380
documentation either own dog food over

1037
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,240
there

1038
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,800
but we will open source that we'll put

1039
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,900
that on our GitHub the link to our

1040
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,940
GitHub which is uh which is here and

1041
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,099
then share it back and hopefully you can

1042
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,040
use that within your organizations then

1043
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,839
as well

1044
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,599
that was it for us thanks a lot for your

1045
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,339
attention and for being here and if you

1046
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,200
have any questions we'd be happy to

1047
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,510
answer them

1048
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:35,940
[Applause]

1049
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,760
are there any questions who has some

1050
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,940
questions

1051
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
nobody has a question that means it was

1052
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,640
all very clear

1053
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,240
that's Friday all right

1054
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,540
so uh yeah thank you very much and maybe

1055
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,579
