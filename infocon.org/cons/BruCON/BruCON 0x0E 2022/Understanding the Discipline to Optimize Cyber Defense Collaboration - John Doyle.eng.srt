1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,460
my talk is designed to really help

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,140
familiarize

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,820
cyber Security Professionals with the

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,580
Cyber threat intelligence discipline by

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,559
Design what we're trying to cover here

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,120
should roughly take about a half hour

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,580
now I realize we are in a bit of a

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,220
precarious position uh I stand between

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,439
you and a coffee break

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,660
which is probably the second worst thing

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,939
from standing between you and lunch or

12
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,460
you in a beer break

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,679
now either way with that in mind what

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,120
I'll try and do is I'll try and keep

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,340
this pretty concise I'll keep this down

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,760
to about 30 or 40 minutes

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,379
if we can we can entertain some

18
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,620
questions here given the live stream

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,700
nature of this I'm not sure that we'll

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,079
be able to however

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,539
if we can are happy to accommodate if

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,800
not I'm happy to answer questions

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,739
offline we can chat on Twitter or any of

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,480
the social media platforms

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,460
and hopefully at some point I'll get a

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,680
chance to meet all of you in person

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
so we'll go ahead and we'll get started

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,039
here

29
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,420
um before I get started with the

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,400
presentation just natural kind of

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,520
disclaimer all of the content presented

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,159
in here is my own it represents my own

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,200
views not that of my employer

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
I will as you see throughout the

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,140
presentation talk about one of an the

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,640
interesting projects that I was able to

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,220
create which is a framework that andient

38
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,380
published that I was able to publish on

39
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,140
behalf of mandiant so we'll use that as

40
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,159
kind of a baseline to help us understand

41
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,680
how some of the different skills play

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,380
various roles into connecting and

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,600
helping us understand and work better

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,299
together as a collective Defense Force

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,400
in cyber security

46
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,119
you'll also find that about me I tend to

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,340
tell stories so a lot of what you'll

48
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,320
find in this presentation deck is

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,020
derivative of my personality experiences

50
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,420
that I've lived through uh the type of

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,479
humor that I have it should resonate I

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,220
think with a lot of you so if you see

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,320
some Easter eggs in here that's cool

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,780
it's part of the whole uh plan it's by

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,960
Design

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,599
so a quick

57
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,620
agenda of what we're going to cover here

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,020
I'll spend just a few minutes talking

59
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,840
about myself who I am uh how I kind of

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,459
came to be in this field and what I've

61
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,700
learned we'll talk a little bit about

62
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,220
the cyber security field its nature how

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,840
cyber threat intelligence plays a role

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,819
in it we'll talk about the various

65
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,800
stakeholders so I'll spend a decent

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,000
amount of time

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,520
talking through what we actually do in

68
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,620
cyber threat intelligence because I feel

69
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,300
like there's often a misunderstanding

70
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,099
about that

71
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,420
um there's a lot of different roles

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,580
there's a lot of different deliverables

73
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,420
that we end up creating and oftentimes

74
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,280
what I found in working with various

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,860
different cyber security teams is

76
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,420
they think uh one thing and it's perhaps

77
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,819
not representative of the whole

78
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,620
and then we'll talk about the framework

79
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,720
I created this cyber threat intelligence

80
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,879
analyst core competencies and what

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,019
you'll see is

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,360
once we get to that point we'll be able

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,060
to break down the different components

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,580
the different constituent pieces

85
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,700
that various animals have now I have

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,519
some use cases that I will bring up one

87
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,260
of which is to use this to help us

88
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,500
better collaborate as teams there are

89
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,900
also other use cases as well such as

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,060
used as to build roadmaps to grow your

91
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,340
analysts Workforce

92
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,019
and that'll give you some parting

93
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:35,879
thoughts and hopefully we can get the Q

94
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,180
a uh working here but if not again happy

95
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,400
to entertain those questions on social

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,700
media or other platforms

97
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,379
so who am I

98
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,260
a drink and I know things

99
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,060
um so I'm John Doyle

100
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,940
I live in Colorado we are out here in

101
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Belgium which is probably comparable as

102
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,620
far as beer is concerned so I've been in

103
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,239
digital forensics or cyber threat

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
intelligence for about 15 years at this

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,940
point

106
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,680
I started out working at a computer

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,440
repair shop kind of doing help desk

108
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,239
stuff like I think a lot of us in this

109
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,519
profession did

110
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,340
from there I kind of navigated my way up

111
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,519
and found a very Niche Focus I spent 10

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,858
years working for the CIA that was kind

113
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,800
of interesting I know a lot about North

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,460
Korea Russia and various different

115
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,160
nation-state side reactor programs

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,500
um what I've learned there I'll kind of

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,240
capture through some of my experiences

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,639
as we talk about the framework itself

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,160
about how the profession has developed

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,380
at some point in time I realized that I

121
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,840
reached the senior ranks and I wasn't

122
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,300
really doing what I intended to do when

123
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,979
I kind of joined this profession which

124
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,360
was give back

125
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,979
helped broaden the community now I was

126
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,320
doing some really good work helping with

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,759
National Security interests and whatnot

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,580
but I wasn't being able to give back in

129
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,199
an effective manner so at that point in

130
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,060
time I started teaching I started doing

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,360
instruction and facilitation so I worked

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,340
at an academic institution concurrently

133
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,280
and that has been gratifying for a whole

134
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,020
host of different reasons

135
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,419
here I am at mandiant I've served in a

136
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,680
few different roles at this point in

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,139
time I've done the analytic thing I

138
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,380
understand our practices I took kind of

139
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,620
a Out of Body Experience where I

140
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,660
was a strategic consultant

141
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,600
actually going out evaluating building

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,639
solutioning

143
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,479
um

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,500
various different programs that existed

145
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,240
identifying areas of weakness and

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,979
providing recommendations for helping

147
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,800
programs actually grow to various states

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,300
of maturity

149
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,979
where I am now is actually an

150
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,979
intelligence consultant so it Blends

151
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,560
those two worlds together quite nicely

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,720
often I'm asked to go out work with

153
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,460
clients various cyber threat

154
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,580
intelligence teams or

155
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,580
the stock function or the cisos and help

156
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,740
them understand where they are

157
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,360
help them understand how intelligence

158
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,639
plugs in how they can build a capability

159
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,380
uplift their people design around their

160
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,360
various Mission mandates that they have

161
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
in place

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,620
so a lot of what you'll see here is

163
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,180
going to kind of come out in the form of

164
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,280
you know this framework a lot of the

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
Lessons Learned take into account the

166
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,240
various experiences and exposures that

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
I've been able to afford uh it's been

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,300
quite nice

169
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,819
um I also teach for Sans so again kind

170
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,160
of going along with the helping Build

171
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,039
and Grow the next

172
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,580
generation of professionals I find this

173
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,599
work very gratifying

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,520
a good starting point though is to

175
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,340
understand where we come from right what

176
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,039
we all do and how that plays a role in

177
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,080
the collective Mission mandate

178
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,940
cyber threat intelligence we sometimes

179
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,280
call this the common operating picture a

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
common frame of reference is just

181
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,539
another way to call this out

182
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,780
and ultimately what we're trying to do

183
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,759
is focus on one of a few different

184
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,039
things right help bolster Collective

185
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,600
defenses whether that's prevention

186
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,500
detection or remediation efforts or also

187
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,960
look at risk exposure decisions

188
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,599
so I like to use the ooda loop as a good

189
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,419
Exemplar to kind of talk through what

190
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,340
that actually means for those of you not

191
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,259
familiar with the oodle Loop this is a

192
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,419
construct developed by the US Air Force

193
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,900
a gentleman named John Boyd and it's

194
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,940
consists of four different parts

195
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,400
the first part there and the most

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,919
important part is observe before making

197
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,080
any decisions Collective defense or

198
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,900
otherwise you need situational awareness

199
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,639
you need lay of the land

200
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,620
lay of the land comes from those direct

201
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,900
observations in our environment that is

202
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,599
looking at our logs looking at different

203
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,840
types of intrusion activities

204
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,639
only then can we make effective

205
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,220
decisions so where I like to start the

206
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,319
conversation out here is

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,740
we all are trying to accomplish very

208
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,139
similar things at a high level it all

209
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,780
rolls up to a particular one two three

210
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,180
four different Mission mandates

211
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,099
the oodle Loop

212
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,259
when we're working together we can

213
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,539
actually run around the ooda loop a lot

214
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,639
quicker together a lot quicker than our

215
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,020
adversaries who have their own noodle

216
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,039
loops

217
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,500
so in a way

218
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,780
the collective defense Mission mandate

219
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,020
we have will allow us to

220
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,179
find Synergy find collaboration

221
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,760
opportunities and be able to outpace

222
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
adversaries

223
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
and that's where intelligence really

224
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,839
kind of shines

225
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,700
there's been a few different iterations

226
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,000
of identification of roles that exist

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,339
within this field I've been in it for 15

228
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,860
years at this point I've seen various

229
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,620
jobs called out much like most of you I

230
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,660
think the nist framework does a really

231
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,480
good job identifying what those various

232
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,160
roles are

233
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,839
they break them down into these various

234
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,399
categories here

235
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,620
so under the nist nice cyber security

236
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,480
Workforce framework you can see it's

237
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,420
broken out into uh seven different

238
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,100
categories

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,320
and it actually breaks out the roles and

240
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,480
functions for them into knowledge skills

241
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,620
and ability competencies

242
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,060
Sans has taken this one step further and

243
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,880
they've actually listed out a mapping

244
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,120
that roughly aligns within reason of

245
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
where the different roles fall

246
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,220
So based on those knowledge skills and

247
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,019
abilities what the different types of

248
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,640
job roles in cyber security look like

249
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,660
when we're thinking about

250
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,000
cyber threat intelligence though we have

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,220
kind of a broad Mission mandate and our

252
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,899
goal at the end of the day is to be a

253
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:56,339
service organization

254
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,860
we are here to support you

255
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,800
so when asked what would you say you do

256
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,519
here

257
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,680
the answer is not I take the

258
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,660
requirements from the client to the

259
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,120
engineers it's well we work hand in

260
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
glove right we look at threats we

261
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
understand the threats we understand

262
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,779
capabilities we understand risk we

263
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,540
understand alignment so when we are

264
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
thinking through you know what does

265
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,620
threat actually mean

266
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,600
the standard convention we tend to use

267
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,399
in this field is threat as a function of

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,500
three different things

269
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,959
adversary intentions

270
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,540
their opportunity or are exposed attack

271
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,240
surface and the capabilities

272
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
so understanding adversary motivations

273
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,120
so here you can see I've used a very

274
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,980
popular meme these days to kind of

275
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,560
describe that CTI analyst provides

276
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,320
timely relevant actionable insights on

277
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
threat actors capabilities motivations

278
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,320
to inform risk exposure decisions in

279
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,079
cyber defense actions

280
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,899
is really important that I footstomp

281
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,519
that last point

282
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,180
because sometimes it's very easy to just

283
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,459
think of cyber threat intelligence as a

284
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,980
function of cyber defense and not put it

285
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,220
into the more holistic context of

286
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,339
informing risk exposure decisions yeah

287
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,200
most of you are on the practitioner

288
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,579
tactician side

289
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,100
either building designing implementing

290
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,100
remediating

291
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,279
what we try and do

292
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,839
obviously is you know you are the action

293
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,260
or the action arm that we are supporting

294
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,839
the way we break that out

295
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,760
is into three different audience types

296
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,920
so Ross and The Cyber threat

297
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,540
intelligence profession

298
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
we're looking at

299
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,180
three different broad categories and you

300
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,860
probably find yourself on one of these

301
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,560
three strategic operational or tactical

302
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,600
you might call you stakeholder we might

303
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,060
call you a customer all of these words

304
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,800
mean the same thing they're all

305
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,019
synonymous in our parlance this is how

306
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,019
we communicate with ourselves when we

307
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,880
think about this though right you can

308
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,980
naturally see some alignment

309
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,079
one of the nice things about cyber

310
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,700
threat intelligence is we create

311
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,519
Frameworks Frameworks help us

312
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,399
provide a mental model that mental model

313
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,440
allows us to then do things with it

314
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
whether that's

315
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,880
helping devise new solutioning help

316
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,459
bucket our thought process help explain

317
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,279
to various customers what our thoughts

318
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,180
are

319
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,860
so when we're looking at strategic

320
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,140
operational and tactical chances are you

321
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,120
fall on one of these three right we've

322
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,700
created this overarching framework

323
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,959
strategic level is exactly what you

324
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,500
think typically analysts who are strong

325
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,139
on the Strategic side tend to be able to

326
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,540
understand the threat landscape they can

327
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,639
quickly understand

328
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,160
how a certain event whether it's an

329
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,600
internal Trigger or something that's

330
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,300
externally reported actually plays into

331
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,480
the broader risk apparatus right how

332
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,959
does this affect us does it affect us is

333
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,220
this something we need to worry about

334
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,019
what's the priority level or

335
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,660
prioritization we should put on it and

336
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,519
the typical stakeholders tend to fall

337
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,380
across that spectrum of your c-suite

338
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,260
Executives your risk management Folk

339
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,940
when you get to the operational side

340
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,019
this is more kind of what we'd expect to

341
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,680
see in terms of the response arm so our

342
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,660
sock colleagues our incident responders

343
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,540
um

344
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,940
this is where we do things like tracking

345
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,459
adversary capabilities tracking actor

346
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,740
intents tracking their motivations being

347
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,320
able to identify the different ttps that

348
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,639
they're using

349
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,680
in order to be successful in their

350
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
operations across

351
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,660
the various

352
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,160
campaigns that they're undertaking

353
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,440
tactical gets more to you know our sock

354
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
support directly creating iocs creating

355
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,940
detection signatures that are going to

356
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,860
be relevant and useful things that we

357
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,300
can push towards security controls

358
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,040
so the question begs okay well tell me

359
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,320
about you know with red analysts tell me

360
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,820
about a cyber threat intelligence

361
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,899
professional

362
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,959
clearly there's just one job title

363
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,420
no there's there's not um I hate to

364
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,339
break that to you when we think of the

365
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,279
when we think of the composition there

366
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,779
is actually a lot of titles that exist

367
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,959
out there and based on the various

368
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,339
titles based on the roles and

369
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,380
responsibilities you'll find variants in

370
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,200
the people who fill those now this

371
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,639
doesn't even get into the discussion

372
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,500
about is this a junior person is this a

373
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,019
senior person what's the variance in

374
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,139
level of knowledge and ability

375
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,980
um instead it is a starting point it is

376
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,139
a starting point for a conversation so

377
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,540
when you are engaging with your threat

378
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,180
analysts Cadre when you're engaging with

379
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,120
the various CTI cells that exist this

380
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,940
ends up being a point in which you can

381
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,040
start to ask probing questions to

382
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,540
understand what that level of

383
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,220
familiarity looks like

384
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,160
so me personally I work more on the

385
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,680
operational and strategic side I've

386
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,500
learned myself over time I'm actually

387
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,420
pretty decent not explaining things and

388
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,240
putting it into you know big picture so

389
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
I find myself being asked in most cases

390
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,740
to do strategic stuff even though my

391
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,440
passion lies in tracking adversaries and

392
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,260
trying to impose pain on them

393
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,480
what you will find though is based on

394
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,500
each of these roles there's

395
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,839
specialization

396
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:37,019
and as the field has evolved as cyber

397
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,940
security has evolved right back in the

398
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,680
day we had information assurance then

399
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,300
information security and now we have

400
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,000
cyber security right each of these has

401
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,940
their own specific slant and those

402
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,399
Slants have various

403
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,399
expertise embedded inside of them that

404
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,600
we can leverage and we can use

405
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
at the heart of it though everything

406
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,180
that we do on the CTI side is predicated

407
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,959
on some baseline things you know those

408
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
Baseline things are what we call

409
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
intelligence requirements

410
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,339
so you as our stakeholders provide us

411
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,040
with a listing of use cases

412
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,019
you say use cases we say intelligence

413
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,180
requirements tomato

414
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,160
we take those intelligence requirements

415
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,800
from you and the other stakeholders and

416
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,639
we identify and prioritize we create a

417
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,620
list

418
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,740
we create how these actually

419
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,839
fit into the grand scheme of things and

420
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,320
we create a production Matrix right so

421
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,820
we are using what's called an

422
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,500
intelligent cycle you can see that

423
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,360
denoted on the left here

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
with this circular diagram and we're

425
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,560
using our intelligence requirements our

426
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,139
framework here to understand how we can

427
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,380
support

428
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,220
I won't go through the examples I'm sure

429
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,680
you're reading those on the screen

430
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,259
but you can see things like

431
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,880
understanding adversary ttps that are

432
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,099
targeting us that are targeting our

433
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,559
industry pairs that is a high priority

434
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,660
want to know that from a strategic level

435
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,799
we also want to know that from a

436
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,540
tactical level to ensure that we have

437
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,400
detections in place

438
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,020
to ensure that we're actually tracking

439
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,240
these groups such that when a breach

440
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,400
does happen we are prepared for it such

441
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,559
that we are investing our resources in a

442
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,720
way that is effective and makes the most

443
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,679
sense for the organization

444
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,460
one of the things I find a lot of our

445
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,100
peers in the various cyber security

446
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,559
disciplines don't understand what we do

447
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,000
is this we actually have listings of

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
tools and data sets that we use broken

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,380
down so it's not just the full

450
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,539
enumeration of fields right I know you

451
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,640
can get that from a SIM

452
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,460
what we actually do here though is we

453
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,039
rack and stack and we keep a listing of

454
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,780
our tallies we keep a listing of our

455
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,940
tools to the listing of our data sets

456
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,220
and what benefit they provide us

457
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,780
we call this a collection management

458
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,400
framework sometimes it's referred to as

459
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,900
a collection plan

460
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,179
I've seen this broken out into a few

461
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:10,799
different ways

462
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,600
this first one you can see at the top of

463
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,039
your screen here

464
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,620
tends to be a kind of generic one like

465
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,679
let me just do an X Y axis let me list

466
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
out the tools let me enumerate all the

467
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,820
things we get and then I can make a cost

468
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,400
comparison or I could do Gap analysis

469
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,620
it's helpful and this is for external

470
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,120
tools that's as you can see you could do

471
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,660
this with internal data sets as well

472
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,820
where I find the most utility in

473
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,320
creating something like a collection

474
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,840
plan though is this bottom left

475
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,260
actually aligning you know various tools

476
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,080
various vendor feeds and stuff to the

477
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,179
intelligence requirements at hand and

478
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,860
then doing a prioritization whether it's

479
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,440
a medium high

480
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,020
confidence level certain percentage Etc

481
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,820
that tends to be where a lot of

482
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,320
organizations tend to get the most bang

483
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,880
for their Buck at least on the CTI side

484
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,160
when they're trying to do metrics to

485
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,260
evaluate the effectiveness

486
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,880
of

487
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,340
the year of what they're paying for of

488
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,900
where their finite resources are

489
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,980
actually going

490
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,559
and in some cases you can see like on

491
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,419
the right hand side if you are looking

492
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,080
at various groups if that is in

493
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,059
intelligence requirement more granular

494
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,700
let me look specifically at the groups

495
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,740
in this particular case you know I care

496
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,500
a lot about Russian sets so I've

497
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,360
enumerated all the Russian sets I've

498
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,059
enumerated all of the various vendors

499
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,640
that we use to be able to get a more

500
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,039
deliberate view of the threat picture

501
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,320
from these groups and you know I just

502
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,620
did a binary yes no so there's a lot of

503
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,200
different ways in which collection plans

504
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,960
can be created however

505
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,000
what I've noted in this is again I'm

506
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,559
going to foot stomp this point because I

507
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,720
was working with uh

508
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,539
client recently and like we brought

509
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,220
their IR team in we brought their sock

510
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,320
in we brought their CTI team in they had

511
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,299
no idea we kept this information they

512
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,460
had no idea that we could keep this type

513
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,380
of a framework because it's particularly

514
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,700
useful especially when we're thinking

515
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,860
about resource decisions making joint

516
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,840
justification for buying licenses for

517
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
various tools

518
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,580
or various vendor feeds right we can

519
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,860
make a more compelling use case when we

520
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,559
actually have it enumerated

521
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,980
um this is a function that CTI has a

522
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,559
cell is responsible for doing

523
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,460
all right so let's actually talk about

524
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,559
what we do right those were some kind of

525
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,360
high level cyber threat intelligence

526
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,740
stuffs

527
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,860
so uh you know on the left hand side the

528
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,260
kind of the profession has grown from

529
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,640
either two different tracks it's either

530
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
grown from traditional intelligence

531
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,780
analysis whether it's military analysis

532
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,140
economic analysis looking at different

533
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,700
signals intelligence things of that

534
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
nature or cyber Security Professionals

535
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,039
now the left here when you're thinking

536
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
about the intelligence track right they

537
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,419
tend to be generalists right they are

538
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,940
the Jack Ryan they think they

539
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,039
um they have the ability to take in a

540
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,539
lot of information have really good

541
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:11,760
working memory and really good recall be

542
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,080
able to present that in a way that's

543
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,179
meaningful to those stakeholders

544
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,880
on the right hand side here coming from

545
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,340
kind of the cyber security track

546
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,600
especially on the incident response side

547
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,179
We've Got Deep technical expertise so

548
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,640
variance there from generalization

549
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,380
um you know we are very clever sometimes

550
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,559
to our own detriments right you can see

551
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,539
the I.T crowd meme that I've got going

552
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,340
on here

553
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,299
um we have the ability to go down and

554
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,580
understand at a technical level what

555
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,679
this means and whether it is something

556
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,299
that we need to care about or it's

557
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,860
something that we can put on the back

558
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,520
burner so when you're looking at the

559
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
combination of the two the development

560
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,080
of the discipline here that we call

561
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,059
cyber threat intelligence

562
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,460
you end up with an amalgam

563
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,980
you get individuals who are really good

564
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,140
at being able to present and adapt their

565
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,260
audiences who are really effective at

566
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,140
being able to understand the technical

567
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,539
information being presented add some

568
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,980
contextual overlays and be able to put

569
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,679
that into terms in which the business

570
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,120
where the stakeholders understand

571
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,120
foreign

572
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,260
so when we're thinking about

573
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
how we can leverage cyber threat

574
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,100
intelligence

575
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,840
there's a lot of different things we can

576
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,559
do

577
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,480
sometimes it's acting as that

578
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,919
translation layer

579
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,220
it is being able to tell a compelling

580
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,260
story something that our more technical

581
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,900
colleagues sometimes you know it's just

582
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,600
not their strong suit

583
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,100
we can leverage and contextualize

584
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,440
information understand the different

585
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,740
motivations of different actor sets

586
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,780
understand the internal posture of the

587
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,400
organization for how we can go about

588
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,460
doing response or defensive efforts

589
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,419
excuse me

590
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,320
and then also be able to help our

591
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,760
stakeholders arrive at various

592
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,380
conclusions provide the intelligent

593
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,840
support they need in order to run

594
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,720
through that ooda Loop in a much faster

595
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,140
pace

596
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,039
so that leads us to this framework that

597
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,039
I created on behalf of mandian

598
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,799
we publish it in May it's called The

599
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,840
Cyber thread intelligence analyst core

600
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,100
competencies

601
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,400
we did a lot of introspection we worked

602
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,039
with industry we worked with internal

603
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,039
folks to develop it and the question

604
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,640
that I asked when we started this is

605
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,039
I've seen this profession grow over time

606
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,419
what

607
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,539
based on today's standards are that

608
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,159
knowledge skills and abilities that are

609
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,000
needed to be effective in this

610
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,440
particular

611
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,480
job discipline

612
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,440
and what I arrived at is it depends

613
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,460
because there is no singular

614
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,760
um job title or job role that can be

615
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,220
defined here but there are some common

616
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,679
traits there are some common traits that

617
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,780
are shared that we can work to Growing

618
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,039
towards

619
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,299
so

620
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:39,179
at a high level the framework actually

621
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,179
helps solve three different problems

622
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,580
you can see here today I'm talking about

623
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,760
one specific subset of them

624
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,740
and

625
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,860
that one in particular is understanding

626
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,140
what we do like what what what's

627
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,659
expected like who who we are what our

628
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:00,120
skills are to understand how we can

629
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,280
better leverage one another either

630
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,059
through uh response efforts

631
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,340
got an ongoing investigation or we've

632
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,340
got an alert that pops how can you help

633
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,620
me have we seen this before what are the

634
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,940
questions you can ask what are the

635
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,200
skills that are there

636
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,700
so when we're thinking about the

637
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,740
framework itself I've broken it out into

638
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,200
four different pillars those pillars are

639
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,360
listed at the top here problem solving

640
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,460
personal Effectiveness technical

641
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,520
literacy and cyber threat proficiency

642
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,620
under each of those there's three

643
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,960
different competencies I won't read them

644
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,980
all

645
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,140
but I will point out that this is the

646
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,240
way we've kind of broken it down in the

647
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,520
framework itself

648
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,559
this was not just a me initiative I

649
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,480
happen to lead it and then I went to

650
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,940
some trusted soundboards and then I

651
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,059
released it a little more broadly so in

652
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,580
a way what I was trying to do is

653
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,159
create something that ends up being kind

654
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,740
of like the miter attack framework a

655
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,140
full enumeration of all of the different

656
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,080
things that we could be asked to do

657
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,080
in a overarching mental model that

658
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,720
allows me to characterize and Define it

659
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,539
now on the left hand side the problem

660
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,940
solving and personal Effectiveness these

661
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,100
are things we kind of already have we

662
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,320
can work towards right these are

663
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,500
encompassing of our thought process our

664
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,620
abilities are innate thoughts

665
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,940
um our social skills our self-awareness

666
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,760
the other two on the right hand side can

667
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,340
be learned over time so technical

668
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,919
literacy where cyber threat intelligence

669
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,799
tend to shine and stand out usually more

670
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,539
so than some of our peers is

671
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,419
understanding the fact the Cyber threat

672
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,240
Concepts so this tends to be our bread

673
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,460
and butter so I will spend a lot of time

674
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
talking about that as I walk you through

675
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,919
what each of these entails in the next

676
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,640
few slides

677
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,480
I don't expect you to read all of this

678
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
I've included here just as a quick

679
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,960
breakdown

680
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,840
right problem solving has three

681
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,539
overarching competencies critical

682
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,880
thinking research and Analysis and the

683
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,159
investigative mindset the end of the day

684
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,779
you need to be passionate to be

685
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,240
effective in this field you need to have

686
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,940
Natural Curiosity and passion that's

687
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,120
often how I referred to it the ability

688
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,340
to kind of arrive at right conclusions

689
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
understand when we're going down

690
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,940
Pathways that are wrong or somehow

691
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,200
inherently biased

692
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,520
you know understand that we might not

693
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,679
have all of the right information but we

694
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:42,299
know that data sets are the tools to go

695
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,520
to where we can start to do enrichment

696
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,500
and enumeration and then how we can

697
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,900
actually piece all of that together

698
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,460
understanding the utility and

699
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,900
limitations of various different

700
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,080
indicators of compromise

701
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,340
knowing the mental models that exist

702
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,640
knowing the data sets and then really uh

703
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,679
you know I think a lot of you

704
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,360
naturally have this and there's a lot

705
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,559
come on last presentation too

706
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,440
investigative mindset right how do I

707
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,480
know where to go next how do I

708
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,279
understand where I should be poking

709
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,240
around

710
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
that's just that's the passion part

711
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,679
let's solve it in the problem and a lot

712
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:17,580
of the

713
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,039
the best CTI analysts that I've come

714
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,640
across have that Natural Curiosity

715
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,159
in a way we're kind of like

716
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,559
trying to be Sherlock Holmes

717
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,120
not very different than incident

718
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,880
responders trying to figure out where we

719
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,860
go next what's the next thing we need to

720
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,900
do constantly asking that question of

721
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,620
why why

722
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,779
if you didn't want to read all that I

723
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,760
kind of broke it down here this is just

724
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
a quick summary

725
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,799
it allows you to understand what we were

726
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,799
trying to convey why logic and reasoning

727
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,640
considers needs for various stakeholders

728
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,880
various entities

729
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,740
understands unique fingerprints

730
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,620
can mine interpret stored data pivot on

731
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,120
things

732
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,159
and then really

733
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,679
devise novel Solutions based on all of

734
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,380
this so if there's not already an

735
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,240
existing solution in place we can create

736
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,860
one

737
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,419
and sometimes that's a framework

738
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,480
sometimes it's a data schema

739
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,100
um it all depends based on what we're

740
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,000
working on

741
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,980
really helps us get to the answering the

742
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,380
questions of our stakeholders of what we

743
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,000
actually need to do to be effective

744
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,600
as we move to the next pillar

745
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,940
we've got personal effectiveness

746
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,039
now it's interesting I was working with

747
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,620
our HR component in our Learning and

748
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,299
Development component kind of talking to

749
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,580
them about this I just wanted to you

750
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,080
know as we were creating it socialize

751
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,919
the idea and uh the feedback I got was

752
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,260
yeah you've kind of Taken like the high

753
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,240
level fluffiness of soft skills and

754
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,860
actually made it applicable to your

755
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,720
field

756
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,460
um which in a way was kind of a

757
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,620
backhanded compliment but I laughed and

758
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,600
really took it as a positive knot

759
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,740
something of the Court

760
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,299
when we're thinking about personal

761
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:14,940
Effectiveness there's three different

762
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,480
competencies that I felt were important

763
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,940
communication teamwork and emotional

764
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,159
intelligence and business acumen

765
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,440
the last one I'm going to hit on quite a

766
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,419
bit because it's something that gets

767
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,760
lost so often in CTI

768
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,279
we get so caught up in the Tactical

769
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:35,220
day-to-day we sometimes lose sight of

770
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,899
the big picture

771
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:39,299
communication though

772
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,240
comes in a few different forms if I

773
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,700
cannot communicate with you as my

774
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,860
stakeholder

775
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,159
in a way that's effective that resonates

776
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:52,140
then what I'm doing is going to have

777
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,520
minimal impact

778
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,919
and at the end of the day as a service

779
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,820
entity my goal is to have maximal impact

780
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,100
so I need to understand you I need to

781
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,360
understand what you do I need to

782
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,100
understand who you are

783
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,080
that sounds kind of a little creepy as I

784
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,059
say it out loud here but it's really

785
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,279
important I need to understand your job

786
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,279
role and hopefully based on this you can

787
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,200
understand like the CTI function itself

788
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,120
too

789
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,220
what we then do is you know when we're

790
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,500
writing our research up in different

791
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,899
reports or in presentations we could

792
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:26,640
tailor it right the common operating

793
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,260
picture the common frame of reference

794
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,600
ends up being a really good framework to

795
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,799
use

796
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,760
if I'm talking to a risk professional I

797
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,620
will use terms they know

798
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,220
I'm talking to a senior executive put it

799
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,500
in context of impact

800
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,140
what is the risk to the organization how

801
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,539
much could this cost things that they

802
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,640
will naturally gravitate towards and

803
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,299
hone in on

804
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,720
the ability to adapt communication style

805
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,260
is particularly important for various

806
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,720
analysts and you'll find that the more

807
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,299
seasoned they get the longer they've

808
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,000
kind of lived in this field the more

809
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,240
experience they have in adapting

810
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,679
and adapting to various different

811
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,380
audiences it's you know

812
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,779
back in the day analysts tended to just

813
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:21,419
write reports let me let me do research

814
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,220
and let me write

815
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,960
um that has kind of changed and even

816
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,760
when I was at the agency we noticed that

817
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,279
there was kind of a shift in personality

818
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,220
types for people who were

819
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,140
driven to this profession

820
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,640
so

821
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,340
teamwork and emotional intelligence is I

822
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,960
think kind of critically important to

823
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,600
understanding How to Be an Effective

824
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,200
worker how to be effective in the larger

825
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,419
construct understanding the interplay

826
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,820
between vulnerability management

827
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,140
um

828
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,840
the incident Response Team

829
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,240
um asks what we do

830
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,820
risk critically important

831
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,440
critically important and that kind of

832
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,120
falls under those business Acumen

833
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,159
category and likewise emotional

834
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,260
intelligence really speaks to

835
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,659
your ability to be self-aware

836
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,399
socially aware

837
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,120
and maintain self-control

838
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,679
not everybody

839
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,200
will be perfect on every single one of

840
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,299
these competencies and that's kind of a

841
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,860
big takeaway too

842
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,200
we were thinking about evaluating the

843
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,659
organization's needs

844
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,820
were thinking about bringing people in

845
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,860
at various different levels whether it's

846
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,260
more junior level or more senior level

847
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,360
we'll want to identify

848
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,720
where they should be on the Spectrum

849
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,480
and we all have strengths and weaknesses

850
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,640
so some people are going to be stronger

851
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,320
than others across these various

852
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,678
different competencies

853
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,760
and this is just kind of a quick summary

854
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,659
understanding how we share information

855
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,419
whether we need to put into a more

856
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,460
Tactical

857
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,740
format that our security controls can

858
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,419
understand or whether our humans are

859
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,519
going to be reading it like yourselves

860
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,799
understanding how to engage when to

861
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,918
engage how to navigate conflict how to

862
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,500
resolve conflict

863
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,020
and then really aligning everything to

864
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,239
the overall organization's missions and

865
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,020
goals is kind of critical there so one

866
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,060
of the things that I point out

867
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,560
particularly in this last bullet point

868
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,639
is

869
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,199
understanding

870
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,239
specific systems that are used by the

871
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,719
organization

872
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,500
so if you're operating so to be

873
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,699
effective

874
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,739
as a cyber threat intelligence analyst

875
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,000
there's a few things that I think you

876
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,379
need

877
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,899
one of which is to understand like core

878
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,760
dependencies throughout modeling being

879
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,699
able to understand systems so in this

880
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,280
particular case if I'm an analyst

881
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,980
working in the financial sector

882
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,900
it's not sufficient for me just to

883
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,599
understand it architecture and security

884
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,240
I need to also understand the fintech

885
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,520
side of things too which is very unique

886
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,820
which is a very Niche Focus same thing

887
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,099
with telecommunications I need to

888
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,780
understand the cellular technology

889
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,780
behind it what goes into ss7 how those

890
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,420
systems actually work in process

891
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,079
um

892
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,460
and as we are growing the field

893
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,420
we not just only have folks coming from

894
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,160
information security backgrounds we

895
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,640
actually have folks coming from uh kind

896
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,800
of the more social sciency backgrounds

897
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,920
too so putting this together and uh

898
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,140
laying it out in a way where they can

899
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,020
understand what they need to uh focus on

900
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,759
helps create growth pathways

901
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,079
all right what probably resonates the

902
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,940
most with you guys is technical literacy

903
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,760
and boy is there a lot in here

904
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,460
there's Enterprise I.T networks there's

905
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,440
cyber security ecosystem and then roles

906
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,180
and responsibilities

907
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,579
holy cow this field has grown a lot in

908
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,359
the last 15 years in the last 10 years

909
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,339
really

910
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,700
um and likewise we need to consider the

911
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,000
implications of that so for our analysts

912
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,859
who kind of

913
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,839
grew up in the field

914
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,020
we were fortunate in that our knowledge

915
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,680
growth was incremental

916
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,839
for newer analysts who are just joining

917
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,839
now there's a lot to take in

918
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:33,180
there is a lot to take in

919
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,619
so

920
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,720
understanding the way systems are

921
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,160
architected understanding the way

922
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,920
networks are architected some of the

923
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,160
design decisions behind it

924
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,280
that would and what it means to move to

925
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,040
a you know full or partial hybrid

926
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,800
solution where your on-prem off-prem or

927
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,020
uh not all things that need to be

928
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,339
considered because when we're looking at

929
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,200
this from the context of the adversary

930
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,500
the attack surface varies and different

931
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,119
adversary groups

932
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,099
will focus on

933
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:06,660
different techniques based on the

934
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,400
environment that they're in

935
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,300
and likewise understanding what actually

936
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,980
exists as part of cyber security now

937
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,660
again if you're looking at those two

938
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,040
tracks

939
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,500
traditional intelligence analysts or

940
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,180
cyber security professionals who kind of

941
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,560
come into this

942
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,140
the latter they kind of know this we

943
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,820
grew up with this we understand the

944
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,099
cyber security framework we understand

945
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,500
what it actually breaks down to but

946
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,940
there's still barriers of entry for

947
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,099
those coming in on the other side those

948
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,240
who are really good at the critical

949
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
thinking who are really good at

950
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,380
communicating and presenting but

951
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,440
have not perhaps focused on Cyber you

952
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,640
know they're trying to Grapple with it

953
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,140
and get their head around it so that

954
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,780
they can be proficient and effective

955
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,820
so

956
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,760
um and likewise right as we've seen the

957
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,220
growth of this field we've seen various

958
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,260
different roles and terminology come up

959
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,920
we've seen

960
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,420
various different concepts kind of a

961
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,440
rise

962
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,300
just understanding where everything

963
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,760
interplays inside of that helps

964
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
understand our ability to communicate

965
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,700
effectively with you to work with you

966
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,040
um and the converse can be set too

967
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,740
one area I did want to touch on though

968
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,320
uh before we move on to the Cyber threat

969
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,900
proficiencies is this

970
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
the notion of

971
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,359
slas and racing matrices

972
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:39,060
it wasn't until a few years ago that I

973
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,400
was actually introduced to them and holy

974
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,020
cow those are critically important to

975
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,579
know

976
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,760
foreign

977
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,960
so as we're thinking through how we can

978
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,420
best support

979
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,859
a lot of it comes down to understanding

980
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,740
okay what what does the port look like

981
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,540
really kind of unpacking and dissecting

982
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,800
it

983
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,780
racing matrices especially on the

984
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,000
analytics side are huge so who is going

985
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,320
to be the action arm who is going to be

986
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,359
responsible who's going to be informed

987
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,040
with a client that I'm working with

988
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,780
right now I actually created a modified

989
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,700
racing Matrix for their team

990
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,859
so that they can work better across

991
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:25,099
incident response portability management

992
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,260
Enterprise protection and risk

993
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,480
I created a modified racing Matrix for

994
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,160
them so that they can understand their

995
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,740
stakeholder needs how they best consume

996
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,079
information based on what they're

997
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,000
producing and how they're producing it

998
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,520
what the right conduit is and what the

999
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,640
right workflow kicks off but will kick

1000
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,200
off the right workflow

1001
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,720
in when they need it so this gets back

1002
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,960
to from the Intel side just us

1003
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,579
understanding those intelligence

1004
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:55,380
requirements

1005
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,339
um you know

1006
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:00,320
what the prioritization level is

1007
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,839
and this is our bread and butter cyber

1008
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,660
threat proficiencies

1009
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,839
drivers of offensive operations threat

1010
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,060
Concepts and Frameworks and threat

1011
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,160
actors and ttps

1012
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,260
you'll find that inside of this

1013
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,359
framework that we've put out I think

1014
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:20,400
Nine Pages a good like two and a half or

1015
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,220
three pages is just dedicated to this

1016
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,040
this whole area uh this breakdown

1017
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,740
others and it ranges the gamut

1018
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,560
understanding actors understanding actor

1019
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,480
groups understanding nation state

1020
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,339
programs or criminal programs the

1021
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:38,460
composition of them or concepts like

1022
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,220
attribution when does it matter why does

1023
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,940
it matter does it even matter what does

1024
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:47,040
it mean that they might have a

1025
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,619
multi-stage

1026
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,640
piece of malware that they're using

1027
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,020
module malware or various different

1028
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,700
exploit chains all kind of pulled

1029
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,440
together

1030
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,260
being able to understand this is I think

1031
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,780
the bread and butter of the profession

1032
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,700
itself of bread and butter of what we

1033
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,800
have to offer because we take a little

1034
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,180
bit of what you all are doing and we try

1035
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,680
and

1036
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,800
then apply it we take the information

1037
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,099
about the adversaries and how they

1038
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,280
go about conducting their operations uh

1039
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,359
dumping credentials has the hashtags etc

1040
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,079
etc

1041
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,420
and then we can contextualize it oh

1042
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,579
here's our top threat actors that we

1043
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,500
tend to see in the environment

1044
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,720
here's the top threat actors that you

1045
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,980
know based on the landscape with the

1046
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,359
industry profile

1047
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,599
we are likely to encounter here's the

1048
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,000
commonality now we can test our security

1049
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,220
controls against it all of that is

1050
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,260
predicated on prioritization and

1051
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,420
understanding under knowing that there

1052
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,760
are finite resources available inside of

1053
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,599
the organization itself

1054
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,220
so I've broken it out again into kind of

1055
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,099
this summary chart here

1056
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:03,660
and

1057
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,579
I'll walk through just a few of those

1058
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:07,920
examples in a second I'll just pause and

1059
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,260
let you kind of digest what that summary

1060
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,800
looks like

1061
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,220
of the areas that I'll hit on before we

1062
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,980
move on to the next uh slide is this

1063
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,599
concept of understanding what

1064
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,440
framework's exist

1065
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,839
really it's not so much what Frameworks

1066
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,839
exist it's what Frameworks exist why

1067
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,060
they exist what problem did they help us

1068
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,859
overcome if we're still using them today

1069
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,540
there has to be a good reason why we're

1070
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,920
still using it

1071
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,859
and how can I apply it what are the

1072
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:55,099
tools in my toolkit that I can then use

1073
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:57,660
and how can I use them

1074
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,940
miter attack is the most ubiquitous of

1075
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,800
those Frameworks that exists

1076
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,980
it is you know integrated into security

1077
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,460
detection products it is also a

1078
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,619
quick and easy way for us to have a

1079
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,060
standard lexicon

1080
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,619
but there are others right there are

1081
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,940
things like the diamond model of

1082
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,700
attribution of intrusion analysis

1083
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,339
um

1084
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:22,140
there are the Lockheed Martin cyber kill

1085
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,960
chain there are several other Frameworks

1086
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,180
that we use that all serve various

1087
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,380
purposes

1088
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,020
to help us understand

1089
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,020
and characterize and Define

1090
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,579
the threat groups that we care about

1091
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,420
so at a high level right our analysts

1092
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,240
should be able to tell you for instance

1093
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,940
what's the motivation right cyber is

1094
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,099
used cyber operations are used as an

1095
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,359
asymmetric tool when we're thinking

1096
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,319
about this from a nation-state

1097
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,460
perspective

1098
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,160
the ability to conduct operations over

1099
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,220
the Internet offers some anonymity there

1100
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,900
are more things we can do to improve

1101
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,460
operational security but when we're

1102
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,900
thinking about this from a motivation

1103
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,460
perspective

1104
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,740
there's really just a handful of those

1105
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,079
motivators that exist

1106
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,700
we're looking at it from an Espionage

1107
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,380
perspective the analyst should be able

1108
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,540
to tell you well there's economic

1109
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,220
benefit political benefit military

1110
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,960
benefit

1111
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,839
there are reasons why groups might do

1112
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,359
things like destructive attacks or

1113
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,220
employ destructive parts or even some

1114
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,839
anti-forensic techniques as part of

1115
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,460
their operations

1116
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,800
they should be able to enumerate down to

1117
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,099
that level

1118
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,520
should be able to define the various

1119
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,740
roles and responsibilities in an

1120
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,599
offensive cyber program

1121
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,060
the vitamin nation-state actor

1122
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,680
chances are

1123
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,619
I am working as a team in order to

1124
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:51,119
develop capabilities and conduct

1125
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,660
operations

1126
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,160
this is probably something that most of

1127
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,079
us on the practitioner side in cyber

1128
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,280
security haven't really thought about

1129
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,800
it's just oh well there's intrusion

1130
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,540
activity we need to do something about

1131
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,319
it

1132
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,520
okay well let's unpack that a little bit

1133
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,099
an intrusion activity is a tool or it's

1134
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,140
a technique being used

1135
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,880
how many techniques does a group have

1136
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,319
what does their composition look like

1137
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,819
when we're thinking about this again

1138
00:45:17,819 --> 00:45:19,980
because I'm harping back a little to my

1139
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:23,119
experience in the government

1140
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,319
what's the overall capability or

1141
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,720
resilience of a cyber operations program

1142
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,079
if they keep getting detected or if we

1143
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:33,480
you know find ways to impose pain upon

1144
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,319
them

1145
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,240
well that's predicated on the

1146
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,099
composition it's predicated on the

1147
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,540
availability of things like um

1148
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,800
and it really

1149
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,720
ends up being an interesting discussion

1150
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,859
about

1151
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:49,260
okay

1152
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,020
does that matter and who are we

1153
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,839
attributing it to or when and how all

1154
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:58,520
things of that fall into the silk

1155
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,280
I haven't found a great diagram that

1156
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,180
exists to kind of describe the lay of

1157
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,700
the land for a cyber operation so I made

1158
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,939
one

1159
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,040
um when we're

1160
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,920
thinking about

1161
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,079
adversary operations

1162
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:22,020
naturally there's this concept of the

1163
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,540
hacker or the bad guy the attacker well

1164
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,460
they're doing things they're using gray

1165
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,540
space they're using middleware

1166
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,940
infrastructure and they ultimately land

1167
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,099
on their targets what does it actually

1168
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:33,900
look like and what can they do to make

1169
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,760
things harder or more difficult to

1170
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,960
detect

1171
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,300
this ends up being something that

1172
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,099
you'll find that the analysts will do

1173
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,040
right we will take things right

1174
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,380
complex Concepts

1175
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,760
detections we're seeing in the

1176
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,560
organization and we will find effective

1177
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,260
ways to present it

1178
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,520
so I created this

1179
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:59,520
to show one of my clients okay as we're

1180
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,640
thinking about adversary operations

1181
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,619
this is really what it boils down to

1182
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:06,900
this is a framework onto itself this is

1183
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,880
a mental model that leads itself to

1184
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,760
discussion I can identify all of the

1185
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,020
different hosting providers I can

1186
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,200
identify all of the different operations

1187
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,240
security measures that they do the

1188
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
cutouts the Rings

1189
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,640
um what servers are being used for

1190
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,319
x-fill versus what servers are being

1191
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,599
used for remote command and control

1192
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,339
I could show that

1193
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:30,900
and

1194
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,480
when we're trying to take our data and

1195
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,480
present it to senior executives

1196
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,700
having somebody who can

1197
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,160
take something and make kind of a

1198
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,859
brilliant picture like this tends to be

1199
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,900
incredibly effective

1200
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:49,500
because it's a conversation starter so

1201
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,660
I use this with a client and I think we

1202
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,060
spent 30 minutes talking through all the

1203
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,400
intricacies of adversary operations

1204
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,680
with their incident Response Team asking

1205
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,200
about how many points of presence do you

1206
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,720
usually see an adversary have for

1207
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,400
footholds on the network or Beach heads

1208
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,420
on the network

1209
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,000
versus you know how many systems are

1210
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,859
usually used for staging

1211
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,540
right it ends up being kind of a good

1212
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,160
conversation starter there but these

1213
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,960
again are all things that your analysts

1214
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,300
should be able to do

1215
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,160
I've just given you kind of enumeration

1216
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,440
here a list of the various Frameworks

1217
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,480
nothing uh that I've seen like this

1218
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,819
exists yet

1219
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,380
and I'll I'll use this as a chance to

1220
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,760
kind of wrap up realizing we're coming

1221
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,780
up at the time limit pretty quickly

1222
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,619
unicorns exist but they're rare

1223
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,000
you will have analysts who are

1224
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,260
technically steeped you will have

1225
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,579
analysts who are very good at the

1226
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:43,440
Strategic side of things you have some

1227
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,599
who uh have a preference in tracking

1228
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,420
adversary operations across and working

1229
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,079
with various teams and stakeholders

1230
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,920
understanding where strengths and

1231
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,460
weaknesses are is critical uh not

1232
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,200
ascribing

1233
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,560
particular generalization to a team or

1234
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,300
individuals is also kind of important

1235
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,079
too

1236
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,380
I realized that our day-to-day

1237
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,960
operations that we have

1238
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,540
tend to be in such a pace such a Tempo

1239
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,760
where it's really hard to sometimes be

1240
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,740
able to take a take a step back and say

1241
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,500
okay just because this analysts uh you

1242
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,000
know might not be super strong here

1243
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,920
doesn't mean that their colleague is

1244
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,780
uh or they're they're not good at this

1245
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,640
they can't support me so let me not use

1246
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,740
them or let me not try and use them

1247
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,380
I'd ask that you give us a chance you'll

1248
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,420
find that there's variance and we're

1249
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,920
thinking about team composition even in

1250
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,180
your own teams

1251
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,920
there are strengths and weaknesses that

1252
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,180
exist

1253
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,020
by Design

1254
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,480
team composition tends to be a composite

1255
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,119
we are strong collectively together and

1256
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,880
ideally your analysts should be humble

1257
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,099
enough to acknowledge where they're not

1258
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,660
strong and point in the direction to

1259
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,060
somebody who is

1260
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,040
unfortunately there's no standard role

1261
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,720
right when we think about things like

1262
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,300
strategic threat analysts we can kind of

1263
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,240
Intuit what that means versus technical

1264
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,380
analysts

1265
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:11,280
versus an intelligence engineer or a

1266
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,319
somebody who's kind of doing behind the

1267
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:15,420
scenes data scam will work for us and

1268
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,920
creating tools that are going to help

1269
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,140
support our mission

1270
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,079
know that there are unspoken rules on

1271
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,420
both sides on smoking expectations there

1272
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,119
so likewise I'm going to be making

1273
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,819
assumptions about what I think you do if

1274
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,200
you've not necessarily told me

1275
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,240
specifically

1276
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,780
that's usually a recipe for disaster

1277
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,920
um

1278
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,980
CTI teams should always be seeking out

1279
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,140
feedback those feedback loops help us

1280
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,420
improve our ability to support likewise

1281
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,099
be proactive about it

1282
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:49,400
if you take the time and you actually

1283
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,859
meet regularly or occasionally with the

1284
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,720
CTI teams and walk them through your

1285
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,240
workflow walk them through what a day in

1286
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,760
your life looks like they will be way

1287
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,819
more effective at helping you

1288
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:03,599
um

1289
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,640
I've been fortunate in my career to have

1290
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,200
worked incident response to it for

1291
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,940
digital forensics to avoid strategic

1292
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,640
cyber program stuffed or policy stuff so

1293
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,980
I could Flex across all those topics I

1294
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,720
can use the common language I understand

1295
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,380
the type of decisions and use cases

1296
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,940
they're dealing with with regularity

1297
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,980
that's not everybody

1298
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,079
actually that's not most

1299
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:28,020
so give them benefit of the doubt the

1300
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,960
more you can the more you can provide

1301
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,540
about your particular role the

1302
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,460
responsibilities and how you conduct

1303
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,619
your operations they could start

1304
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:39,839
tailoring towards it pretty quickly

1305
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,720
one of the things that you'll find is in

1306
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,300
this field there's no shortage of smart

1307
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,140
people

1308
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,000
and they want to help obviously we're a

1309
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,200
service organization

1310
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,260
we want to help you accomplish the

1311
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,500
collective goals better faster

1312
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,480
Etc so

1313
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,160
being able to provide that feedback

1314
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,900
being able to provide that series of

1315
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,220
um

1316
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,200
engagement and mentorship and guidance

1317
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,380
is critical on both sides so that we can

1318
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,359
have a common understanding

1319
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,760
and as we think about

1320
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,480
um

1321
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,540
this is just a personal one here as you

1322
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:21,079
think about engaging the CTI teams

1323
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,359
understand that they have a lot of

1324
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:26,460
priorities much like you do so be

1325
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,760
realistic about what your slas look like

1326
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,920
not everything could be a priority

1327
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,020
but when you do say something's a

1328
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,720
priority it needs to be a priority so

1329
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,640
just think about that

1330
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,119
and uh that's all I've got here so the

1331
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,640
last thing I'll close out with is

1332
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,460
please don't be a Regina George we can

1333
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,319
absolutely make fetch happen we can make

1334
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,240
it happen together collectively as a

1335
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,280
team

1336
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,140
I've got my Twitter handle here I've

1337
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,300
given you a link to the blog post that

1338
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,920
then links off to the actual framework

1339
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,599
itself

1340
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,160
um if we have time and we figured out

1341
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,859
the kind of q a setup I'm happy to take

1342
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:07,380
any questions otherwise we can push that

1343
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,160
