about flying gliders and glider

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,319
aerobatics so the small thing I can

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,099
afford to brag about is that I was a

57
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,319
member of the few years ago member of

58
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,060

60
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,500
championship

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
so yeah quite a proud of this

62
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,800
achievement

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,620
a little disclaimer let's say everything

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,840
I'm going to talk about is fiction just

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,599
for the for the sake of it

66
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,739
um I will talk about a few incidents or

67
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,580
or big events that happened but I'll be

68
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,879
most of the time generally speaking so

69
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,760
not only about what happens in my job

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,400
but what I feel happens in everyone's

71
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,700
job in this area and obviously all the

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,299
views expressed are are my own

73
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,200
okay so let's start with the topic

74
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,720
um I would like to to talk to you about

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,959
what it means to be a cyber Defender uh

76
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,019
what's the job what's the daily job

77
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:57,480
first of all uh if I can take a quick

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,659
survey who here in the audience is

79
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,500
working on Blue Team search cert and

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,700
that kind of

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,200
okay I'm not on my own great thanks

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,120
um so yeah I'd like to also try to to

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,019
debunk part of the myth around the Cyber

84
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,940
defense

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,580
um The Daily job is not always about

86
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,300
finding apts in our Network everywhere

87
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,580
and nature nation-state sponsored

88
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,139
attacks and so on

89
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,500
the daily job is mostly business as

90
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,440
usual it's mostly

91
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,759
phishing emails so many of them and in

92
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,860
small orgs big orgs yeah we we get so

93
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,720
many of them everyone knows it's a major

94
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,320
risk of intrusion so um so yeah it takes

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,080
a big part of our time fishing emails

96
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,860
again I'm gonna talk uh to mention them

97
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,960
quite a lot

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,000
CEO fraud attempts using corporate means

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
non-corporate means

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,340
again in a wide company that's uh that's

101
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,460
happening quite often malware detections

102
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,300
viruses puas we have

103
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
and again in every company in every

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,000
culture we see different

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,120
um different ways different kinds of

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,759
malware and viruses around the world we

107
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,039
have some countries are I would say good

108
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,800
customers in terms of incident uh

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,100
incident detection but it's it's

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,320
Universal it's worldwide it's everywhere

111
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,340
and it takes so much of our time we we

112
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,560
spend with phishing emails so much time

113
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,380
doing this new vulnerabilities we need

114
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,919
to study to assess to create a detection

115
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,919
rule to be able to stop it and block it

116
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,479
and so on expose credentials again in a

117
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,300
big org you have users using their

118
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,080
Corporate email to subscribe on another

119
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,660
website and so on and these get pawned

120
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,000
and exposed and and you need to

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,120
to work out the consequences uh oh

122
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,880
phishing emails was uh it's been a long

123
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,360
time a new malware and so on and so on

124
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,580
suspicious traffic uh uh to to a C2 and

125
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,220
you need to go and fetch the hostname

126
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,259
launch an investigation see what happens

127
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,900
and so on and with them

128
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,020
the the um the size of the company

129
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,259
really makes the numbers of these uh

130
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,440
enormous it's it's huge

131
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,340
we also have uh bigger things small

132
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,560
incidents can transform can get into

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,800
bigger incidents you can see them coming

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,419
so very quickly I'll talk about big

135
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:57,120
events that everyone went through uh in

136
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,180
the last few years no surprise wannacry

137
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,139
was uh really something huge and for a

138
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,460
big company to assess the the exposure

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,400
to make sure that you don't have one

140
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,180
unpatched system in uh at the other end

141
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,060
of the world uh in a whatever data

142
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,740
center

143
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,840
it's really a challenge and I remember

144
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
you know teams running around to to

145
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,960
patch everything to make sure nothing

146
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,460
came in that could uh that could break

147
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,259
us

148
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,380
was really really demanding I know and I

149
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,360
know every company went through this

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,759
same with not picture I remember not

151
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,220
picture even more vividly because every

152
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,240
morning we would wake up where we hit oh

153
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
no we weren't okay good but every day

154
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,060
there was a new company down because of

155
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,240
this and and they were losing millions

156
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,660
billions every day and so on and I

157
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,300
really feel there was a before 2017 and

158
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,960
after 2017 it really changed the way

159
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,660
cyber security was seen cyber security

160
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,060
started

161
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,039
making Front Page News which almost

162
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,680
didn't happen before that

163
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,160
it also helps get more Awareness on the

164
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,259
topic

165
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,660
seeing yeah Neighbors being really badly

166
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,919
hit with this

167
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,180
more recently we had look for Shell less

168
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,299
than a year ago

169
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,159
it's not the same kind of event and not

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,520
the same kind of Crisis but that's the

171
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,500
kind of I would say proactive crisis

172
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,719
that you can see coming

173
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,020
obviously on a Friday afternoon you can

174
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,120
see Twitter and the networks and

175
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,220
everything starting to buzz and tremble

176
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,040
with bits and pieces of information and

177
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,740
you know your weekend is ruined you're

178
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,959
not gonna have a weekend you can cancel

179
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,540
all your plans because you'll you'll be

180
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,620
there doing your job trying to assess to

181
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,160
patch to detect and and so on and so on

182
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,700
so that that's also part of the daily

183
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,040
job luckily it doesn't happen

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
every day but uh often enough for us to

185
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,300
to remember it and to be impacted by um

186
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
by this

187
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,399
uh internal incidents as well uh which

188
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,720
uh put everyone in a in a panic

189
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,320
quite a long time ago we've had one I

190
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,420
can talk about every incident we we had

191
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,700
but we had one quite a long time ago

192
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,300
with one compromise account

193
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,880
um this compromised account was used to

194
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
send internal phishing email to several

195
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,680
hundred users a few of them got

196
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,779
compromised and then churn and were used

197
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,680
to send another uh campaign of uh of

198
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,920
internal phishing emails to another a

199
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,260
few hundred users and so on and so on

200
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,220
and it doesn't sound big but the team

201
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,260
was very small at that time

202
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,140
it's I mean we almost didn't sleep for

203
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,480
two weeks we felt we were two trains uh

204
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,160
while the attackers were two trains

205
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,339
ahead all the time it was exhausting we

206
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,800
really felt we would never catch them

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,200
never reach out to them in the end we

208
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,100
did uh with a huge backlog and a huge

209
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,000
mess to to clean uh and yeah again very

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,839
little sleep yeah that's uh that's the

211
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,260
job it also in all these crisis that's

212
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,120
where you create awareness that well

213
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,940
that's where you get all the users and

214
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,360
the rest of the it teams helping you

215
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,820
um and you know doing everyone's doing

216
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,779
their part it's also quite nice to see

217
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,500
this and and that's where you you move

218
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,959
forward you will improve your maturity

219
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,320
your posture thanks to this uh difficult

220
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,019
moment I would I would say

221
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,240
part of the job is also from time to

222
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,519
time having a beer with colleagues at

223
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,519
the end of the day after a crisis after

224
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,040
a great regular day so uh so yeah I

225
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
thought that would fit into the Rook on

226
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,279
landscape

227
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,399
another part of the job I that I don't

228
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
think we mentioned often enough is about

229
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,579
Communications

230
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,140
communicating

231
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,120
about an incident internal incidents

232
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,000
external one we regularly use

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,519
public external incidents to create

234
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,519
awareness to communicate so the famous

235
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,279
hack that happened a couple of weeks ago

236
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,000
with the MFA fatigue intrusion we use

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,339
this to communicate to users you know

238
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:59,459
like don't do this and even if you

239
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,640
receive like dozens and dozens of MFA or

240
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,180
push requests don't so yeah every

241
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,720
opportunity is good to communicate

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
communication is also

243
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,399
with all the stakeholders about

244
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,260
explaining why something happened

245
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,140
because for other it teams or

246
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,779
non-technical people

247
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,820
when they see okay a user has clicked on

248
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,160
a phishing email but why did they click

249
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,899
they had completed their awareness

250
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,480
program and training shouldn't have

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,740
clicked

252
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,360
well their user their job is about you

253
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,980
know they were expecting that kind of

254
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,220
email okay they clicked and we are there

255
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,700
to to to make sure that there is as

256
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,740
little impact as possible

257
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,160
same with MFA How could an account get

258
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
compromised when we have MFA deployed

259
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,579
everywhere

260
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,440
well latest news MFA can be bypassed and

261
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,260
then you know tokens stolen and so on

262
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,200
and so on and

263
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,660
um it's sometimes difficult to explain

264
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,680
that risk zero doesn't exist even with

265
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,019
the newest tools and MFA and so on

266
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,000
incidents will keep happening intrusions

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,120
will keep happening and um and yeah even

268
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,700
if we're very good our at our job and

269
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,660
have millions in all the newest tool

270
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,300
that's uh that's why we're we're here

271
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,220
another part of comms is about working

272
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,279
with sales representatives so externally

273
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,920
I don't know if some of you have regular

274
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,180
interaction with uh with sales people

275
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,959
um

276
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,339
I think we we need to to improve on both

277
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,839
parts on that topic but it can can be a

278
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,899
difficult part of communications as well

279
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:01,860
um

280
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,620
with you know LinkedIn connection

281
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,560
requests you know like we both work in

282
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,500
cyber security let's connect

283
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,240
no let's not and I really I mean I and

284
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,420
and all my network receives dozens of

285
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,279
these that's yeah that's a bit annoying

286
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,480
um emails from sales representatives I I

287
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,279
once was colded by someone because I

288
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,760
hadn't answered to any of his six emails

289
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,620
that he had sent to me in the past two

290
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,800
weeks demanding a meeting with me

291
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,339
and again if I were to answer every

292
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,680
email I get from sales people I would

293
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,800
spend two hours a day on this that's not

294
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
my job I cannot do this

295
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,139
but it you know it takes some

296
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,320
availability and you received it you

297
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,199
discarded and so on and so on

298
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,180
um it's part of the job but maybe you

299
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,100
know some good practice could be could

300
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,380
be uh could be set up I know it's not an

301
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,220
easy job definitely and we need sales

302
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,260
people to discover new tools and

303
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,959
Technologies Innovations and features

304
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,779
but uh but yeah that is maybe a bit of

305
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,480
work a bit of a balance to be found

306
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,680
in the same area not always sales people

307
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,720
but but quite often it's in that area

308
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,560
the marketing buzzwords uh and and

309
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,940
um you know clingy sentences to to to

310
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,760
make believe that the tool is is like

311
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,639
you know kind of magic

312
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,300
um I once had someone telling me that

313
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,680
their tool was proactively detecting any

314
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,500
attack before the intrusion phase and

315
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,100
even before the reconnaissance phase

316
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,860
okay okay

317
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,899
demo maybe no

318
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,639
um or that uh another one was telling

319
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,940
that they really strongly believe in AI

320
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,639
AI is the future because you know

321
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,220
incident response teams

322
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,320
um when they have an incident ticketing

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,339
tool they get a detection about an IP

324
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,760
address with some weird traffic and with

325
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,639
AI you can match that IP address with a

326
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,380
host name

327
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,260
no come on guys that's called enrichment

328
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,680
that's not AI so you get to know AI

329
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,620
everywhere and blockchain deep learning

330
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,740
machine learning and so on and and so

331
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,459
maybe you know if some sales people uh

332
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,779
are watching this maybe work a bit on

333
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,000
the I'm not asking to be experts but

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
maybe work a bit on the technical side

335
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,160
of things to do a bit of fact checking

336
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,500
and to make sure that we can we can

337
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,959
discuss

338
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,040
um but also good salespeople I want to

339
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,859
acknowledge this uh when you know they

340
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,439
managed to arouse my curiosity with a

341
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,780
new feature something that would really

342
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,299
help the team on a daily basis and like

343
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,880
okay let's set up a demo I wanna I wanna

344
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,600
have a look at this

345
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,280
um I was talking about the sales people

346
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,839
expertise

347
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,660
what about hours

348
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,200
um

349
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,620
a few years ago

350
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,020
10 15 years ago we could call ourselves

351
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,820
cyber Security Experts

352
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,039
I honestly don't think we can do that

353
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,740
anymore

354
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,500
we are incident detection and response

355
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,380
experts Incident Management experts

356
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,440
but then in our daily job we're being

357
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,820
asked to evaluate a vulnerability how is

358
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,000
that vulnerability exploited which are

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,580
the attack techniques and methods and

360
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,760
ttps around this

361
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,320
so we need to train on the offensive

362
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,760
tools as well to be able to test and and

363
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,360
do it in a lab or something

364
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
we are being requested a few risks

365
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,700
analyzes about a specific again incident

366
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,940
exploit vulnerability and so on we're

367
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,340
being asked about

368
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,179
OT expertise that's really interesting I

369
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,740
mean obviously in a Manufacturing

370
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,340
Company there's a lot of it it's really

371
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,559
interesting but it's it's a whole

372
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,179
another world and a whole another

373
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,360
expertise in terms of cyber security in

374
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,120
terms of the ways of working and the

375
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,799
constraints requirements and so on

376
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,700
so

377
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,280
what I want to say here is that we need

378
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,860
to keep an open mind for awareness for

379
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,200
creativity to be able to do our job

380
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,340
better but some people expect us to be

381
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,580
experts in everything

382
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,840
that's not something we we can do and

383
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,620
personally I now I I manage a bigger

384
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
team than I used to so there's Team

385
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,679
Management individual management budget

386
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,919
paperwork

387
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,980
and all this added with the requirement

388
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,340
and and the need personally to keep a

389
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,760
technical expertise in my field

390
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,020
that's becoming more and more difficult

391
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,080
for me and and I guess for lots of uh

392
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,440
lots of people

393
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,720
for example I'll I'm being totally

394
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,160
transparent here you talk to me about

395
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,940
malware engineering reversing and so on

396
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,220
uh no I'm not there that's something I

397
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,059
know nothing about I understand nothing

398
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,960
about you show me uh a bunch of either

399
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,660
lines assembly lines I get a headache

400
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,100
and and that's it

401
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,700
um same for legal topics security

402
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
policies governance gdpr

403
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,820
I know what I need to do my job but but

404
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,679
that's it maybe someday it's going to

405
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,260
change and I'm gonna discover more of it

406
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,620
and say wow security policies I love it

407
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,479
but not not today

408
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,780
so here we are with our bits and pieces

409
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,240
of expertise all together and we're

410
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,280
trying to

411
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,179
um

412
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,660
uh defend defend the job the production

413
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,320
the business and the purpose in fact is

414
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,600
to make sure there's no impact or as

415
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
little impact as possible

416
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,419
so I'll talk very quickly about the

417
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:00,000
kinds of impacts we may have and and

418
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,039
focus on the the bigger ones uh

419
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,020
afterwards

420
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,780
first of all technical impact that's

421
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,360
obvious you have an incident user

422
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,539
accounts gets blocked an application is

423
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,900
down or has been blocked by EDR or

424
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,940
whatever that's the small you know

425
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,880
day-to-day impacts that we get most of

426
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,620
all with a real incident a bigger one

427
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,700
impact can get financial when you have a

428
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
whole line of business down a factory

429
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,860
line a whole Factory a business

430
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,039
application and so on that's well

431
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,620
literally literally money down the drain

432
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,860
usually so that's where we need to work

433
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,860
to be fast to be efficient and and yeah

434
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,100
that's uh that's where we are useful

435
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,880
there's also a reputational damage I'll

436
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,340
fit it into the the financial part

437
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,159
because in the end the results are are

438
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,280
equivalent

439
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,440
legal impacts again I'm not going to

440
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
spend too too much time on this I'm

441
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,140
guessing that's not your favorite topic

442
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,200
but yeah PCI DSS gdpr

443
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,159
local regulations everywhere that I'm

444
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,580
not familiar with so um so yeah you need

445
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,760
to rely on other teams uh other teams as

446
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,659
well

447
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:25,260
and finally the human impact which well

448
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,480
Financial impact obviously is really

449
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,679
critical but human impact is so diverse

450
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,860
and comes in so many ways I think we're

451
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,760
just starting to see the beginning of it

452
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,280
obviously human impact when users cannot

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,980
work

454
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,260
because the the app is down factories

455
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,360
down and so on

456
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,780
um and even worse

457
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,880
users who people employees who lose

458
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,880
their job because a company has gone

459
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,020
bankrupt because of a ransomware

460
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,480
that's uh that's a really big one

461
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,980
on a psychological standpoint

462
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,260
cyber incidents

463
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,860
have an impact on users and we've had a

464
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,220
a case a few well a few few weeks ago

465
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,100
where users accounts have been has been

466
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,640
compromised and used in um in a fraud

467
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,840
scheme attempt well did not succeed

468
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,460
but the guy whose account was

469
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,179
compromised was so freaked out he was

470
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,059
terrified of logging in again because

471
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,480
his account and email had been used in

472
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,179
this fraud scheme so just logging in

473
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:44,880
again was he was scared that the

474
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,159
fraudsters would get back in because of

475
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,460
this and he was not trusting anything

476
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,900
anymore on his computer on his phone and

477
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,960
so on and that's just one case but I

478
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,059
guess we have so many more of the of

479
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,200
these

480
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
and the worst impact we

481
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,940
may have had I think it has already

482
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,400
happened this impact on on people's

483
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,640
lives in the sense of uh health and

484
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,380
safety

485
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,500
um with the ransomware attacks like

486
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,820
Wanna Cry which hit nhas and HS sorry in

487
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,780
the UK in uh in 2017 so many hospitals

488
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:32,400
were down were unable to take patients

489
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,059
um a month ago a major hospital south of

490
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,260
Paris was hit by logbitt I think and

491
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,799
yeah they had to diverge patients to

492
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,679
other hospitals they had to reschedule

493
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,220
operations and so on and you know what

494
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,200
if one day

495
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,980
um

496
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,620
someone doesn't get the the health

497
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,320
treatment he needs because of this I'm

498
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,720
quite sure it has happened what if

499
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,260
someone dies because of this there are

500
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,740
so many hospitals being hit so many

501
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,400
Health structure that's uh that's a

502
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,280
critical topic we need we need to

503
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,080
address

504
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,120
critical operations can be impacted as

505
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,179
well the Florida water treatment plants

506
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,440
in February 2021 I mean that the change

507
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,720
in the levels was discovered just in

508
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,140
time but consequences would have been

509
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,140
dramatic here and and that's just the

510
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,419
tip of the iceberg there are so many

511
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,720
more and I guess so many events we are

512
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,840
not not aware of

513
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,720
so to go back to

514
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,760
um to the initial topic

515
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,440
our job yeah defending defending

516
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,620
um business operations data personal

517
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,340
data defending people people's lives in

518
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,059
in some cases

519
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,460
and against well against swats just to

520
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,799
put a bit of a

521
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,539
a bit of food for thought here

522
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:16,559
one could say we are good against evil

523
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,779
because we're fighting fraudsters

524
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:23,340
attackers and so on that's also a very

525
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,100
personal question you know we we also

526
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,100
fight for example in every company orgs

527
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,100
hacktivism

528
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,320
that's really a question of perspective

529
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,380
some people can be aligned with the

530
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,200
causes defended by hacktivism maybe not

531
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,880
the means but yeah that's uh that's

532
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,659
another topic so I'll stick to we fight

533
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:49,500
cyber crime in its illegal aspect and

534
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,380
that's it the rest is for your for you

535
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,140
all to to to decide

536
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,020
and fighting this

537
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,220
um

538
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,159
what is our purpose what do we want to

539
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,500
do

540
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,140
we can see the way the way we defend the

541
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,779
purpose of our job is also to defend uh

542
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:11,240
people's lives

543
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,960
so that's that makes our job uh really

544
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,059
really important

545
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:21,240
and I mean we are the last line of

546
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,200
defense we are the Cavalry that comes

547
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
when all the protection layers have

548
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,360
failed before that the firewall has

549
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,700
failed the proxy the EDR whatever so

550
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,000
being this last line of defense our job

551
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,179
is so important and we need to do it 24

552
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,200
7 Around the Clock we need to be there

553
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,220
all the time to stay in the evening and

554
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,740
so on

555
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,360
I think we need to give ourselves a bit

556
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,179
of a credit here that's that's really

557
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,340
important

558
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,299
um and it all fits into a wording I had

559
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,179
not thought of before a few days ago

560
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:08,700
someone at work called me oh yeah yeah

561
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,200
you're the you're the lady in the

562
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,700
trenches I was like

563
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,279
I was like okay yeah why not and then

564
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,520
these trenches words made me think you

565
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,960
know I was talking about the last line

566
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,480
of defense uh talking about the Cavalry

567
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,760
and

568
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,520
um we defend all the time continuously

569
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,659
against continuous attacks that never

570
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,059
stop I mean phishing emails Network

571
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,940
scans against our public IPS and so on

572
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,159
that's continuous that's never that's

573
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
never stopping

574
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,179
so here

575
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,000
um it I really realized it recently we

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
are at War we are at War all the time

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,940
and until recently I thought because

578
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,179
that's a wording that has been used in

579
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,940
many Keynotes and conferences I was like

580
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,340
yeah you know and yesterday Dave with uh

581
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,760
with uh adapting adversaries and so on

582
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,220
but in my mind that was yeah but that's

583
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,740
for governments

584
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,400
um you know nation-state stuff

585
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,179
um

586
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,299
critical infrastructures and so on and

587
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:20,460
so on not yogurt you know but but yes it

588
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,700
is it is we are at war against cyber

589
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,120
crime all the time even for uh for the

590
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
business for for making yogurts and

591
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,360
water and or any activity that that your

592
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,380
company uh that your company has

593
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,700
um

594
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,470
so yeah it's uh

595
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,899
[Music]

596
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,960
it's a very demanding and very

597
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,760
exhausting uh way of thinking

598
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,940
and it's um

599
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,340
I mean the number of incidents is

600
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,380
exploding number of attacks is exploding

601
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,600
number of vulnerabilities is increasing

602
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,299
as well we are doing this all the time

603
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,760
with being you know being at war in our

604
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,760
minds which which is really a different

605
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,320
mindset

606
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,020
and

607
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,080
my my question is how are we supposed to

608
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,299
hold like this in the long run we're

609
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,340
doing this again and again on a

610
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,039
continuous basis

611
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,940
um we're expected to to stay later

612
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,860
because an incident has started and

613
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,840
you're not going to say no no sorry 6

614
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,520
p.m I need to

615
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,620
yeah I need to run away I have Pony

616
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,679
Lesson or whatever and um so yeah you

617
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,440
stay longer and you stay connected all

618
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,200
the time in your head you know what if

619
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,480
something has happened so you take your

620
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,980
phone in the evening and check it no

621
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,380
we're fine no no it's okay we're fine

622
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,600
and same the next morning and same on

623
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,860
the weekend and that's that's really

624
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,640
exhausting we're on all the time and I'm

625
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,520
not talking about people who are on duty

626
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,840
and who need to to to stay awake or or

627
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,000
alert at a at all times

628
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,159
so I know we

629
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,620
I mean that that that's also sorry

630
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,840
that's also a human impact that we need

631
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,700
to take into account the impact on

632
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,760
ourselves on our lives on the personal

633
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,440
and professional uh balance because

634
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,899
yeah if we keep up like this we won't be

635
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,620
doing this on the on the long run and

636
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,860
and I'm quite sure lots of you recognize

637
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,980
themselves in this picture because again

638
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,380
we're always on

639
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,539
um I'm hearing about more and more

640
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,140
people in the cyber security Community

641
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,320
see those that that are under so much

642
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,200
pressure

643
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,299
I've heard about a couple that changed

644
00:31:57,299 --> 00:31:59,820
job but they changed careers because

645
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,340
they could not take the pressure the

646
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,220
permanent pressure anymore

647
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,240
sock analysts going on burnout because

648
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,179
it's it's too much and they are doing so

649
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,020
much additional hours they get less and

650
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,419
less sleep and their personal life is

651
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,260
really being hit by this

652
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,480
and we need to keep up with the tooling

653
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
and the features and The Innovation and

654
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,059
and so on it's um

655
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:32,340
you know personally I don't know I mean

656
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,679
I love my job but I don't know if I can

657
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,679
work like this for

658
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,580
20 25 more years till

659
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,419
sorry till retirement uh I mean I'm

660
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,480
gonna be looking looking like this by

661
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,659
then

662
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,220
so

663
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,940
so yeah how do we keep doing it in a job

664
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,360
when you want to you want to to sustain

665
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,880
to to to thrive in a job first of all

666
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,320
you need a purpose

667
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,960
the purpose I think we have it we're

668
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,960
defending our organizations the data and

669
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,919
so on so that yeah that's easy and easy

670
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,740
to easy to find

671
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,440
um on the technical level we have the

672
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,679
purpose as well you know bringing in

673
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,679
more automation detecting better

674
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,659
detecting more uh yeah just improving uh

675
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,059
the the technical ways of uh of working

676
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,820
but the purpose is not sufficient here

677
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,860
because we we have that purpose already

678
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,679
and we see all these burnouts and and

679
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,559
people who can't take it anymore

680
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,159
we also need a reward a reward they are

681
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,580
obvious uh ways of having a reward

682
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,120
um well obviously uh

683
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,600
a bonus a raise a gift

684
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,539
we'll take it that's fine

685
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,200
um

686
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,340
a symbolic value like thank you or

687
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,120
um

688
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,260
a promotion visibility in the community

689
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,839
something like that will take it as well

690
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,879
that's good

691
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,379
um

692
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,980
on the technical side the reward of the

693
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,280
way we work is a more added value less

694
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,580
false positives more automation to focus

695
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,619
on the really difficult investigations

696
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:33,839
the the really bad incidents and so on

697
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,780
so this we we get as well

698
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,839
but there's another kind of reward that

699
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,159
we need and that will fuel us to do that

700
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,980
job on a continuous basis

701
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,040
the last kind of reward we we need is

702
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,020
success

703
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,300
when we when we work on a big incident

704
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,020
um or a small one whatever

705
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,540
we managed to detect something

706
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,200
potentially big by doing our job in the

707
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,480
proper way we managed to contain

708
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,520
something and

709
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,140
save operations from a big breakdown we

710
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,960
managed to I don't know quarantine a

711
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,320
massive phishing email campaign before

712
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,900
anyone clicked or provided their

713
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,000
credentials on the fishing websites we

714
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
I don't know we went French hunting and

715
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,960
and found a few ioc matching well that

716
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,940
might be bad news but it is bad news but

717
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,880
but we find them and put all the new

718
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,760
detection rules in place

719
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,800
clean everything yeah that's doing our

720
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,480
job well that is what I call success and

721
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,339
when we have success we want to do it

722
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:57,240
again we want to pursue that goal it's I

723
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,119
think it also has to do with

724
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,520
neuroscience and

725
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,420
dopamine rush you get when you when when

726
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,579
you have a reward when you have pleasure

727
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,020
and satisfaction in doing doing

728
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,260
something and that's what motivates the

729
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,260
brain to take the same right decision

730
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,020
again the next time and to feel

731
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,079
motivated and energized to do the same

732
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,980
thing so to do your job well so what I

733
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,220
want to say here is

734
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,400
success brings success it's a virtual

735
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,180
Circle I know we have we already love

736
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,280
the job we have the adrenaline rushes

737
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,680
when whenever we're in a big incidents

738
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,660
and we want to be there we want to do

739
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,599
our parts and investigate contain and so

740
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,660
on and and even if it's in the middle of

741
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,359
the night we'll always do it but on the

742
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,220
longer term

743
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,280
um it's it's really about being

744
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,760
energized being successful both on the

745
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
human side of it and the technical side

746
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,500
of it

747
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,619
implementing our tooling well and so on

748
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:10,200
and working well as a team I really

749
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,480
believe cyber security is a team sport

750
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,720
it's a team activity during an incident

751
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,359
everyone has their mission their job

752
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,400
their tasks and it all fits together

753
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,440
when it's running well

754
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,119
and um

755
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,359
it works for the community as well

756
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,380
I mean being here all of us gathered

757
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,900
that spot of the success that's part of

758
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,960
the reward that's what keeps us

759
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,260
energized to keep doing our job and

760
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,380
doing it well in order to keep fighting

761
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,480
cyber crime

762
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,440
so um well in a nutshell I'm gonna I'm

763
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,560
gonna end it in with this I don't know

764
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,500
what our job will look like tomorrow in

765
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,320
three years of five years from now the I

766
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,420
mean on the defensive side at least the

767
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,320
socks and certs I'm I'm thinking it

768
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
might change a lot because all the field

769
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,780
is evolving so fast

770
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,760
but

771
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,700
um whatever the changes and these

772
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,980
changes I guess will Define them all

773
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,800
together as a community whatever these

774
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,480
changes

775
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,980
um

776
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,820
yeah we need to to keep working together

777
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,339
uh towards success and to fuel success

778
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,760
with success and I know it's a kind of a

779
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,060
a bit of a naive conclusion very but I

780
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,480
needed to put a positive and optimistic

781
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,420
message into this I just wanted to thank

782
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,940
you to thank all the community for being

783
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,560
here for energizing ourselves and

784
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,220
keeping this motivation and this energy

785
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,920
to to keep doing our jobs as uh as

786
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,380
properly and as well as we can

787
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,780
and that's it

788
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:07,489
[Applause]

789
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,859
thank you very much Sabine for this

790
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:11,940
great talk

791
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,500
um we have some time left if there's

792
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,060
people who want to ask questions

793
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,119
thank you very much Sabine for a very

794
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,880
excellent talk it uh it was really nice

795
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,700
to um generally speaking relate to a lot

796
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,680
of things that you said as a blue teamer

797
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,240
and

798
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,400
um my question is about another topic

799
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,260
that security teams have to struggle

800
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,540
with budget

801
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,640
so

802
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,859
do you have any recommendation for teams

803
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,660
that are not there yet that are still

804
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,420
trying to develop the language or I

805
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,400
don't know the the tools to convince

806
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,859
management about some of the

807
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:54,660
necessary investment that needs to be

808
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,480
done that's my question thank you

809
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,880
thanks uh well thanks for being here

810
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,160
thanks for your question

811
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,200
um here

812
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,440
um in my experience there are two things

813
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,200
that

814
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,859
can can help on the to get a bit more

815
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,859
budget first one you won't like it it's

816
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:20,040
crisis incidents you you go through

817
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,359
something big and well

818
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,339
then yeah you get more budgets job

819
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,980
openings and so on but yeah that's not

820
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,020
the nice way of getting there

821
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,660
the other one is something

822
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,440
um

823
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,960
I don't adhere to but it can work is to

824
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,900
compare yourself with peers and saying

825
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,500
okay look at that company in the same

826
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,060
domain of activity or it's you know

827
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,540
comparable size of company and they've

828
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,300
done this and this and that and they're

829
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,079
way ahead of us in terms of maturity

830
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,619
that's you know can can sometimes with

831
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,960
some people hit in the right place

832
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,119
foreign

833
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,740
thank you first of all I have a question

834
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,560
related to ransomware so I heard it in

835
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,720
this talk but I hear it in a lot of

836
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,599
small companies and large companies the

837
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
biggest fear and risk is being hit by

838
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,500
ransomware

839
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,660
so a lot of companies they start

840
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,640
ransomware resilience against Arkansas

841
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,460
Readiness

842
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,859
projects but mostly they're focusing on

843
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:43,079
compliance do we have a policy do we

844
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,180
have a procedure to have an EDR do we

845
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,160
have a vulnerability management process

846
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,380
in place but actually you should be

847
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,619
focusing on the effectiveness of all the

848
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,260
procedures and tooling is there any

849
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,359
advice you have from a large company

850
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,240
such as Don owner how to measure the

851
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,180
effectiveness of all your solutions that

852
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,660
are in place

853
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,740
measure Effectiveness oh that's uh I was

854
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,920
talking about expertise earlier and

855
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,020
that's not my best area

856
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,960
I fully agree with you it's not only

857
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,480
about compliance and and having

858
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,839
processes written and so on

859
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,099
um well I obviously focus on the

860
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:33,500
technical measures we have the tooling

861
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,040
detection and response tooling

862
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,420
quarantining Network segregation

863
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,540
whatever

864
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,420
measuring Effectiveness on this

865
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,180
to be fully honest with you I don't

866
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,339
think that's even possible

867
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:51,900
because

868
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,640
the risk is is really big and you can

869
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,520
put all the detection and response

870
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,160
measures in place being you know you

871
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,760
have all the the the Box uh ticked

872
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,520
you're all green and then you have

873
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,160
someone opening a port on the internet

874
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,900
uh

875
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,200
I don't know VPN access RDP SSH whatever

876
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,339
and it's a door in and you're done

877
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,980
so with for all your Effectiveness

878
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,260
measurement

879
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,140
risk zero doesn't exist again so sorry

880
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,079
it's not really an answer but a

881
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:34,760
difficult topic it is

882
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,200
I think

883
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,220
first of all hello first of all thanks

884
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,680
for your talk and the inspiration

885
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,160
uh you talked a lot about fighting and

886
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,740
um and war against uh something what

887
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,800
happened but my question is about how

888
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,000
are you doing

889
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,839
um and it's near the budget thing how

890
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,540
how improve you the mindset change in

891
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,140
the organization

892
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,500
very difficult

893
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,220
again using incidents

894
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,619
internal or external ones that usually

895
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:28,319
quite effective when you say okay that

896
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,220
company they are totally down because of

897
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,200
what of what happened because of this

898
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,900
because of a phishing email or something

899
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:42,740
like that so using examples really helps

900
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:45,079
um

901
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,540
penetration tests and red teaming helps

902
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,500
as well you know to have the proof that

903
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,380
uh that yeah they gone in and it was

904
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,560
easy or difficult whatever but uh but uh

905
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,579
that usually helps create

906
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:03,300
um

907
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,880
well helps how to say this in English

908
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,700
realization for for managers and

909
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,500
Executives that something needs to be

910
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,880
done

911
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,040
there's no magical recipe there but

912
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,980
yeah let's we can we can try discussing

913
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,140
it afterwards I think it's a long topic

914
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,660
foreign

915
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,040
yeah I agree with you I agree with you

916
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,800
no me neither but for example you know

917
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,079
the

918
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:18,680
awareness is also about the users

919
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,599
lots of people are blaming the users for

920
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,760
clicking uh and and putting the

921
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,740
responsibility on them

922
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,880
when I talk to users I try to encourage

923
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,880
them to tell them you're also a line of

924
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,280
defense you can help us protect the

925
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,619
company you can hit the report

926
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:40,560
suspicious button in in your email in

927
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,920
your mailbox to to help us detect

928
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,500
anything weird and if you do that then

929
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,740
we will check who else in the company

930
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:52,200
received the email and we can quarantine

931
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,540
and so on and so on so

932
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,560
we try to empower them with uh well

933
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,839
that's what I do Empower them with the

934
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:04,020
belief that they can help whenever they

935
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,619
have a doubt they hit the button

936
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:10,619
and if they don't well again we are the

937
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,720
last line of defense and we'll try to

938
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,140
make sure we we catch it and and so on

939
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,640
but you need to reach to all the users

940
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,460
that's a huge challenge

941
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,680
and yeah it doesn't work with with

942
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,280
everyone and it doesn't work with um for

943
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,720
the

944
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,180
management awareness part and budget

945
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,579
Parts it's all different uh different

946
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,440
topics and yeah I haven't found the

947
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,700
magical recipe yet either

948
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:47,180
any other questions

949
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,119
no then I think thank you again thank

950
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,619
you for being here and for the great

951
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,800
talk
