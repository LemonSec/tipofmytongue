1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,400
so let me be the first one to officially

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,519
welcome everyone to our 14th Edition

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,720
thank you for being here

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,400
it's been a journey for us as well I

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,080
mean the journey started about two years

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,420
ago looking for a new building right

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,820
when we used to be engent in the Allah

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,800
we got a good spot over there we enjoyed

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,840
it over there we like the city we like

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,820
the environment but yet they started

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,500
with their reconstruction so we had to

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
go and search for a new place

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,940
we literally went around the whole

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,160
country we did we did different cities

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,620
visit different areas but we want to

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,420
find something that's captured the vibe

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,920
of Brooklyn right we don't want a

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
standard conference with a fixed carpet

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,940
thingy but we want to have a location

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,920
which is close to a city where we can

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,899
host all the workshops in one building

22
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,719
where we have some atmosphere and look

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,239
what we found an old building where they

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,920
used to make beer

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,160
how good is that I mean what else it's

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,619
it's a perfect match so we really hope

27
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,720
you enjoy this new location we think

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,460
it's awesome it really fits what we want

29
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,860
to achieve we're really glad that again

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,360
we were so popular that we've been

31
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,820
selling out we see the attention we see

32
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,619
how people look at the building how they

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,720
enjoy this environment first it's great

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,580
and literally that's the only thing we

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,299
need from you guys so thank you for that

36
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,500
so

37
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,049
[Applause]

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,280
it's a building with several floors if

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,619
you you've already seen but we have

40
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,720
things to do on every floor so first

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,439
downstairs the general area with the

42
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,939
sponsors who are supporting us you'll be

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,740
getting food and drinks over there

44
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,200
if you're the aula next door there's a

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,060
room where we where we're live streaming

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,860
the presentations here

47
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,600
you can also follow there if this room

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,979
would be full

49
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,439
then upstairs we have awesome retro for

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,600
some retro gaming setup and also the ICS

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,920
Village so don't forget to check these

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,340
out as well

53
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,899
so there's going to be some additional

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,240
slots open for the workshops so we're

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
going to open it literally right now so

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,280
we can start registering I know so it's

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,379
kind of first one first serve right so

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,060
first come first serve but that's great

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,599
so we're gonna open that uh I think uh

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,340
what else did we really like said

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,900
do check out the entire floors the

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,879
workshops will be here in around you do

63
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,560
tend to get a little bit lost in the

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,000
building that's fine you'll find your

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
way around I'm sure that's going to be

66
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,260
okay the the cell phone reception isn't

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,060
all that great but we have a stronger

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,040
Wi-Fi compared to other years so we

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,340
advise you to use the Wi-Fi carefully as

70
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,819
we all do right so I think this was

71
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,200
pretty much everything that we want to

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,060
mention today there's the digital

73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,099
booklet has been uploaded to the website

74
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,319
as well so you can check out the updated

75
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,200
scat in there so do check it out

76
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,180
sometimes some slots tend to move a

77
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,640
little bit depending on how speakers we

78
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,019
have one speaker who fell ill

79
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,459
unfortunately and is going to give his

80
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,620
talk tomorrow uh virtually so through

81
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,400
the stream

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,099
so we didn't so anyway

83
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,660
um I think that's kind of the message

84
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,940
that we want to bring so I first of all

85
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,560
and last of all we sure want to thank

86
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
the entire crew and all the volunteers

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,900
who are helping out
