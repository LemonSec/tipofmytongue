1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,639
hello everyone

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,620
thank you for being at our first

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,359
Brooklyn

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,470
I hope you like the venue

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,940
[Applause]

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,619
first time in a new venue is always a

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:17,460
bit

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,779
exciting you don't know what to expect

9
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,980
but so far we're very happy so uh

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,420
first thing we want to start with

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,820
there's a sponsor contest Stephen you

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
have some prizes to give away

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,720
you're gonna draw something from a

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,199
magical box

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
foreign

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
I think so yeah so I have a key pair

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,500
here

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,379
it's a symmetric key pair of course

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,180
so as we say in Dutch you need an

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,460
innocent hand to do this but we didn't

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,219
find those so I'm the I'm the victim

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,239
here

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,920
so we've been counting we have had

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,899

25

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,520

28

I got some stats about the network it

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,220
shouldn't be surprising and luckily we

84
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,199
see more and more encryption the wall of

85
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,520
sheep is getting less and less

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,080
interesting

87
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,180
we do see many people using corporate

88
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,400
laptops connecting to the Wi-Fi

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,979
interesting host names we could find

90
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,479
some information

91
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,580
and we see that many of those laptops

92
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,080
and in general the laptops are not

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,699
really hardened as they should be to

94
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:15,660
connect to

95
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,479
