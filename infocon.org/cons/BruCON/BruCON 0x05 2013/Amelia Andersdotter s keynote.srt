who so each time when you enter one of
these rooms you have to bring

12
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,789
but not in you in the oil-rich

13
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:21,690
saw the launch is out there and there's
three other rooms

14
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,610
workshop rooms in another building
besides the West lead investigator is

15
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,360
just

16
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,410
next to this room Redmayne workshops on
disaster noon and three other

17
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,800
rooms are in Novotel which is a five
minute walk from here

18
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,930
am and there's three rooms there

19
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,190
now these rooms can take 30 people and
there's no online registration system

20
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,419
for their so it's all based on a
first-come first-served basis

21
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,909
gotta love these workshops will be
repeated so if you miss one you come

22
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:52,210
can try again next time I'm

23
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,479
couple of other practical things at this
in the brochure

24
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,810
there's the details how to connect to
the wifi now you only have limited wifi

25
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,360
so don't packets

26
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,860
and don'ts like use torrents or

27
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,000
video streaming or whatever on its so
that we can all enjoy it

28
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,750
I'm desserts are going to be sold

29
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,590
as also a the first break at reception

30
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,530
and there is going to be streaming of
the event a small bit stream will not be

31
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,530
accessible here

32
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,840
in the the building because the bandits

33
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
one important thing who've you haz

34
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
has drinks year okay

35
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,330
and don't don't bring drinks and food in
this room

36
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,380
I'm the the university's really picky
about keeping his room in the status

37
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,490
we had remarks last year so please don't
bring any drinks and food Indies

38
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:55,120
in this area okay now a couple of
program updates

39
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,270
so we are seeing already have Justin I
tell as keynote

40
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,190
he could make its but we're very happy
to have fun really undersell to

41
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,060
replacing him

42
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,760
just of these few words and have David

43
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,419
mom this after noon or evening as a
second keynote today

44
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,699
replacing around phoenix now

45
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,990
the schedule will always be a date it's
its online scandal broke onto

46
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,560
or I'm is also mentioned in here
together with a QR codes that are owned

47
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,070
slights so this will be streams

48
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,219
so for people that come join here inform
them

49
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,810
to introduce this URL so that people out
sites

50
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,870
the event can also enjoy it

51
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,449
no

52
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,169
for you don't know what this is we
started this

53
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,270
as a non-profit organization dissolve
run by volunteers nobody's

54
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,760
being paid for this I'm but we did a lot
but did a good job last year

55
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,520
in the sense that we made a profit and
that's that's a that's a problem for

56
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,099
non-profit organization you have to
spend on something

57
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:05,289
so what we've done is we've donate its
money to projects

58
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:09,289
in open source area and that align with
our mission so there's three projects

59
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,380
which you can see here

60
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,889
which have received money and we're
going to repeat is this year's

61
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,909
again and we're also france is
sponsoring other events like this year

62
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:21,060
own in the Netherlands response by brick
almost fell

63
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,190
no

64
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,539
one of the things which makes it
possible to organized is and two key to

65
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,300
take it slow

66
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,949
is the is the sponsoring I'm there's a
couple sponsors

67
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,079
out sites please visit them give them
some law of

68
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,180
its they're here to keep our ticket
prices low

69
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,959
so big thank you to the diamond sponsor

70
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,470
the party sponsor re-elected for his
evening and yours

71
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,750
helping to say and coming together
already talked about to do because we

72
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,130
have a party this evening

73
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,470
as of 9:30 it is also mentioned in the
book

74
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:01,459
where the the location where it is its
also not very far

75
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,770
and it's in the six and throw and there
is going to be

76
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,990
some really also in the chase playing
there so it's highly recommend it

77
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,459
to make thats now

78
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,890
if you want to volunteer and hopeless
organizing this there's a volunteer

79
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,880
mailing lists

80
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,130
which conjoined and bill be posting

81
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,350
regular updates from there as well for
it this year or next year

82
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,260
but most importantly enjoy this
conference have fun

83
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,959
I'm basically in joints

84
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,569
and after you've done its let this year
how you find its

85
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,910
we have the some online feedback forms

86
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,920
which you can fill in at this is your
own QR codes

87
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,120
and let us know how you will find it and
we can improve it or feedback

88
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,120
okay

89
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,069
so I will give there were two a media
I'm still turf

90
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:07,069
our first keynote ever become false

91
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:19,990
yes

92
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,640
soweto everybody my name is a man down
them an elected member of the European

93
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,620
Parliament for

94
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,960
the Pirate Party from sweet

95
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,400
and so many happy to be here

96
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,770
I don't want to speak to you today about
the electronic identification regulation

97
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,550
which was proposed by the European
Commission in 2012

98
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,020
in July suddenly working with this in
the European Parliament for the last

99
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,490
year

100
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,620
and it's actually in many ways a very
good

101
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,450
illustration ok many of the a big
questions that are facing society right

102
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:55,860
now

103
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,430
about society and facing society about
the internet

104
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,960
identity surveillance BBC security and
how these things relate

105
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,690
to individuals and their society sewn

106
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,740
first of all what does the regulation
aimed to do the regulation aims to give

107
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,840
people in different Member States a way
of accessing e-government services

108
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,810
in other European countries so and this
is the Belgian

109
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,180
tax authority and you can log in with
your your ID card to pay your taxes

110
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,000
and so and when the specific
e-government service in a member state

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,190
requires some type of authentication

112
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,280
this regulation means to make it
possible for citizen for Member State

113
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,140
be for instance to go to member states
a.m. say I want to authenticate myself

114
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,980
but my members they be significant some

115
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,050
the problem is that over the last
fifteen or twenty years member states

116
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,840
have chosen

117
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,250
many different ways issuing an atomic
identification

118
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,990
a.m. another problem is that there's a
general perception that

119
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,850
electronic identification hasn't been
very successfully implemented or adopted

120
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,220
by

121
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,290
citizens consumers businesses and so
forth

122
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,680
so rather than using government-issued
identification

123
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,990
on the Internet citizens feel more
comfortable relying on their facebook

124
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,040
login or

125
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
in many cases sexually citizens will
create a different logins for different

126
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,800
services

127
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,340
probably a lot of you have accounts and
different types of social media that

128
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,000
pass officer identities from time to
time so there's been some bushes to work

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,390
stuff like Open ID

130
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,250
but Open ID doesn't fulfill the
requirements that the government would

131
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,970
have to put

132
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,950
on its own services so if you're going
to use that tax

133
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,460
authority for instance it's clear that
Open ID doesn't provide you with

134
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,640
sufficient security

135
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,990
a.m. and this is the same thing with
health care things that normally you

136
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,900
want a stronger typeof indication that
the current systems

137
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,240
provider so them

138
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,590
but the electronic identification is
also something that we expect companies

139
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,110
to use

140
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,140
European Union has presently been making
procurement on the Internet

141
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,280
mandatory so everyone who wants to sell
a service to a public institution would

142
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,180
have to

143
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,050
use some kind of indication to access
the procurement system

144
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,670
and without being about 25 percent I
think

145
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,220
European GDP I it makes it very urgent
for us to have

146
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,520
strong and very like verifiable waz

147
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,140
ensuring but a public authority is in
fact in contact with the right onto no

148
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,410
otherwise you could end up wasting my
money

149
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,030
some these solutions often rely on
certificates or cryptographic

150
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,870
certificates

151
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,420
and therefore the commission is also
aimed to regulate what they call trusted

152
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,320
service providers

153
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,420
these trusted service providers would be

154
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,680
more known for many have you as a
certificate authorities

155
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm but many member states

156
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,190
rely on what they called one but the
call qualified

157
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,390
trusted service providers and sewer
qualified like

158
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,700
somebody who fulfils specific
requirement in practice the

159
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,480
qualification just means that the member
state recognizes that the qualified

160
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,720
certificate to secure

161
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,750
and reliable in a given transaction but
the government and the rules will have

162
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,860
to qualify certificates are derived from
European directive from 1999

163
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,200
but it was never really Houston

164
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,390
I love the member states and so for
instance in Sweden we've never relied on

165
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,320
qualified certificates and is that he is
just normal certificates

166
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,630
the fact that there's this discrepancy
between the Commission

167
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,940
terminology that they say that this is a
trusted service provider in

168
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,350
and normally in technical terms you talk
about certificate authorities that the

169
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:32,000
CA's

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,720
meant to be a problem for us in the
parliament because it meant that

171
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,940
a lot of the technical discussions
around the problems up CA's

172
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,590
weren't accessible to us because they
were described in the language that we

173
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,600
didn't understand

174
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,440
and so I think they Commission could
have done a better job than

175
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,280
proposing that qualified certificate
authorities in member states have also

176
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,990
suffered a number of problems over the
years so the rules from 1999 are not

177
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,760
very good

178
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,400
the deed in order to failure in the
Netherlands is probably the most

179
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,700
notable example and it's clearly on
convenient for them

180
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,110
government when something that the dildo
failure happens

181
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,340
and some in this proposal we try to fix

182
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,940
interoperability between different
Member State solutions for electronic

183
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,790
identification

184
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,090
and to fix the problem that sometimes in

185
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,090
we have valuable CA's and and

186
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,760
the fact that we don't know what to do
when you see a fails

187
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,000
and the regulation was proposed more
lesson into

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,910
different parts and so the first part
covers the electronic identification

189
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,610
and the second part covers the trust
service providers

190
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,970
or certificate authorities thereabouts
20 articles which only set up criteria

191
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,480
for what should be

192
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,560
considered secure and so

193
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,800
a.m. be in this a joke was that this
will boost be

194
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,370
European Union into the future and it
remains to be seen

195
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,660
consumed the problem is that electronic
identification is also going to a touchy

196
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,600
subject

197
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,520
for many member states I'm in some
Member States like an island a great

198
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,050
britain

199
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,070
government-issued ID cards is like the
most controversial thing every time its

200
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,920
proposed

201
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,940
the population completely eat riots

202
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:21,050
and the government has been unsuccessful
in implementing a central registry

203
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,960
in other member states like in germany
are many Central European

204
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,770
countries they have constitutions which
require very strict separation of

205
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,220
various forms of citizen

206
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,300
identities with respect to the
government as soon

207
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,890
you will have the healthcare persona or
tax authority persona and essentially

208
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,830
the government is

209
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,510
banned from linking these different
personas together

210
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm the ideas that

211
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,700
of course if the government in these
countries would be able to collect too

212
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,400
much information on every

213
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,120
citizen interaction with the government
that could lead to very negative

214
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,220
consequences for the Citizen

215
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,580
especially if you end up with the
government doesn't

216
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,660
want the best for the people

217
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,070
in my member states we don't and in the
many other member states like this to

218
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,680
know if in the end we have

219
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,130
a national number that is unique at for
every individual

220
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,910
and that helps the government cross from
that a basis if it wants to

221
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,180
and in at least Sweden this used to be
the not so easy to do

222
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,650
like ross running the data basis but of
course with information technology is

223
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,580
being deployed never parted

224
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,540
society now it's much more simple to get
a very all-encompassing you up how

225
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,700
every citizen interacts with the
government at every turn

226
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,850
and so we had a lot of criticism is
freedom the last few years about

227
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,100
whether the national numbers necessary
but we have yet to

228
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,620
see it from the European Commission's
proposal strangely avoided most of the

229
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,440
controversies

230
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,630
with the different Member State to call
just identification

231
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,690
and it was some largely a bold move

232
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,260
on how to make different types of
electronic stamps signatures

233
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,350
the the idea that

234
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,710
yeah and the idea is to basically tell
public authorities in member states what

235
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,370
they have to consider a truthful are
verified

236
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,360
and dissident too much confusion in the
European Parliament

237
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,130
both from the I don't I said already on
the trust service part but also some

238
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,390
we are not the technical institution but
a political institutions

239
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,010
to we cannot consider ourselves the best
agents to make technical decisions

240
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,770
forward is true in January nor what is
not true and genuine in technical terms

241
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,900
it's even a fact that many different
Member States use different systems for

242
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,280
establishing but it's true are generally
nso

243
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,360
with different backgrounds have members
of the European Parliament

244
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,190
and we had problem seeing by this file
it would be

245
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,010
at all interesting from either a
political or technical

246
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,970
perspective essentially the Commission
had made it to technical and they

247
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,500
avoided the political issues that could
actually be interesting to discuss

248
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,320
in the context of but this 5

249
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,280
arm but it turned out later that the
European Union has sponsored a lot of

250
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,690
research programs

251
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,920
about why this file could be interesting

252
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,030
actually also from a political
perspective and so some other

253
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,530
researchers that the European Commission
had previously given money

254
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,700
from came to us in the parliament to
express their point of view

255
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,740
the first thing is like identity is a
very

256
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,850
philosophical concept Who Am I

257
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,720
and what are we what is Europe and

258
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,190
many people spend their entire life
pondering these issues and and most of

259
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,670
us never reach satisfactory answers

260
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,260
so arm we also have the issue like what
is my identity in relationship to the

261
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,290
government what does it mean that you
have a health care persona but respect

262
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:44,890
to the

263
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,900
German government that cannot be
connected with your police records are

264
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,830
your tax records would

265
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,170
what are all these identities how do you
deal with them

266
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,820
and this is where the different
approaches to be different member states

267
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,040
a.m. with many different cultural
backgrounds and history so governor and

268
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,510
governance and governments and gives us
many different dances like what is the

269
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,190
appropriate relationship to establish
between

270
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,130
a personal identity and anti-government

271
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,430
it's no question that the European
Commission hope to avoid by introducing

272
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,790
interoperability framework for the
various member state solutions

273
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,690
so that everyone could keep their own
solution and their own answers while at

274
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,890
the same time allowing their citizens to
interact with the public services

275
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,870
other member states I'm

276
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,820
but the European Commission sponsored
much research in this field over the

277
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,510
last few years including flagship
programs like really ambitious

278
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,860
study so what to information and

279
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,160
booking information technologies mean
one of them is this feed a statement

280
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,480
and i actually very much recommend some
of the results its

281
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,910
future identity in the information
society

282
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:59,240
from the people that i spoke to in
October or November last year

283
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,290
would be from ABC for trust or

284
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:07,030
attribution based credentials for trust
how do you build a trustworthy

285
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:12,150
authentication and identification
systems in digital environments

286
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,350
and and I understood

287
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,760
on hearing the explanation abuse
research programs that the Commission

288
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,490
had actually rather

289
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,590
cautiously decided to discard most of
the major investments that they

290
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,250
themselves had made

291
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,910
in figuring out how to make peace
authentication services work for

292
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,710
citizens in a previously

293
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,730
from the way and that is a bit stupid
because actually privacy is

294
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,470
and something but we have made a lot of
investments are able to get a lot of

295
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,130
market advantages also soon the problem
for

296
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,220
in government says that were forced to
interact with them in a number of

297
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,430
circumstances we can't help but fighting
look some information about ourselves

298
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,290
our families our age situation and
housing for to the tax office the tax

299
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,230
authorities need that information and

300
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,060
and so but it's a lot of information
about us

301
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,520
persons and which it which if it is
arbitrarily spread around can lead to

302
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,990
very negative consequences for us in our

303
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,420
working lives with their friends
families schools in

304
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,330
other things so we generally expect
confidentiality of some sort from a tax

305
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:14,930
authorities

306
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,370
it's the same thing but health or dental
care services

307
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,460
we more or less have to interact with
these public services

308
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,130
at least until illegally adult schools
social services the Jobcentre the

309
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,600
government forces to interact with them
in any number of ways the pecans choose

310
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,390
not to

311
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,240
and so because that is a force
interaction that we can't escape

312
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,560
you would imagine that politically begun
to think very carefully about

313
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,400
how these interactions are set up

314
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,860
the government will normally one of the
services and the general privacy from

315
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,910
the idea of that because it's no so easy
to cross from databases

316
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,800
and cross reference databases the
interactions need to be on linkable

317
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,440
so the German Constitutional idea
basically that you can't

318
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,870
take a database from one service
cross-references

319
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:04,470
with another service so that you get to
view our how your

320
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:11,030
income is related to your health record
for instance

321
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,250
it should not be possible to find out
that you the citizen in the same

322
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,470
day has ordered a committee a test on
the Public Health Service website

323
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,550
and then filled in your tax returns or
requested a building permit

324
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,070
and the ideal moment ability is is very
strong in the German constitution

325
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,330
so in germany it's mandated by the
Constitution the public authorities

326
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,720
don't cross trainer profile their own
citizens

327
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,150
based on the totality of the
interactions at

328
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,740
and so said unthinkable at: in this case

329
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,930
means that um you stop one party which
is a very powerful

330
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,270
from getting too much information there
for too much power over another party

331
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,020
which is very wheat and in Germany the
way the implemented Eide they were very

332
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,770
strict about enforcing the unthinkable
iti principle because it's

333
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,000
it's a very strong principle in Germany

334
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,300
that is partially derived from their
experiences in the second world war

335
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,990
in in Sweden be rather have many
specialized loss for government

336
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,290
registers we restrict the ability

337
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,590
or the public authority to cross run
databases with another public authority

338
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,820
or service

339
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,900
and the national numbers that we give to
every

340
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,680
precedent in the country makes it of
course possible to cross from the

341
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,540
databases

342
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,840
anyway should we need to but we expect
for public authorities to follow the law

343
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,270
firm

344
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,870
and we don't particularly stringently
implement this technologically

345
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:37,920
soon the idea that one could want in
some cases to have a mink ability exists

346
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,350
a good booked we not

347
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,860
we're not using a technical construction
to actually enforce this

348
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,960
parent to or to live up to the spirit of
the law a secular

349
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,140
and also because apparently you public
authorities in Sweden frequently cell

350
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,190
that about citizens to private companies
one could imagine that

351
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,020
actually the aggregation of all the
interactions happen with some

352
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,610
happens now with some private party
rather than with the public authorities

353
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,580
themselves

354
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,640
and thus reduces the massive loss which

355
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,630
also and using did talk more about make

356
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,160
but the EU research projects had made a
different inside

357
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,780
also so in order to reduce the size the
databases and therefore reduce the harm

358
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,130
in security features our data leaks

359
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,210
and protect the privacy of users and the
confidentiality of interactions

360
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,920
one could use something called anonymous
authentication for attribution base

361
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,110
credentials

362
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,940
this is when you only provide the
information necessary for a specific

363
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,380
purpose to identify yourself

364
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,420
if it was needed for me to demonstrate
that I'm legally allowed to buy tobacco

365
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,290
products

366
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,600
I would demonstrate that I'm in fact not
born in the nineteen ninety five or

367
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
later the 1995

368
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,000
rather than demonstrating that I'm a
born on august thirtieth nineteen

369
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,250
eighty-seven

370
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,480
there is something down a trail from
that ok with indication would be

371
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,170
information about someone born before
nineteen

372
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,890
95 used a service rather than i'm leon

373
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,170
I me on the stuff that it 1987 or 830

374
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,090
has used to service so were well in the
first case its relative relatively

375
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,620
difficult

376
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,220
even after a doubt I'll that elite to
link the use of the Service Pack two me

377
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,440
as a person

378
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,050
in the second case it is nearly
inevitable that if there isn't that a

379
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,000
week somebody will know that it was
exactly me that use that service and so

380
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,290
this is quite previously from being to
me up

381
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,200
at this time it seemed because this was
like two

382
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,940
November 2012 it had seemed to me very
stupid that the Commission disregarded

383
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,270
the

384
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,270
was to move their own research programs

385
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,380
and that we furthermore not considering
the institutional effects available so

386
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,929
they had

387
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:45,940
before us when you make an electronic
identification system you are

388
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,070
determining the interactions between a
citizen and the government thing it

389
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,360
seems to me that you should

390
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,560
think a bit about how these interactions
working we hadn't done that

391
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,800
and so of course some great previously
minded and I believe the preservation

392
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,340
previous is an essential aspect

393
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,530
maintaining a good power balance between
individuals groups governments and

394
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,030
companies

395
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,270
and so I wanted politically to advance
the idea

396
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,330
are linked ability in attribution base
credentials

397
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,150
when the problem is that I have this
kinda long and messy and seemingly very

398
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,660
technical file that made very little
sense

399
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:23,130
and 20 arguments 20 articles out of 40
only establishing various random

400
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,690
security criteria that I have no
competence or skill to evaluate

401
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,770
and this possum problem for me

402
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:34,380
assume for those and you don't know how
the European Parliament works we are

403
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,340
allowed to go in then

404
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,020
and change texts that the Commission
proposes proposes

405
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,030
even when we have a text which looks
seemingly im messy a large we can

406
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,260
actually ourselves

407
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,880
amend that text a until we're satisfied
with it

408
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,180
and but it's very challenging to write a
good technical regulation actually on

409
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,390
the Cassation is quite difficult to

410
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,400
arrived at the scene meet me compromise
from

411
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
think about the texts and soon the
European Parliament

412
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,770
Germany too much also very

413
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,070
mission because it's difficult to do so
would

414
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,330
majority from Yuniesky these enormous
amount

415
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,920
changes that we will do you were from me
shower

416
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,440
were could deliver

417
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,610
were winds you expect that this is okay
Brotherhood

418
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,570
overall the General Committee event
commission established

419
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,940
and so I was in the situation I'm
completely

420
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,130
radio with the emission-line

421
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,730
and that wasn't

422
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,110
sOooo at the same time that I was
thinking

423
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:47,360
this isn't good you members decided

424
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,900
so good at the same time but I was
working on this in the European

425
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,400
Parliament

426
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,330
I was looking for a lot of information
about different systems members say

427
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,730
and most importantly from the parliament
fine of course in the ideal

428
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,020
a that is normally seen as unsuccessful
nvm

429
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,000
me about 10 percent over last year's
hood

430
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,540
and there's no room service working
around the 15 private doctors using

431
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,600
him the government services you clearly
who's 28

432
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,920
yes absent minded it's these smartphones

433
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,390
and CEO millions from smart cards yes
I'm

434
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,800
and France that sounds like fun CEO just
don't like them

435
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,120
I'm yet worked really hard for several
years

436
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,600
for some some Samm

437
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,940
I did so which took place

438
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,150
other forms of the authentication landed
you since the day we had

439
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,380
for a long time and now I'm some for

440
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,750
would me get different hyperpigmentation

441
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,230
I me about that issue said that this is
upsetting because

442
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,020
some identity federation said

443
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,830
be used in fact a and so the only me

444
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,700
your transactions for the government
isn't so top

445
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,070
and bonuses that and so I'm

446
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:18,540
be would happen if boy featured on this
this and this and that

447
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,880
you have to tell you provided who you're
going to need

448
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,960
and that means that provided to be done
Grafton's with the

449
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,800
before salute missus services and health
services in India

450
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,370
whatever other the job centre whatever
public services your

451
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,580
your way yeah and if I didn't know him
access to school

452
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,310
at the same day in the studio index
examples

453
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,370
you're actually do you see online

454
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,720
you don't will you know indication me

455
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,990
and some good Federation

456
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,660
the Identity Provider he said and know
that

457
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,430
I'm upset about this because I think
that

458
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,950
the decision to use this particular
technical standards the latest

459
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,960
if from you see all that attention

460
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,260
for it's obvious that means it isn't you

461
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:20,850
life services IT guy from there

462
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,720
this server and even because the next
half

463
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,660
maybe citizens government services you

464
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,290
move to someone somewhere he plays
everything to do with that

465
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:38,880
and see if billions were not so happy
about the government's decision to

466
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
implement the system

467
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,850
because the hood undermine their provide
us with this incident

468
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,790
since they are who would be identified
they felt that the good

469
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,830
guaranteed to their citizens that this
is Amber sir

470
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,350
United and you didn't see me give you
another

471
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:02,390
its citizens in their day-to-day affairs
today they have to have a system

472
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,540
agent and citizens and not

473
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,690
and very good good

474
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,180
love I'm for everyone you would

475
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,560
medium don't think I've decided
Federation

476
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,660
your affiliation with any decision and
no

477
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,750
yes thousand pages a day

478
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,940
do you miss it however how wasn't

479
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,610
were me currency

480
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,990
am reason for this is good first

481
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,450
Louis summers who is a

482
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,250
taking them identification universal

483
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,280
he's very good Federation he's very good

484
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,370
his University's using the good and some
when the government

485
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,320
medium so new york usually eat

486
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,690
decision which my so well and i cant

487
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,900
good most giuliani system

488
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,300
preconditions day but to see hits my

489
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,850
services governments from municipal

490
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,990
I'm national government very differently
from the University

491
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,290
not the same and so there's no
indication system the birds month

492
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,520
also works and

493
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,600
at the national level and i can
understand it if you're going to be good

494
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,790
by you know that but weird over four
years

495
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,390
investigations thought that somebody in
the government would have thought about

496
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:31,870
that

497
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,980
because the company goes on this is
another the lineup

498
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,140
institutions mumble soon I miss

499
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,780
that is very worrying that nobody would

500
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,210
I'm the national numbers

501
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,250
which I mentioned which makes me believe
very busy

502
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,930
Houston for many years assume a local
one

503
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,640
and so I Yemen's 3 from want

504
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,880
picky people like this Federation said

505
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,350
yeah you aggression if solution

506
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,919
even though we have the same trucked in
from gym into Federation

507
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,720
because USDA's the National number long

508
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,180
that and

509
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,580
boat the things you do you have the
number two thousand McDonald on the

510
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,980
basis of

511
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,530
this so edgy an international number

512
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:33,399
said United four months to figure out
that

513
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,520
that's the fundamental snow them that be
considered themselves just good

514
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,060
which is %um acceptable but then the
oath said

515
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,480
and I'm someone

516
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,500
a genuine dispute if recently me

517
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,418
another time I good morning because this
is a man I realize that some people we

518
00:34:56,419 --> 00:34:57,490
will be meeting

519
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,470
this is being that the reason that we
have this identity federation defeated

520
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,740
estimated and so this is a him for all
the citizens instructions for the

521
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,790
government

522
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:11,520
me in the morning many be

523
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,410
patent system for citizens government by
the military

524
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:20,520
that I'm school and

525
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,530
some people who are you to become part
of this

526
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,040
Federation Instagram said about drug him

527
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,100
and the 1i practices good and me

528
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,670
used so that it would go away from

529
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,830
in that particular case I had a minor
things prices because

530
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,200
the major positioning system for a long
time

531
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,540
and in this case you want to join the
identification good

532
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,810
my political scientist from sometime

533
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,180
sometime later cast described said hit

534
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,260
compromises okay so it said

535
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,740
you have compromises nixon's how Beach

536
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:03,900
decision and you have to reach a
decision

537
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,180
but you have to do with the others so
you may have to compromise

538
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,630
to get a decision how much you water
down Essex

539
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,780
reached a decision you have to make a
actually

540
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,210
for anyone to ever use to make a
decision along with other people

541
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,410
I think that months the politics
location

542
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,680
the PSM good is actually good

543
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,080
my hands in this case a video bad

544
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,359
side they want no for them not to be
trappin

545
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:35,600
know that there was with jackson they
felt that the

546
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,950
good but when is a good time for action

547
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,930
someone who would time trusted not to
use of personal information about how

548
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,220
citizens who were

549
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,930
drug government be themselves
information is awarded

550
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,450
I'm but you have to be done is and the
government's actions of course the

551
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,609
government has access

552
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:01,280
he attacked in the sense that you keep
this information confidential

553
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,339
using good he will always mean that you
are participating in the truck

554
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,740
it's a compromise that to me we go and
attack yes

555
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,850
to ensure that there is no option but to
solicit and other options that may exist

556
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,020
but then it's a bad system government
medium

557
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,540
I said yet thing to do is not to
participate

558
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,690
and this because ultimately it's the
time facing themselves

559
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,950
lamented

560
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,140
it's not a particular you're just doing

561
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,310
doing good I'm

562
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,089
so enough is enough museums actually
parliamentarians in the national

563
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:43,200
parliament

564
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,100
be very clear about one thing: seen I'm

565
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,580
the same time vision system economically
and

566
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,750
moment and so on but does the same here
to stay

567
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,530
I from cedar and use the motion would

568
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,950
remember my to Syria if you think that

569
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,440
my mom good

570
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,420
have buddy be removed for remember
exactly how it works

571
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,790
and so many people ask me if you would
twice friends because they don't

572
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,700
remember

573
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,760
instead were and any

574
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,770
Sumer for me mission

575
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,960
required get some normally my

576
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,420
for this individual units for all
commercial transaction

577
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,950
for instance I'm access to information
about music is still a

578
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,280
if you ask friends two outs throughout
the day

579
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,500
chances are the one who got them back
you know somebody opened

580
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,280
himself which is no don't

581
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,339
so there's not really much crazy you
something I for

582
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:53,380
can I'm 128 much more difficult to
ensure that this was in the gym

583
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,430
facing occasion that happens all the
time

584
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,350
humans also don't sometime I can go to
my

585
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,670
dentist and if my face in myself

586
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,890
a computer he doesn't have his his
service on them

587
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,010
get myself in to see me time it's not
like

588
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,970
the disorder sided at some point

589
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,450
said and

590
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,630
so human tissue deformation issue we
can't forget

591
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,140
if you remind me provide information
computer you have to have to tell it to

592
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,030
forget

593
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,200
and then who that information from the
store

594
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,740
soon him any any

595
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,960
can only drive education system would
kinda redefinition of

596
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,180
am the same day but then

597
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,730
which seems someone the same the
previous year

598
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,670
individualism protective antigen
execution

599
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,000
we just everybody my stubbornness years
is protected

600
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,130
or I'm to see access and Jim

601
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,990
service protected was the beloved

602
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:03,920
Commission I know if

603
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,390
freely about posted rapid exchange

604
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,010
because it's a very political issue how
you balance however and information

605
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,339
Friday and this is exactly the feeling
we would normally expect politicians

606
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:18,620
he's very good

607
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,750
what should society who should have
booked no

608
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,890
mine how can that exercise how do we
ensure that uses a problem to be

609
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,450
resolved

610
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,010
so that it is

611
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,869
how to me soul conflicts that arise

612
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,950
when someone with however uses it

613
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,890
respect summitted I'm disease exam

614
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,359
be Federation is really beautiful story
of how

615
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,400
technology for republican juicy so much
the mini

616
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,830
that couldn't possible if this were
implemented with respect qualities

617
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,050
and its possibility expected

618
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:01,050
nowhere growth four years

619
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,609
four years investigation anyone
considered this is relationships with

620
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:07,910
our public services and every

621
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,950
is quite fundamental imaginations of
society

622
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,119
them but this year an official

623
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,880
legally society should in this case

624
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,450
somebody up there government for with on

625
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,970
but so were after I had minded about
this issue

626
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:30,970
for months the police he decided that
the one who European

627
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,339
mission bus items

628
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:38,099
%um so we're going back to the regular

629
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,910
ironside he's funny detectable a
political mistake

630
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,190
said some much because the Jimmy

631
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,960
whatever changes on dance I'm

632
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,369
I ended up doing something 141 me she
just

633
00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,700
beat us and you articles so that is OK

634
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,020
changes but it's very parliament will
lose

635
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,970
yes I

636
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,440
wish I could accomplish him politically
because I wanted without using too much

637
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,609
but actually missions that assume

638
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,010
so on thankful and soon committed

639
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,660
that was impossible to do any good

640
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,210
reminded I'm it is

641
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,559
baby didn't my funny stuff but I think
I'm ready

642
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:35,089
just like eccentric who I'm tolerated by

643
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,749
companies were for doing these things
mission

644
00:42:38,749 --> 00:42:44,180
which has also been said he isn't

645
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,369
feels like you don't want none pygmies

646
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:51,009
persons some for the pressure lugar
where and why

647
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:54,479
you want or whatever

648
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:58,559
further information about however what
to do with small to be sold to

649
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,380
advertisers

650
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,719
so that they can when he said persons
I'm

651
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,170
for the day moving this view from the
station is in the details

652
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,319
when he got proposal don't know
political aspect to it

653
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,959
because the Commission who avoids fights
States

654
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:19,289
I'm now I'm for

655
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:22,579
we have included in this that in the
moment

656
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:25,630
so I'm somehow becomes unbearable

657
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,880
concern that by now soon these problems
whatever

658
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,959
however if the government's got
something to believe what is that

659
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:34,519
musician

660
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,119
attributions themselves and we have that

661
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,170
legally and ethically this is a I'm not
insist on right

662
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,979
but the movie to made technical language

663
00:43:45,979 --> 00:43:49,400
said also right and so because I haven't

664
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,059
c'mon the proposals that for

665
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:57,509
the text that vote on yet I'm

666
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:01,660
very nervous about that if you want to
because if you made it

667
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,569
political choices my ability this duties
and obligations on the different bugs in

668
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:08,749
the system used to the idea of

669
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:13,079
for the system word and so it's
difficult but it's not obvious so much

670
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:13,529
to do

671
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:17,109
European Parliament ultimately good

672
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:20,759
isn't confusion but a political
institution beyond

673
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,829
resources that you need to do overhaul

674
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,769
poses like this but the Commission
proposal is the

675
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:34,189
spectacular day with but some

676
00:44:34,189 --> 00:44:37,979
what he just said

677
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:41,160
the him electronic communication
regulation

678
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,880
really good for the last year is realism

679
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,109
hood

680
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:52,369
so I think that he had to leave already

681
00:44:52,369 --> 00:44:55,589
NetWeaver protected see

682
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:58,660
what can we do what counted the would
you do

683
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,130
what is decide for ecology to do
particular

684
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:07,229
circumstance lives in with the Stars be
handled in the late 1990s the argument

685
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:10,799
we need special site us this is the
Lord's Day

686
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:12,120

687
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,930
he do tell David

688
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,470
it was the call confines a very specific
actions so if you want to do something

689
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:24,550
we have to make sure that would allow
system some people like

690
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,750
he did logistically

691
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,900
to deregulate make some sense today

692
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,730
I think that this is not going to sit at
cooperate

693
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,150
be segregated into Nazi emerged

694

know were cases but that

695
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,860
legislation that sucks was only stay and

696
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,270
saving it online services like bank band

697

become unmediated need to pass
immigration

698
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,620
speculate in its activities at the back
to

699
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,840
he's with I'm

700
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,100
we do you wanna take particularly yet
and deregulation

701
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:10,260

first week and so we want to ensure that
we are able to make the technologies and

706
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,840
humans

707
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,420
together good to be just like

708
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,560
this and soon

709
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,930
he's going through a very worthy at this
time the decision that I just had this

710
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,120
important

711
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,550
for the meeting that it would implement
be justified sin occasions and some

712

simple

716
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:03,000
you institutionally mood but they need
to make sure that it said

717
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,450
and it would be better if the Commission
will be able to do that

718
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,370
nationalisms mad up to you parliament

719
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,130

00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:02,069
to me because yes mini

786
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:05,140
you any this see

787
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:08,800
exception E mass day he didn't need

788
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,180
politicization today any

789
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,099
decisions a different day the problem is
how do you need

790
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,349
full any who people

791
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:22,660
and citizens BC actresses like

792
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:26,859
understand because I think politicians
me

793
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:30,599
United doing on the same

794
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,940
that he'd

795
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,300
I my everyday see

796
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,740
and $500 million people

797
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,790
which is good

798
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,410
and so how do you need miss them but
they have this power

799
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,859
you need governments in the state
understand here

800
00:52:50,859 --> 00:52:54,990
it's not good p

801
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:59,380
the state you didn't said

802
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,980
him to do with the day

803
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,160
it's meant to say free where he said

804
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,720
nobody's and you only see any

805
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,119
my kids public authorities you too

806
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,300

Information Technology said normal cited

808
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:26,069
rather good exceptional state movement
said

809
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:29,490
state does that make sense said

810
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:33,900
no imagery to the gym good

811
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:40,900
the reason that I did

812
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,670

813
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:53,670

to use the problems the me five million

820

in the company because the Sun 2006
Union forces

821
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:26,120
to do that which is good because you you
have to force the other members history

822
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,180
you need for speed in 2g the government

823
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,780
enforced in government and some

824

any good potentially very brutal 20
looking to you know that

827
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,320
what are we going to do let's for my
good

828
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,450
and below the national security morning
2012 communications monkeys

829
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:56,410
and love you did mississippi

830
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:00,160
in the sixth to you the that the problem

831
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,930
who sold with smoke his he's actually in

832
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:08,860
I'm were expecting any utilities

833
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:12,000
renewable energy do you have any

834
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,260
supply amendment and therefore we need
to have a very good

835
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,960
d-mass but the problem is you people in
his visa

836
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,030
countries and the man's you can hold the
key to get in time

837
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:27,800
day it's difficult to wash in the middle
of the night if you have keys

838
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,920
I specific hours a day you

839
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,080
media vigils perceive I was everyday

840
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,900
save energy use Google's you don't want
that sOooo

841
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:43,210
at desman this smart meter technology

842
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,620
see you have to leave a message for some
time solely

843
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,310
very good embassy and I meant

844
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:54,230
reduced used and it seems that so many

845
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:59,250
the 1980s people who you know that
there's him some business over the

846
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,790
median I'm

847
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,560
within the human eye smart media
companies even take this incident

848
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,150
just on this issue yousef uuuu

849
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:13,080
is my husband's and very excited about
this idea

850
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,500
he believed to be dead

851
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,110
same actually the following

852
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,420
new problems and they create a lot of
problems and so making bets for smart

853
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,980
meters sure we can do that

854
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,860
but what is the point I think probably
should be trying to sell

855
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,330
the actual problem that he hadn't

856
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,880
and be home to me you say

857
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,610
miss see me which is very interesting

858
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,020
perfect example of how would you sort
out the problem

859
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,450
you find a solution which doesn't
feature him

860
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:53,260
some you use disillusion to create a
problem

861
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:58,320
said you know was actually created by
the fact that you some

862
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:03,710
architects should visited

863
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:08,990
I'm sorry that was needed the acid

864
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:12,400
knows

865
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,200
yes useful

866
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:21,170
follows make for

867
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:25,470
ass to you your

868
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,480

869
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:35,089
to you who's been broadcasting

870

extended p by since this morning

871
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,920
problem because if you want to create a
very good demand

872
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,109
because you miss me thank you for the
consumer to communicate

873
00:57:46,109 --> 00:57:50,220
their consumption Pacific you need
electricity provided

874
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:55,440
community towards the end yes and sleep
during the day

875
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,170
broadcasting price to homes schools and

876
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,000
Lucy who said and

877
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,630
there will be able to make your decision
broadcast information

878
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,490
without making good

879
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:18,540
Venice I mean any who's really good

880
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,230
broadcasting technology system in the
nursing home

881
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:26,060
projects a good media his

882
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,099
I written statement you see it

883
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:35,480
tell you that this is completely absent
any consideration he said

884
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,270
points the first few bits and pieces
might need to do said

885
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,630
the recent MVP you decide

886
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:45,990
yes they didn't think

887
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,359
instance because you need for us
themselves

888
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:56,359
on my view mission

889
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:05,090
on

890
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:08,100
home I think the Rome

891
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:13,670
repin on said

892
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,790
those is year

there's this

894
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:25,200
is there working

895
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:29,820
which sauce

896
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:36,820
Las I'm

in I mean the Suns machine

904
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:10,730

his

910
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,400
you'd be you're using a mistake

911
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,800
is the space was not needed you wouldn't
have been so many cases

912
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,170

new medium said disingenuous you many

939
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,990
and missiles at the gym

940
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:47,310
many things you used to using

941
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:50,350
companies the smart card companies for
me like

942
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:55,900
it some sometime it's not going to be
kind to me

943
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,030
he alienated

944
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:03,570
the would them

945
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:07,490
and so many

946
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:12,330
how society should with respect to the
interactions between citizens and the

947
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,270
government

948
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:18,660
the VCU invoice who uses them

949
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:21,710
as I G talking about the movie election
day

950
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:25,630
and so why would you say the technical
requirements you need

951
