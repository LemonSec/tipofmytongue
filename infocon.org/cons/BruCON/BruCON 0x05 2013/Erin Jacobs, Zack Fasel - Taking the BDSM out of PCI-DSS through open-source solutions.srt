overall occasions we intentionally blank

31
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,800
our philosophy is always question always
challenge for america ever speaking

for it to open source license free as
this commercial solutions

41
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,909
we're going to address the house common
areas

42
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,249
that exact officials seem to be seen
most organizations against you

43
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:25,519
small businesses to is a shit

44
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,999
seeing the same for gonna talk about how

45
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,089
cleverness peace controls actually
overall security

46
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:36,469
that's something that every just changes
at 60°c ice

47
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:40,829
not security support attack day

48
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:44,499
world's to get

49
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:48,529
clients strategy said equipped with its

50
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,809
easy exit do to make your life a whole
lot easier for

51
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:54,289
site ok USA

52
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,639
sq in the modest

53
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,900
license what the stock Accies

54
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,030
not FBI accident

55
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,920
we are not going to keep asterisk feel

56
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,580
prize few examples that as much as
possible

57
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,040
want more ass was after hash TCI

58
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,280
crazy and we're not gonna say to cart

59
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,640
exchange stand that's a whole different
for thats PCI

60
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,150
split

61
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,550
yet so

62
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,660
because what you see is coming out and
saying a lot of things about

63
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,300
how to implement PCI environment so the
apartment sweet deal with

64
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,820
we can have to put this claim earthquake
%uh so

65
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,849
with all PCI your mileage may vary

66
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,790
everything is unique to your environment
and

67
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,180
what we say it may not be what your
dealings with the CIA you because your

68
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,950
assessor

69
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,980
me not understand what you're doing

70
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,410
depends on how you do it we want to put
that out there so if you have someone

71
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,160
go back to. this is what they said they
may not understand what actually works

72
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,560
also it's our opinions or guidance this
in no way store spy

73
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,700
PCI also any way shape or form or any
other QSS however

74
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,720
unlike a lot of people's lawyers
accountants

75
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,610
do you represent armenians abuse so

76
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,200
are the Palazzo supports a lot
newspapers in here

77
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,200
and we felt the need to adjust those
everywhere yes I

78
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,100
regards to being USA we do for basic
cable do endorse

79
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,790
overstating it the accents active drug
addresses that

80
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,100
your mileage will vary depending on what
USA you get with TSA

81
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,720
firm get sauce

82
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,070
2004 call only one other talkback 2008
email to us

83
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,670
they want their talkback and 2010 text
in which a natural lives it seems like

84
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,640
it would have had that

85
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,060
2004 but they wanted to talk back to you
the point at this is

86
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,680
that none of this is new but the problem
we're having is addressing that anyone's

87
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,339
talking

88
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:09,390
we're not talking about actually
solutions to ease the problems that and

89
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,400
we're seeing PCI it's not just he said
about the issue

90
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,959
yet two main challenges we have a piece
nice

91
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,620
cost and difficulty to implement and
additionally more

92
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,020
more have to comply with sky whether
it's in the states

93
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,880
Europe everywhere around has to do their
getting

94
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,900
second-hand other hand out that

95
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,530
when the case is more will find his your
people saying you have bad

96
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,760
comply by PCI well we don't and/or

97
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,089
car hood well contract says you have to
do PCR

98
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:45,520
all we see is over and over again
becoming more mister nice things for

99
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,670
large companies to use this as a
baseline

100
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,660
I don't know why and it's the hardest in
the fire but it's something that

101
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,040
you know if you're in for information
security you're gonna come across

102
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,410
whether it's for your organization
therefore what's this about or right

103
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:00,760
here

104
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,490
that is our Christian down

105
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,720
the first time deter so again what is

106
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,860
PCI currently word that PCI

107
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,990
the paper quoted made the payment card
industry data security standard

108
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,940
first to point out first person 3.0 is
coming up

109
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,800
and we have a whole lot of fun little
acts for what we wanna call

110
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,340
he said since this is not endorsed by
the PCI Council

111
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,060
we obviously cannot say thanks a lot for
this weekend have to up sell

112
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,110
against sa reminder that this is
endorsed by the Council X USS

113
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,780
fear right now just this is for you

114
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,930
so he's OK PCI

115
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:46,990
so why do we need some ice we did
because it's card

116
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,630
we it because it's a Agnes had to comply
with you know it's not just in Turlock

117
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,720
USA's

118
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,780
generally he did to you for the same
reasons

119
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,870
PCI not be ignored usually

120
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,650
it seemed OK destroyed obliterated
entire

121
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,150
heightened security budgets having with
tools utilized

122
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,300
and a lot organizations

123
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,940
very sad hat absolutely informal
experience with an experienced

124
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,840
USA USA don't have a tech competency to
actually

125
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,070
evaluated controls understand what
they're looking at

126
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,450
with their looking interacting with some
the network teams

127
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:30,800
a lot organizations so this is where the
flight was pretty quick

128
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,080
if you have any questions by all means
be an ass a free to talk a little bit

129
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,360
about

130
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,900
actual PCI very fast so let's talk about
some of us have a PCI

131
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,760
this so this all comes from the PCI
standards Council

132
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,070
PCI was free to jointly in 2004 its

133
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,720
the widely accepted party and procedures
intended optimize the security I have

134
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,580
credit debt

135
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,230
cash card transactions tech cardholder
data so

136
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,430
up I just no secret that region there by
the way

137
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,110
reflects our tickets for instance it
can't happen here very much apologize

138
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,880
there are four channel levels %uh PCI
compliance the one that we see those of

139
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,690
us little one

140
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,180
this is the level that's require you to
have it too as they come on-site

141
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,330
levels 83 84

142
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,090
fire the the essay few day

143
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,220
the self-assessment questionnaires to be
completed

144
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,850
they have a different there if you want
more information

145
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,370
our site at the available going to let
so

146
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,520
for the purposes talk about the country
to you

147
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,340
again if we actually had appearing here
we're going to find her holiday

148
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,390
the hurtful to date is your

149
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:47,010
to cart me an expiration Service Co
since the publication data

150
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,880
for max trade the CVV code participated

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,870
another the sense of occasion did
distorting

152
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,310
any given time as a comment play in just
a few moments

153
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,920
so UCI has to do it K

154
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,920
system that stores processes transmits
manages or store credit

155
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,210
connected to cardholder data impacts

156
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,700
so I couldn't text for everything and
still we're not gonna sit here and talk

157
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,390
about

158
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,540
how everything is in snow we're going to
talk about how we can try to simplify it

159
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,400
most organizations goals is to try to
limit the scope assistance

160
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,570
we try to apply this feature I'm sorry
controls

161
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:33,940
went to a PCI and obviously any
organization that goes through another

162
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,960
assessment the NTAs actually passing it
up with your

163
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,440
reported clients justice compliance
sonar x2

164
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
the disco we have a lot of things to
consider what are the most common things

165
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,790
from here we hear from a lot of vendors

166
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,850
is to basically make it somebody else's
prop outsourcing let's talk a nice it

167
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,900
was cute out our

168
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,090
fire well that's that's what she means
you have to be worked out

169
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:04,530
to completely get rid of all
responsibility once PCIe 3.0 comes out

170
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,030
what's gonna happen is that you
shouldn't be responsible to ensure that

171
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,980
whoever outsourcing its he was taking
responsibility

172
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,940
and diligence with your date so it holds
promise for into everyone's problem

173
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,360
yet again you to get up it said the
fights at

174
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,370
I was just getting comfy so

175
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,620
poets like to Austell so what i'm
talking about. open source of it why not

176
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,580
just talk about 38 for some ways to get
across

177
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,710
so with open source solutions

178
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,740
you really have a lot of flexibility
with the way it was a ploy

179
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,270
as well as obviously the biggest saving
as cost

180
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:50,150
you don't have to deal with dropping
twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year

181
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,850
on some solution

182
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,920
just to get that truck parts of and

183
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,630
really is as we're really hahaha staring
at all the pics things of commercial

184
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,070
not say there's nothing wrong with
paying someone it's a good solutions

185
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,280
but if you're smaller organization or
even if you're a larger organization who

186
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,710
has

187
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,200
really intelligent people like those of
you in this room you guys continue some

188
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,990
open source solutions that you could
come from New Year with

189
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,000
supplying the environment you have to do
with this as well as

190
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,670
only one requirement see i the cheeky
he's open source for

191
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:28,700
and that's the next yr old will be
stance with the extra home police can

192
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,740
say have to be a

193
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,260
heats can from a authorize scanning

194
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,890
fender ASP that's right

195
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:41,440
first because I was mix it up pop

196
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,460
hopefully so I can look to see if the
fights

197
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,020
greater flexibility growth with you
having the control the source code as

198
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,750
well as

199
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,950
believe our custom additions to its

200
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,790
you really can modify for your car so
that there be no rigid think

201
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,740
that doesn't work for you and you're not
locked into that a specific better

202
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
implementation

203
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,470
down the line you know when you're to
you realize that your knees and change

204
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,030
you not stopping the contract with
someone but open source

205
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,030
isn't always the right choice

206
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,890
sometimes you needed just two work
sometimes you need

207
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,040
someone you can point to and say this
isn't working and became money

208
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,500
fix it so really were pushing for

209
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,520
is more people who have the money to
spend on

210
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,560
resources intelligent people on our team

211
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,560
over buying some product and just
setting off to large corporations

212
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,160
so time and time again we see a lot of
issues with organizations trying to fear

213
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,330
PCI

214
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,200
relief there's been talk about how come
PCI compliance

215
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,910
other thing is they don't provide any
fear guy lives

216
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,640
on how to configure your farming because
and they always say

217
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,490
it past your mileage may vary your are
many different

218
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,490
and they seem really theoretically you
should implement law controls

219
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,600
yeah and it's up to you with his opinion
there's something very theoretically

220
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,110
it's another actually here's how you do
it here's how you can do this

221
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,750
and meet the requirement to go even
above and beyond

222
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,740
through security even more alone talk
about

223
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,880
premium solutions to if works free for
the first time

224
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,230
but once you got that case it's gonna
cost and they always focus on either one

225
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,160
or another operating system

226
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,450
you there is focused only on Windows
focus only on Linux

227
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,670
who focus on math I don't know but they
always focused on only one

228
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,240
operating system so we decided we want
to change this

229
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,200
we want to really believe we leavin
sharing information and knowledge been

230
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,600
really

231
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,610
growing of the resource house without
having a strong and over again

232
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,230
nothing wrong with that but sometimes
when your small organization or

233
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,260
so we decided to start something called
open PCR product

234
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,320
I documents can you of course but there
was quickly go ahead

235
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,540
so over the sky parted dot com or is
also our website

236
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,500
are are basically I come by the way we
do you know about groundout

237
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,520
worse professional services consulting
firm we go

238
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,170
selling products we only sell advice and
services so

239
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,520
we're not going to try to get him some
product we have a vested interest

240
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,850
were vendor agnostic whatsoever PCR
product back this kind of a lame to me

241
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,010
oh the problem is that although over DCI
130

242
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,320
and we could before the good one in the
meantime and I was not spending 1200

243
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,250
America

244
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,100
to get a domain K hit the market like
that

245
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,660
yeah stephen was like

246
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,130
so

247
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,970
what is our goal really what we're
trying to drive behind this the highest

248
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,800
of highs

249
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,020
open PCR product is we're looking to
come up with doctors

250
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,170
guys that a cross-platform they're
trying to pass it by ourselves our

251
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,309
clients and your organization's

252
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,400
that are scaleable that actually elevate
security not to stick to that sucks boss

253
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,030
and that actually compare it to other
solutions and maybe the market

254
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,450
of we're looking for also to put
together an are putting together

255
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,820
specific walls so and IT administrator

256
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,450
for security administrator or what you
who may not have experience in a certain

257
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,370
solution

258
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,970
will be able to take and walk through
and get something

259
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,700
up and running and maybe learn a little
bit more about it but enough to be able

260
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,190
to get yourself

261
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,120
21 level them to the next the next the
next to your knowledge

262
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,940
growing without and I want to encourage
you guys

263
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,710
that if you see anything out there we
extensively scoured the web for

264
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,900
absolutely anything reached out to
people to find out more information

265
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,980
anybody's doing any work with any type
of open source solutions

266
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,230
be worse lizard creative solutions for
addressing these issues

267
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,340
it's summer the most information we
receive we found was dated back to like

268
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,990
2010 and it was partly why I'm gonna do
this

269
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,470
party never effort me so this is one of
the big issues going back to answer to

270
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,210
the top

271
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,960
this is it new but we're not talking
about it and we're not dealing with it

272
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,880
it's something that

273
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,350
cause a lot of people pain all the time
yeah

274
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,640
one of the things that people don't
follow through with these online god's

275
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,690
lobby I'll installed work for us and I'm
gonna star

276
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,070
Cori how-to guide five years later

277
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,110
so I'm a blueberry

278
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,210
another disclaimer was the last one
slice now

279
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,820
that open PCR product Melb on the sides
of me

280
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,070
you know what we get out later with work
on housing of

281
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,210
on I'm really bad if you know for me
historically about

282
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,220
updating nice I don't know why

283
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,990
I would have really bad up to you things
or who see things in a reasonable amount

284
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,800
of time

285
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,140
but I am so we do

286
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,790
and we'll be posting more more more
space come right now it's a placeholder

287
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,500
page

288
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,510
for giving this talk also after work on
sources that someone can be uploading

289
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,120
everything

290
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,140
were trying to force is everything also
isn't that whole you should do this

291
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,610
okay how do I do this how do I you've
started

292
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,270
so we've done with the local
organizations that were really the top

293
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,280
issues BC over and over and over so
these are the

294
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,030
well high-level PCI requirements
actually slow quick

295
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,570
I'm sure pants on people have dealt with
PCR before

296
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,380
in kind of their do this not too many

297
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,970
on with your life information security
on the defensive side

298
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,760
awesome

299
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,059
all and spears thank you software
development

300
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,720
voters want to stand alone

301
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,870
awesome so the look on the top issues
that really

302
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,330
are on the top issues with its hot well
harms

303
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,300
that party on 12 my apologies entire

304
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,929
the 20 houses for PCI now we come across
out here

305
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:18,010
the ones that everyone have handled you
know they have

306
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,000
implement farrell's would know how to
implement far apart of

307
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,550
its 2013 everyone knows something morrow

308
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,450
it's not hard of your grandma has a far
on our computer we come back of

309
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,460
changing default go hunting masters by
now we know its a bad thing to the

310
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,440
default passwords and the Furious 6
protecting cardholder data using

311
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,240
encryption

312
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,080
striving little paper documents the
walnut apostol making sure you

313
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,270
delete stuff on you don't know how to do
that by now we know that's the earth

314
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,300
we know we have to do that it's breezy
most people have solved

315
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,650
well oh yes oh

316
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,010
yeah so I mean I say this not so issues
out there with them

317
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:05,429
bus we don't see it that much or see its
easily fixed something that you're able

318
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:07,669
to fix in the afternoon or a week

319
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:11,090
it's not something we like 0 we're going
to start

320
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,130
of and I had to be compliant by tomorrow
I mean actually through my security I

321
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:15,890
want to

322
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,090
but how do I do this fast encryption

323
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,580
for buchanan transit someone alqamar of

324
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,940
Antivirus is something we see a lot of
people trying to trust

325
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,179
especially if I performance farms home
you

326
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:32,390
environmental toxins in a minute address

327
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:36,669
have you have antivirus when that you
know whatever percentage

328
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:42,850
impact disch much for your business
securing systems and applications

329
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:48,200
we still suffer program I don't know how
to solve this though the TCP both

330
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,500
better no starting at the academic level
but we still suck developing secure

331
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,700
limiting access to have a passes on
things assign your YouTube it when it

332
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,880
comes to two factor authentication more
organizations while they're still

333
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,090
changing to its

334
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,690
the don't all have in place and were
they start for cost like solution

335
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:11,460
physically patrols malcolm Walker
himself long as one of the biggest ones

336
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:11,909
will touch

337
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,909
sucking penetrated housing sparing

338
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:20,380
again most people so we'll work and by
working on something they can get easily

339
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,840
fix

340
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm sorry I think ross lifestyles flows
across amounts of the type of

341
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,120
policies most of us have policies but
what about where to go

342
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,169
so while

343
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,360
to doesn't think it's the number one
problem

344
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,120
that was very quiet from what we've seen

345
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,300
its long over and over

346
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,890
over and over again people or logging

347
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,909
enough properly or spending way too much
money off

348
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:56,919
so laws laws laws laws laws laws to all
things

349
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,550
so PCR for comfort and talks a lot about
long

350
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,260
and monitoring expected and so

351
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,750
a lot of organizations have nor do you
know where to start and the easiest

352
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,429
solution is

353
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:11,720
you buy a product for that were the ones
that we love

354
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,010
mostly again you know nothing to say
their own commercial solutions for

355
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,960
squad is amazing tool leave a response
or you're too

356
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
we lost law

357
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,050
I was waiting for Vanderbilt's so

358
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,720
you must flow the thing is is a very
closely and if you're

359
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
organization although 10 15 20 people

360
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,520
you may not have 5,000 10,000 20,000 too
long which means to properly

361
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,520
a year again dojo makes these numbers

362
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,080
at this point people the room we love
you of so

363
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,710
there are solutions though to do this
and there's a lot to consider with us

364
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,919
is with logging you have to obviously
generate a loss

365
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,540
right see after how the defense to walk
home we have to

366
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,000
actually some these losses central
storage we have two

367
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,110
actually store processes law so we know
what's going on

368
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,290
monitor them to make sure that if
something is wrong route to stories the

369
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,850
hard drive you know where to go

370
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,640
if and so long so the biggest thing and
if people don't get the image

371
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,300
there's a thousand ways to skin a cat
musher that translates over here but

372
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,450
so what should we law obviously more is
better but that's not always

373
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,659
the easy solution long war means

374
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,010
more districts more process of or
licensing fees if you are going

375
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,370
were full but at a minimum PCI says

376
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,659
at a bare minimum you have to log
everyone's login system failed

377
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:43,030
any administrative actions performed by
an app

378
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,980
that it was everything not just ran a
pseudo everything as root

379
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,300
everything ran in this Windows if you're
looking for a min

380
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,309
there's a lot of things considered a
lottery since go

381
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,159
hum along with Hammond does on a windows
box

382
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,240
a work we're going to take the spot so

383
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,169
of that's one of the things why we want
to go to sponsor the so it'll say these

384
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:07,030
are the configurations you have us

385
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,750
thank you for her policies apply type

386
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,460
you also have to log in this lows in
this legislation in clearing up any loss

387
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,260
and any kind of changes to system
policies to figure respect themself

388
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,550
additionally beyond just the system was
and how to follow every change is

389
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,169
and I virus alerts intrusion detection
alerts those kind of things

390
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:35,250
so ski for one thing water here

391
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,060
a curiosity Arthur TX USA is a former
two essays in the room I know at least

392
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,399
one

393
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,870
alright II those hands did any you guys

394
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,200
have absolutely zero problems with
people finding

395
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,270
will also be had

396
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,159
RA is that says it is one of the larger
more fun

397
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,440
you know little activities for X USA
this is my butt

398
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,600
is when he said with a client and you go
to work you have the slots free

399
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,330
show me that and they sit there with us
fun Korea like

400
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:13,940
it should be there and never is

401
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,960
so worry over for for employers all
rights as a log shipping

402
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,440
my floors of here that's what you do

403
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,799
sprint phone so obviously when the other

404
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:30,240
requirements for PCI Secure altars and
replace with that also it helps the

405
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,280
students packed

406
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,820
an alert to any cover nominees we see so
when the big things how do we get these

407
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,510
losses and replace

408
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,590
how do we ship them off now for Linux
Mac network your sewer

409
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,580
is this long all things we all are
pretty firmly versus longer works great

410
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,130
if we get some of that sort of thing but
is always the best option is to use our

411
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,720
sis lock or

412
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,030
should be used agent now I'll touch on
that a second with voluntarily Marin one

413
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,940
other things we sing of solutions

414
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,260
to do you an open source file 30
mongering about that handle your lawn

415
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:00,910
collection

416
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:05,600
law according as well slow processing is
that cool tricks will talk more insight

417
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,740
as well as Windows Windows the best
blogs

418
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,340
soho of trying to take and get them

419
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,490
of into a Linux environment this whore

420
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,390
the problem is the most things ok and
all Windows Event Processing

421
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,419
so want to make things as how do we help
that now there's two different options

422
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,280
that we talk about our will close on the
site

423
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,390
as one taking having a Windows event
collector

424
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,740
having that is essential syslog course
of two you sent along this

425
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,440
or to do individual agents now of as we
said earlier

426
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,000
which ones would you do it to pass

427
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,559
he saying that but we will provide as
many options as possible

428
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:49,790
what's going to work for your
environment mansion as well as if you

429
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,400
have to

430
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,350
deployed battery monitor your other host
intrusion detection systems

431
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:57,919
kids if they want to cap city arm after
him

432
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,130
you might as well use that if you have
to deploy that father mr.

433
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,630
every system so utah real awesome

434
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,510
shipping off to the mothership what do
you do with these now

435
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,520
this one the biggest issues we see is
that people don't know what to do with

436
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,049
logs onto the hell

437
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:21,470
as well as as the biggest personal
artwork on securities laws

438
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:25,600
what processing what stores and that's
why people turn to a lot of Commerce

439
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,010
solutions so that's why we looked and
scour the net

440
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,220
long hard for some the bass open source

441
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,230
log server storage and processing
systems

442
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,000
these are the five we found that seemed
to be the best

443
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,100
most flexible most affable and reliable
that's when the big things we get more

444
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,730
from farms reliable

445
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,580
of I can process all our stay obviously
you can always just roll your own

446
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:54,150
PCI says never says you have to use
absolution

447
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,210
you can build your own using the syslog
of and running

448
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,340
work for syslog process the Los I was
sure those questions as well

449
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,760
so the earlier the five we see no the
best

450
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,160
Abu which ones right for you again means

451
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,210
but we've really seen is that these guys
over at flutie

452
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,780
have really put together a graceless now
it's harder to install started building

453
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,910
we're gonna have a how-to guide post
once while put all those things

454
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,540
but so into you axe pic what to do
themselves as the

455
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,850
open source alternative to spoil again I
lost

456
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,809
long no hard feelings but it's a great
solution to the works well

457
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:43,610
for sauce you have always always going
to central storage now you actually have

458
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,330
tomato

459
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,370
no one PCI says you have to review your
logs of

460
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,760
there's another interesting carry out
people don't realize you don't have to

461
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,730
go through email we look at every log

462
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,730
country every day you can actually have

463
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,520
automated scanning so what events you
look for what events are

464
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,890
compliant which ones are good for
secured and so that'll be the other

465
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,320
party for long cross same thing as a
show

466
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,169
of what laws you have to monitor what
event a visa window what kind of query

467
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:10,179
strings and thats

468
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:13,549
as internal saying earlier the biggest
thing we see is people going are have

469
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,100
all these law

470
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,110
what you need to demonstrate this you
know

471
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,880
so we'll be looking at what kind of
things the final nominees instead of

472
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,559
just saying

473
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,350
if 00 you should look for nominees for
too many logins

474
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:32,300
what what's on our well so with the
whole talking laws know everything so

475
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,710
see if the law is obviously

476
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,900
voluntarily Marin looking at to see if
there's an any change the system's

477
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,159
so how do you monitor for follow-up to
her

478
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,140
of again some big commercial solutions
account so we can monitor everything

479
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,300
here right now

480
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,530
what we found is that

481
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:54,020
there's actually five of one of your
apologize

482
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,130
eyes it's operating system system
specific

483
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,130
every five great open source solutions
to do this

484
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:03,640
30 reminder deploy an attractive for

485
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,240
found every month with all these the
best solution that we found is to take

486
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,490
on some issues central syslog for my
ringer

487
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:14,629
processing in one that you can come
together

488
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:18,950
now the interesting thing is our
favorite so far has been OS of

489
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,070
company will have heard of course I how
many people love it

490
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,179
about a quarter of the bank's

491
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,639
out she we actually love we think it's a
great thing to be able to have

492
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,240
it to you initial processing logs act as
a collector for you as well

493
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,220
and also Maher volatility chains yes
it's a little more difficult to

494
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,530
configure versus a

495
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,740
open source just walk to acquire or
growing your own

496
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,179
of up he said so far it's interesting
this is where we want to come up with

497
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:52,350
and have a place where people could
discuss unique ways to address the work

498
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:52,970
permits

499
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,080
PCF requirements a you need to at least
check weekly

500
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,869
to see there's great house there's
nothing that says you have to check

501
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:04,030
every second or live stream or anything
like that

502
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,930
its weekly so when the next %ah
situations we've seen is what people

503
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,760
have taken an

504
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,970
if remotely access the file sir ran a
half stack a quick mp5 checking all

505
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:16,320
files exist

506
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,700
up /a to follow up /a to follow up this
because their differences

507
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,740
yep tonight or

508
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,600
so there's unique ways we could take an
address this using homegrown or open

509
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,920
source solutions

510
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,220
is set up having to just buy of the
product think

511
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:36,030
now granted monitoring our lives better
security solution

512
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,930
we can meet that check box as well by
doing something internally

513
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:45,890
patch management is the hardest fucking
thing

514
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,540
part might do to us the hardest thing

515
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,640
to address a open source right now

516
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,040
there are not really and the greats
cross-platform

517
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,740
open source man 31 to know what I love
to hear about

518
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:06,140
anyone

519
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,470
seven public disgrace box the promises
more folks wrote the creation management

520
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,339
though is it

521
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:19,070
your trip it doesn't look in many ways

522
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,180
but not simply walk Singapore window
systems

523
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:29,180
this ok

524
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,290
yeah

525
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,670
we see lucky loser for the link survive
in such a compartment when it comes to

526
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,740
open source past never

527
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,950
I'll to great solutions combine together
prime use them always together

528
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,360
of a man certifications most
appointments updates

529
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,440
so 7 pop it is we're actually polemics
take

530
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,760
was where I was touching on that so back
to our story though with the open source

531
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,200
that is what has to pass a 10 X amount
of

532
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,840
and this is why it's so hard with PCI
you have to pass not just the operating

533
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,400
system

534
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,530
but any third party applications as well

535
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:06,160
so 1x

536
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,480
obviously this breezy stick to the stuff
in the rebound of

537
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,160
you can but Windows is where things get
difficult

538
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,670
I'll like a so we we had a hard time
finding something else cost $5 for their

539
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,240
work

540
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,050
and just work in the alarm especially as
well inventorying what's offers actually

541
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,920
install

542
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,200
this is where we were talking a lot
about what we want this to be in so

543
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,270
focused on where you could spend to
resources obviously only have so much

544
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,700
money

545
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,040
its ban if you work with an organization
this may be some work to go

546
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
art the commercial solutions do better
here

547
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,250
hospital money here first my longing
sigh work and save some money

548
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,390
so on so forth booked our solutions with
Windows like I was saying if

549
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,000
use WSUS is not open source with built
into Windows

550
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,890
as an open source to tool called the
package which will actually do third

551
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,970
party packages

552
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:57,700
easier with the US west and turn affect
the outcome namely

553
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,000
of math ice owner to the world

554
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,630
do if they're found itself in public
health you know and be able to do it to

555
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,510
their

556
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,170
but again this is we're also

557
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,560
building a homegrown drop home-grown
situation or a solution

558
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,060
would help it's something they really
more

559
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,350
development and that's one of the things
we want to take in hell

560
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,690
build up the security as well not just

561
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,869
clients and so work Bazaar call for help
so if anyone knows anything

562
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:35,730
we want to hear from you as well you if
you're bored and wanna start developing

563
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,990
a cross-platform

564
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,100
of past as a solution that's reliable
scalable

565
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,150
there's a summer winter fall

566
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,040
23 years online product for and I'll
keep you busy

567
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,960
and drinking of I two factor
authentication is also who see a lot of

568
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,920
people

569
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,180
get caught up I'll so with the level of
PCR

570
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,380
is that you need to have two factors 03

571
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,650
something you know which is a pass for

572
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,000
something you have such is a token

573
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,070
certificate laptop a cow and something
you are

574
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:17,010
biometrics we haven't seen people use
the biometrics I when it comes to long

575
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,290
your mouth

576
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,260
we have seen mostly as a something you
know something you have and those are

577
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,810
really the open source world of

578
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,420
the two things that you use most so
everything to something you know

579
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,710
passwords when use them to the second
factor the something your house

580
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,590
now that the summer losses only use take
place

581
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:38,160
one is remote connections to the

582
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,310
car living environment so

583
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,880
if you can't remote connect into their
you don't need it

584
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,910
but I don't want to miss their mark

585
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,180
it still exists so putting some kind of

586
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,700
jump box VPN solution remote desktop in
between

587
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,530
there in the car or the environment pubs
get back so

588
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,570
easiest if it's obviously for me PCI
perspective good

589
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:10,290
from a security perspective these with a
lecture about security advocate

590
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,530
implications a if you compromise machine
getting the certificate be able to

591
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,350
extract back

592
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,320
but up which the check box we will go
above and beyond

593
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,310
of so looking for solutions out there
there's not really any SMS please what

594
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,500
we see a lot of commercial companies
doing it but

595
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,660
of we've actually done for salsa we
brought our of

596
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,260
using open are open but using are based
a lot for the services such as

597
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,550
really ok leave 0 overcome the pic was
the market right now

598
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,150
you can connect to them and just
basically say SMS this phone

599
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,590
with this code and use that build your
own work well for us for our SCH

600
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,510
management for many larger boxes

601
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,640
and housework the one-time thing home to
be with your family with a laugh

602
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,020
oo ay very few so or as the

603
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,080
open oh my gosh you need in sorrow that
open authentication

604
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,550
know what's missing awesome of

605
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,980
I forget so is all that is the open
authentication product where basically

606
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,260
the focusing on creating

607
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,280
and opened two factor authentication
using its max

608
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,740
ashes and trunking so of

609
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,930
its open standard which works for its
not its proprietary

610
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,970
big 3 will accompany me all calm out

611
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,020
of bud a lot of them take it from
someone fighters tough words or

612
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,470
focus on an open standard we love it of
to some hardware that you to purchase or

613
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,050
you can also take a dude oversaw

614
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,100
r us offer solutions Google
authenticator for those who use that

615
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,090
walking again your phone it's alright

616
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:45,490
what's great about it as you can role
additional defines including

617
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:50,450
your John boxes replay and six other of
with having set of medicare

618
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,609
and that's what comes into question
marks the central clinic in north

619
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:58,980
do you do radio space because some
fuckin pissed

620
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,760
spinning the server solutions for that

621
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,810
varies based on the business case again
will be on the site

622
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,859
with the different guys for the
different use overseas and you keys open

623
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,250
source on the job one

624
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,520
of depends on your

625
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,280
anyone more water break +91 talk about
in our support for

626
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,380
K that's alright antivirus works for me

627
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,570
it's not dead sick SeaTac

628
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:30,550
that's the only joking today for what
gets hit by arson attack

629
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,260
so yeah endeavors is a huge struggle
with PCI

630
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,420
because there's so many environments I
mean people are reading me

631
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,630
frames the running custom bills Linux
kernels

632
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,690
and the question is so why

633
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,560
in it not only quiet antivirus on it its
can actually

634
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,950
if he'd that up

635
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,780
where to are today up thank you

636
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,130
has appeared as a frankly the
performance the systems and

637
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,190
a lot of the times we've worked with I
mean they're very large-scale clients

638
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,160
and performance

639
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,910
services lifeblood so the idea actually
putting a table then entire scientists

640
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:12,870
just frightens them snow and so what
we've done and nothing intentional

641
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,780
slight type of its highest

642
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,060
is to you know PCI has this

643
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,750
this really cool statement about it it
just put on here is

644
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,980
that deploy antivirus software

645
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,140
on all systems commonly affected by
malicious software

646
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,200
sup that's a free pretty huge

647
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,770
gap in how you interpret that so I don't
know that your custom role Linux kernel

648
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:42,410
and the box and after you running on top
but that only your organization's

649
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,270
ever seen before is going to come effect
but now we're

650
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,730
latest argument where I understand so
this is

651
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,370
come away terminally

652
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,800
so some other solutions a week we've
seen is that

653
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,740
thank you said checking for rogue
processes it's more for anomaly

654
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,520
detection

655
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,480
on those boxes the most people that are
building the stock symbol in the system

656
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,720
understand what their systems normal

657
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,810
operating your standards look like they
understand the processes that are

658
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:13,440
supposed to be

659
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,619
running exactly how they're supposed to
be running

660
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:20,250
one of the great solutions that we've
seen to is that if there's something

661
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,770
wrong especially in these large-scale

662
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,040
fireman's is the boxes it's free

663
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,140
rebooted it next week recovery whites
you know

664
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:32,080
you could become south Fort its
completely clean and start all over

665
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,720
again

666
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,540
me that tends to work

667
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,310
you want to take back over if things to
add

668
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:44,119
I apologize my throws with really dry
for the past week so I hope a

669
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:44,910
mechanistic

670
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,570
here so

671
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:52,740
yeah okay at

672
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,690
here let me pass the mic around so

673
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,880
again and the other things and mrs.
doesn't need to peace traditionally

674
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,170
center-based

675
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,670
using a application whitelisting whether
it's both both in the Windows

676
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,900
or as he lay next to me I configure it

677
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,900
or ap armor sometimes me so choir again
this is where the whole PCI

678
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,420
USA it depends always plays in the place

679
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,890
well as option for you to explore as an
open source solution for when you need

680
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,600
to take

681
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,890
addresses antivirus requirements where
we can do what I want doesn't just saw a

682
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,800
public land a call today

683
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,080
so vote from the big top

684
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,880
issues we see over and over with PCI the
commuters by open source solutions

685
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,000
that don't always needed to have

686
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,810
a vendor product not to say again than
the promise a bad

687
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,210
but so when you go back to you of your
organization you

688
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,940
your client organizations or someone you
reasonable in the future friend who may

689
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,359
be like hey do you how do I handle this

690
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,410
you have some ideas as well as I said a
lot more will be developing on the whole

691
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,050
open PCR product site

692
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:09,000
will have a way for were discussed how
to say hey I did this this work out well

693
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,380
what do you guys think slash man's
ability slashed all the earth

694
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,589
himself so of that's come the big issues
you're over however there are a few

695
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:21,830
random PCI fun

696
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,940
if she's we see arm

697
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,420
and yes I got lazy and just through
these all the ones life

698
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,680
let's go have a 3m so

699
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,620
one of the things we see is you know P
several fire assay not share passwords

700
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,170
can't be used across users that means

701
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,780
you cannot have a shared administrator
password on multiple machines

702
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,880
however UCI says you can have the
service account with the share passwords

703
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,990
as long as it's not a certain Hall Pass
ore again

704
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,630
party secure several more about we see
solutions for this because everyone gets

705
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,930
being done this is that they are like
I'm not gonna look elaborate house all

706
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,230
these machines are enough

707
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,770
want them she goes offline I can't trust
looking to radius for Active Directory

708
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:07,160
or whatever

709
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,250
are you log in the boxes my IT guys have
to be able to fix it

710
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,670
of turns out that's what chooses not to
go haha

711
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,460
your compliance I have a final comment
auditor I gotta find me

712
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:24,069
yes my boss is gonna giving assessors
sorry

713
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:27,430
assessor the storm ok USA

714
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,950
yet so eisin

715
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,190
I just I just took a test I'll yeah
it'll be fun

716
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,510
so wanting to see a lot of people is
that

717
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,080
they've either dont want two things 1 is
it a can use

718
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,290
either an humble open I'm not kidding
you if

719
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,790
putting the having one and then right
the password output in

720
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,540
on for the Kwahu in the feel it and put
in the safe

721
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:56,980
and something needed a go and get I
think you know they've changed passwords

722
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,560
a and didn't you

723
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,780
little currency is all these if a small
and you like really I have to do this to

724
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,160
be compliant nice

725
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,510
talk use a swerve recommended this is
Mike this is what we're recommending now

726
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,430
like

727
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,319
right to pass without a clue to see from
only one guy can know this

728
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:19,089
well there are things you see that works
well though the Wii for me personally

729
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:22,420
is a doing this unique local admin
accounts and using solutions change all

730
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,390
the passwords

731
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,780
is %uh come who are familiar with Yuko
you the keys

732
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,470
the crew call um as much as an open
source this is a game like

733
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,810
the fun got just they could do single
password so you have someone broke into

734
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:39,030
the house were there for the one-time
price

735
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:41,680
technically skilled why cuz you don't
know the password when you push the

736
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,190
keystroke to do it

737
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,530
cuz Yuki's and you just not to factor
but also store passos well

738
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,030
of so something interesting we can to
put in there is a little

739
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,310
got so that we want it's taken through
other I

740
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,500
do I get the worst

741
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,760
given you a break so some of the other
fun ones in

742
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,560
we've all seen by track changes on the
sieving 3 a.m. Zack

743
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,990
that change control and all that good
stuff other role that's one final thing

744
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:10,240
in the reviews

745
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,970
so I V change control we all know what
it is we all know how annoying it is in

746
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:14,410
some

747
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,740
certain applications developers a
generally a lot better at doing it then

748
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:22,650
normal system admins as just a normal
Top Chef one or the other items that we

749
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,250
have an added it up here yet

750
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,280
as far as the solution there are a few
really cool

751
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,310
officer solutions that are coming out
that do change control if you're at a

752
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:33,640
small organization small to mid-size
which is nice

753
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,280
because you don't need issues management
systems and again

754
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,310
you control your own one other items I
wanted addressed out rolling around

755
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:45,190
having on resources in this room I just
feel the intelligence

756
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:50,040
overwhelmed but we all know that we
probably all go back to work with people

757
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,480
that might be a little less intelligence

758
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,560
than we are or have to sleep on our team

759
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,069
this is one of the reasons and drivers
why we wanted to do this the first place

760
00:49:59,069 --> 00:50:01,020
is because we wanted to allow

761
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,620
people to have the budget to look
actually get good

762
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,980
technical resources now roll-your-own
isn't always

763
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,220
reasonable its role in your own means
that technical resources can be doing

764
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,250
nothing but coding this for forgetting

765
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,150
two months that helps nobody so again

766
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:21,020
your mileage will vary but you know
apply the resources where they can thus

767
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,700
why things that this

768
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,850
intended to do one the other items that
we all I claims that this is the

769
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:27,720
segregation

770
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,560
roles in large organizations segregation
rose a little bit easier but when you

771
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,450
start talking

772
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,069
mid-size organizations and small
businesses that have to comply with PCI

773
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:39,089
I mean it's a nightmare

774
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:43,020
it's Ivan realistic half the time so
getting really created is on the things

775
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,040
that we

776
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,550
we work on doing the work on educating
we work with a lot of other to say is

777
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,130
that

778
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:51,690
have nothing to do with us to
collaborate and understand

779
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,640
good solutions for being able to do that
segmentation

780
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,109
and again I am just was himself in the
head with the one primary function per

781
00:51:02,109 --> 00:51:02,760
system

782
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,970
again in enterprise environments and
viruses are scaled

783
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,430
built for these applications it's fine

784
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,350
but we're talking again small businesses
for midsize businesses that

785
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:18,359
are just they're struggling to actually
keep their Scopus small as they can

786
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:23,530
but yet yup they don't have the money
for a lot of hardware so try to get very

787
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:29,220
very creative with that a lot and it's
not always applicable

788
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,520
the managing I've trip to he is at no
one's doing this while

789
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,589
I am seriously you guys think if you can
honestly admit that you're

790
00:51:37,589 --> 00:51:41,880
your company is managing here your keys
extremely well

791
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,230
a special US is ok he is still have
recently and I

792
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,420
yeah me me me

793
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:54,140
that's a bold statement

794
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,819
okay a few we go on the record for that

795
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:00,900
okay in you actually York

796
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,250
you might have the only fighting chance
I believe till

797
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,690
mate up to 10 no I won't pass

798
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,370
a certain company no of know it's a
little bit things we've seen

799
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:16,280
is that up putting yes ok East actively

800
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,430
to get this love think USA logo got job
is that

801
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:23,970
I'll you have to protecting the SL key
because as the data in transit

802
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:27,220
now granted your site for of dummy .to

803
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,790
the you're probably doing your credit
card processing if you do you next

804
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:35,380
early you not just phone but no online
commerce stuff we've seen a lot of

805
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,520
is people will take a nap protect that
he either just got 0

806
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,380
both the server reboots and he's built
on lock yes okay that's fine right

807
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:46,589
its nope as well as you know technically

808
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:50,589
PCI says that one person can have not a
key or its whole thing so you actually

809
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:51,990
have to control the keys

810
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,020
of encryption %uh that's another fun one

811
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,060
as another word you know like I said
Yuki is not a

812
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,680
and/or solution but it works great for
having store pass on me like poop okay

813
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,200
to

814
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,910
of I I think we're almost out on those
as well as I wrap it up

815
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:13,260
I just wanted to get in the last the
last question and answer

816
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:18,130
so again and in kind of summarizing what
we've we've gone through

817
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:21,319
I he brought it up so yes

818
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:25,910
again we are not here to SA who be more
than happy to do question answers but

819
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,790
please don't be offended if a certain
items that were not to be able to talk

820
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,880
about since can be recorded session

821
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,980
we were no problem that certain USA's
might be at the bar later

822
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,880
by it in the words of the great Mike
Donahue train for

823
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,549
who train a lot X USA's his his
signature answer to everything is

824
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:49,290
it patents so again your mileage may
vary without your to SA

825
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,220
sack was talk to you again asserts last
thing I have four questions

826
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,330
um but again like that you know with the
big thing you want to question the thing

827
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,839
we want to push it is open PCR project
is that there's

828
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,990
open source solutions that we can start
realizing its community for clients for

829
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,270
environments

830
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,420
that we can start using a custom Isaac a
lot more to not just improve our

831
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,589
compliance but less popular than the
other

832
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:15,549
through the security as well and use
obviously since PCI

833
00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:19,580
is a driver for a lot of businesses we
can use that to kill resource

834
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,279
little time to start saying hey I wanna
work on this you know it's for PCI right

835
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:25,660
now we got this big thing a bill to it

836
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,839
so using that as a driving force taken
actually through the security

837
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:32,770
using is gonna open source solutions to
go about me a call of

838
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,000
and it's not just us if you guys wanna
help our had time to help out there

839
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,700
he said Hi Tec by all means please reach
out to us P need as much help as

840
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,600
possible for the community a

841
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:48,600
needs one more day and our audience
questions

842
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:56,100
so if you have a roomie Mike

843
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,980
sir talks a lot

844
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,690
ISO to requests yes the first known as

845
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,180
if you're online system inadvertently
loves world

846
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,299
days it was it that because with
disabilities yes

847
00:55:14,299 --> 00:55:18,250
which then leads me to my second bus if
talks love it

848
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,220
roles in bus to convert or I'd love to
hear a bit more about

849
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:25,779
companies succeed or fail based on the
game horse

850
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:30,240
still ok what is it what is not
installed which is a lot to go through

851
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,660
this is painful

852
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:36,260
and talk more about ice yet so I'll talk
right now

853
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:40,230
her first catalogue of so PCI

854
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,990
yea it actually has a requirement there
for checking to see if there's

855
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:48,089
car ordered a historic walls and Walker
cardholder data stored in there

856
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:53,690
now it allows you to technically have
car other data for debugging purposes

857
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,180
including authentication data 4

858
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:02,400
authorization as all securities but know
this is last those canisters into

859
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,029
commerce Co

860
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:06,730
and that's where you know we talk about
store bosses transmits

861
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,079
directly connected to an manages so also
that long system

862
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:15,309
or say the other system that manages
long systems targeting Carlo they have

863
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:16,099
been sent to it

864
00:56:16,099 --> 00:56:22,309
it with an be under scope and this is
something I i feel that i could say

865
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:23,529
openly and

866
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:26,640
dis is my piece of advice from being an
internal

867
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,549
work internally getting its ass is that
one thing a lot organizations don't

868
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:34,250
think I'm doing and this is up on any to
change your environment as well

869
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,470
if you are working with the QSAR USAC
company

870
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,470
ask them to do a limit its go only
assessment of your company if you can if

871
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,200
you have the bandits be able to do that

872
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,920
so havoc USA comment an address what
your scope actually is before you're in

873
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,730
the process of

874
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,220
rock assessment and that you're sitting
there for three days you know just

875
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,559
fighting over

876
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,690
what where the boundaries are pure skill
that

877
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,940
as we all know scoped out to be a huge
challenge and if you don't believe the

878
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,250
back to SA is my ass for another opinion

879
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,380
and I don't like endorsing it because
you we both come from aqsa company

880
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,440
but you know my prayer life I know
profit-taking assessor of

881
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,369
our site you know if I didn't believe
what they're saying I now that's only if

882
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:18,039
I thought they were not competent not
just because they were talking but i

883
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:18,770
wanna be here

884
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:22,779
so says your question yet

885
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:29,779
excellent and other questions
