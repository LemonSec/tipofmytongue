1
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:08,138
all right thank you thank you for the

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,400
invitation everyone had a good lunch now

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:12,459
hopefully I've got to try keep you awake

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,129
for the next few hours but I do I am

5
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:16,480
told there are bears later on and if all

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,310
else fails I got an extra beer at the

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
front here free run so my name is

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,140
Controlman chief security officer for

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,650
the cloud nai groups with inside

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,650
Microsoft

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,130
yeah Microsoft's a very big company

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,300
basically what the areas that I'm

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,440
responsible for are looking at the next

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,659
year plus of security technologies that

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,789
we're going to build and apply and the

16
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:48,960
longer term vision for Microsoft on the

17
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:52,030
security front and so to talk about well

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,829
topics and I thought most have probably

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,139
for the intro for the team here or for

20
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:58,569
the group here it was really about

21
00:00:55,139 --> 00:01:01,059
looking at how seam has changed so

22
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:04,390
security incident response incident and

23
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:06,880
event management how it's changed and

24
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:12,130
where it's going next the reason for the

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,479
change is that well I think you if you

26
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,520
be watching the news fairly recently you

27
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,649
would have seen an awful lot about cloud

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,810
seam and a cloud native seen both in

29
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:24,189
particular from Microsoft with Azure

30
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:27,609
Sentinel and Google with their Chronicle

31
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:31,298
solutions and so these are all cloud

32
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:33,788
based but more poorly AI based so when I

33
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,039
started looking at doing Incident

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:40,140
Response in event management a long time

35
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:43,060
ago how many of you you know had have

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,939
begun their sort of security security

37
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,979
careers about 20 years 20 years ago

38
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,770
looking at things like does anyone

39
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:54,340
remember site protector Internet

40
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:57,158
Security site protector none okay well

41
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,640
that's right so over the years the

42
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,189
technology required to analyze threats

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:09,110
to

44
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:11,060
to investigate compromises and perform

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,730
response has changed fundamentally

46
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,560
during that time so 20 years ago if

47
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,799
you're appalled analysts effectively you

48
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,269
had tree type dialogues to start

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,739
navigating and trying to find out what

50
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,160
was a big red light and what it actually

51
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,900
meant that's already well and so a

52
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,609
couple of years later the first

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,110
generation of scene technologies came

54
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,230
out we're effectively take all of those

55
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,630
logs from all of your typically your

56
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,130
network defenses load means one place

57
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,480
and then scroll through those logs right

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,430
that didn't really work too well

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,959
you know and so if you're a good analyst

60
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,269
you would have just furtively if you

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,310
know give me the command line and write

62
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,440
scripts to investigate and hunt through

63
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,379
your scene technology to find those

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,019
particular threats that was okay until

65
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:59,599
the volume of data started increasing

66
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:01,790
dramatically right and then we started

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,869
to move on so if I start think in my

68
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,328
career about 2006 throughout 2012 watch

69
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,230
its technology then switched from seam

70
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:15,290
and command line to Hadoop clusters you

71
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,750
know so using Hadoop and and no sequel

72
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:19,578
type engines to be able to group and

73
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,079
cluster types of events together and

74
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:25,280
then start analyzing and looking for

75
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,540
threats and that was good except that

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,849
you know you have to be a bit of a data

77
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,220
scientist and more importantly you

78
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,858
probably had to have you know if you've

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,180
ever built Hadoop clusters and try to

80
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,609
manage them you've probably spent about

81
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,739
90% your time just trying to you know

82
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,540
manage the Hadoop cluster is about Tim

83
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:44,569
and 10 % neat i'm actually trying to get

84
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,980
data out of their systems and so

85
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:48,730
technology changed move on the server

86
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,018
and so really today much of the

87
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:57,078
technology you'll find for looking at

88
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:59,930
security events and security logs is

89
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,410
really graph based technologies so in

90
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,019
particular AI based graphing and log

91
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,239
analytics time systems so that's been

92
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,430
the 20-year journey I think that the

93
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,620
part where we are today is this thing

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,849
called cloud seam yeah and you know

95
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,319
wherever you pick up the press today you

96
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,180
will

97
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,668
and lots and lots of notations about

98
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,858
this whole thing about cloud seam I

99
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:24,008
wanna step back a little bit on that and

100
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,120
and that is there was a different type

101
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:28,030
of seam on what that actually said

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,699
already means right so if you like today

103
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:33,400
there are three classes of seam and they

104
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:34,900
get cold cloud in various ways so you've

105
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,539
got your on-premises seam

106
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,979
okay so effectively this is my wrecked

107
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,800
hardware

108
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,919
it's basically sliced by the largest

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,440
load I think I'm going to analyze and it

110
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,409
will have local salt connector so local

111
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,750
controls and connectors for sending new

112
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:57,900
commands to say BitDefender or to your

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,130
Cisco reality Cisco routers or firewalls

114
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,130
the bottleneck for that type of seam has

115
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,080
always been data retention so many of

116
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,580
the co-operators took their yeah over

117
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,840
the last three or four years took their

118
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,909
on premises you know ten wraps solutions

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,169
and we effectively put them onto virtual

120
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,229
machines and then loaded them up into

121
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,719
the clouds okay so at that point you

122
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,258
have infrastructure as a service type

123
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,180
hosting of seam with a pairs interface

124
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,330
so you know a nice little web interface

125
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,620
for controlling that is that's right you

126
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,979
get a little bit of cloud scaling

127
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,020
effects normally from rapid scaling

128
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:36,820
across horizontally from a data

129
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,830
structure side but many ways you can

130
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,599
sort of think of you know that first

131
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,940
generation or that that stepping stone

132
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:46,360
of generation of trailed seam was really

133
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,650
sort of a managed type of service the

134
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,720
biggest bottleneck with that type of

135
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,239
approach has really been the I as

136
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,949
pricing so by moving from on premises of

137
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,270
the cloud you're not really making use

138
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:56,919
of anything that anything from the cloud

139
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,109
side you were favorably using the cloud

140
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,859
is you know a next to no external

141
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:05,139
hosting provider cloud seemed

142
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,880
particularly becomes cloud native it

143
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:08,349
starts changing the way that we look at

144
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,110
these things so we moved to a layered

145
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:13,539
SAS model and more often to a service

146
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,490
like of architecture so hyper scalable

147
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,979
and or no dimensions

148
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,440
importantly when you look at the you

149
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:23,650
know the solutions in this area is now

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,810
AI enables and it's AI by defaults

151
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,190
and more importantly I think here when

152
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,020
we look at the seams technologies are

153
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,570
changing especially now

154
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,490
DevOps compliant is mandatory right and

155
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,969
so the DevOps cycle is now built into

156
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,840
the cloud seem the bottleneck

157
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,280
interesting and I'll cover this in

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,070
question so detail really is the

159
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,359
bottleneck lies and the labeling process

160
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,070
so what that really means is that I've

161
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,540
got all this data I'll always have all

162
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,130
this data I'm very good at hunting

163
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,210
through the data the machines are even

164
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,280
better at finding things through the

165
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,530
data it's just that the machines find

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,448
things that have no labels and requires

167
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,789
an expert to understand and then decide

168
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:03,520
on how to respond to things that the the

169
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:06,159
cloud throws up one of the big trends

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,190
right my season one I think for most

171
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,690
people understand when it comes to

172
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,410
security information technology's really

173
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,630
is the state of trend of this for like

174
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,229
this hockey stick approach to data and

175
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:22,090
data volume so today if you look at that

176
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,159
volume of data I sort of break it down

177
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,710
into a number of areas so if it's

178
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,690
visible is this the volume of data is

179
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,840
increasing doubling tripling you know

180
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,639
every week in some instances so what

181
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,000
constitutes that security data so we're

182
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,550
talking about alerts events and logs

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,160
also engage us with the telemetry right

184
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:46,330
flows from the network devices threat

185
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,710
intelligence TTP's and detonations their

186
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,330
Nations is not familiar with that or is

187
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,849
effectively you know a lot a lot more

188
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,750
work has gone on taking a malicious link

189
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:57,849
malicious URL or a suspicious file and

190
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,710
then opening it and in a controlled

191
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:03,310
environments watching what happens in

192
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,330
extracting those behaviors and so over

193
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,220
that time while those sort of

194
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,620
technologies have changed and we've it

195
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,849
add more technologies to their space the

196
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,020
role and the use of steam has changed so

197
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,729
you know if your organization really

198
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,049
started with a steam technology and

199
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,729
you're a large organization you probably

200
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,410
walked up to the stage you have the seam

201
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:21,940
of seams because an individual seam

202
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:24,190
couldn't handle this type of data going

203
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,039
forward now the rest of the cloud native

204
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,680
seam is the only ready area that we can

205
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,970
start dealing with the true huge volumes

206
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,970
of data that we have to deal with

207
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:40,789
under the cover and so you know this one

208
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:43,010
here is a you know the background and

209
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,959
like as your Sentinel from a cloud seam

210
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,910
but it'll be the same type of approach

211
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,070
for anyone that sort of close goes well

212
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,130
native so fending me from left and right

213
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:56,030
you have the data collection so that

214
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,230
they logs the custom maps and the

215
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,150
information that's being passed through

216
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,760
there right so go through a passing

217
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,010
engine and at an ingestion stage

218
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,050
there'll be a number of connectors so

219
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,550
for example where the syslog and other

220
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,680
types of connectors the vendors

221
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,449
themselves of those devices will make

222
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,219
their own connectors there'll be network

223
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,870
connectors and there will be custom data

224
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,730
connectors for your own organizations

225
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,370
and your own applications that you sort

226
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,110
of built the next stage if I have those

227
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,740
connectors is effectively normalization

228
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,900
so how do I convert all these different

229
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,630
let's say I have three different vendors

230
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,310
for vulnerability scanning right and

231
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,790
they all call us you know they all call

232
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,900
and I cross-site scripting vulnerability

233
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,760
have slightly different names and

234
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,290
different sort of descriptions I need to

235
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,730
normalize those to bring them down into

236
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,469
one description and to be able

237
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,310
understand and track that from a mapping

238
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,850
perspective if I had to look at all the

239
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,890
areas of security and where we are today

240
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,440
and particularly from a sim technology I

241
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,069
think that that normalization phase is

242
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,230
one of the areas that all probably would

243
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:02,180
I would like to get rid of as fast as

244
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,170
possible you know the normalization

245
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,349
phase loses a lot of data and a lot of

246
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,540
new intelligence their way so once it

247
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,980
belies that data we then move on to so

248
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,449
if you like the storage and so today's

249
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,160
storage really can break them down to

250
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,900
three classes of storage so log

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,969
analytics so effectively have I tackle

252
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,699
those logs and story in this searchable

253
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,710
database blob storage so all the f of

254
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,080
mation that can't be you know stored in

255
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,780
individual logs or individual analytics

256
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,950
and then a graph DB so taking some of

257
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,870
these the metadata some of the

258
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,620
highlights and being able to use that as

259
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,590
a mapping between intelligent clusters

260
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:42,320
after that yeah the next area of cloud

261
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,390
native AI really is about how to build

262
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,939
and train the models for detection and

263
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:47,439
classification

264
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:50,049
and we'll cover that in normal detail

265
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:52,629
after I've got these sort of you know

266
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:55,179
machine learning models or AI models

267
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:56,259
then I can move on to enrichments okay

268
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,228
so they'll be taking and threat

269
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:01,629
intelligence living analyst blow up

270
00:10:59,229 --> 00:11:03,909
their own bookmarks and building up

271
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:07,029
their own data sets and query science

272
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:09,129
and security graphing okay so be able to

273
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:11,139
take that threat hunting experience

274
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:14,769
through graph and convert that back into

275
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:16,539
a replayable playbook for example and

276
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,389
then the last stage really serve and

277
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,069
visualize so the UX which is always

278
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:22,899
great fun to sort of play around with

279
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:25,089
better though on the day-to-day side and

280
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:27,699
from the sock operations really moving

281
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:31,209
into the search and sort of detection

282
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:34,598
type technologies so if that's the sort

283
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:37,508
of if you like the core chunks of steam

284
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:42,220
technology how do these think will play

285
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:45,309
out okay so when I look at where is the

286
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:48,159
cutting edge today for seem in

287
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,799
particular the threat hunting experience

288
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,599
and if you like how these things aren't

289
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,699
going to evolve I think it's a good idea

290
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:56,259
to take a snapshot of where they're you

291
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,108
know if we're the state of the artist

292
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,519
today so first of all should be without

293
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:04,349
any argument the state of the art is

294
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:08,829
cloud native okay the big thing here is

295
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:10,779
all the data all the time okay and it's

296
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,758
really hard to understand or to stress

297
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,939
how important that is and how we go

298
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,739
change that is so traditionally if you

299
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:20,019
want by the number of hard drives they

300
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:22,629
had and at the speed of access then

301
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:24,939
maybe I could you know analyze their

302
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,429
threat hunts and retrospectively threat

303
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:30,309
hunt through say ninety days 180 days

304
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:32,769
okay if you've been following things

305
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:35,589
like the Verizon reports threat reports

306
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:37,659
or the IBM reports or I don't know you

307
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,149
name the next 53 reports that sort of

308
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:42,579
come out every month or every quarter or

309
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:45,519
every half year what you'll find is that

310
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:47,469
probably the average time to detection

311
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,369
of a compromised is somewhere between

312
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:54,630
about 190 to 200 days so that's the

313
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:56,280
average right

314
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:58,230
that means said of your seemed really

315
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,680
needs to have probably about three years

316
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,710
maybe five years of data stored in it

317
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,839
for you to be able to sue look for

318
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:10,920
threats hunt for threats investigate

319
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,570
threats and draw out some instant

320
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,380
response plans against and to manage

321
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,180
against them Devaki piece about being

322
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,920
cloud native obviously being hyper

323
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,689
scalable but also the cloud automation

324
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,849
okay so when when I look at cloud seam

325
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,800
what I also focus on what my mind on is

326
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,190
all of the workloads that are also in

327
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,069
the clouds okay and this is a new area

328
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:37,110
really of as organizations move from

329
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,750
on-premise and have a mix of different

330
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,220
you know I think the on-premise security

331
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,740
environment has about a hundred and

332
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,750
seventy different types one hundred and

333
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,520
seventy classes of technology and about

334
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,070
seventy different vendors on average

335
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,120
okay what time you move to the clouds

336
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:57,330
and running advanced workloads you down

337
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,730
to about ten to twelve vendors and about

338
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,020
seventy technologies but those

339
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,350
technologies can be heavily weighted

340
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,420
towards the cloud provider as part of

341
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,190
that package though the cloud providers

342
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,579
also providing all the automation that

343
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:15,210
surrounds them the next big piece really

344
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,990
is visual investigation ok so moving on

345
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,390
from simple queries and entity matching

346
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,030
to now be able to traverse between

347
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:26,550
entities such as users assets apps and

348
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:30,750
URLs but also now between activities

349
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,760
okay so logins transfers usage or the

350
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,020
telemetry all these statistics about

351
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,130
connections and work places they go

352
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,569
forward and more importantly what we're

353
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,580
now thunderously is the growth of new

354
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,280
AIS that actually automate that visual

355
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,440
integration visual investigation process

356
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,390
of being able to predict what you're

357
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,570
going to be able to click on and provide

358
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,610
the best answer going forward the next

359
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,700
part of cutting-edge is really the use

360
00:14:53,610 --> 00:15:00,240
of machine learning notebooks so the

361
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,790
ability to be able to create your own

362
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,520
machine learning classifiers train your

363
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:08,699
own data sets be able to

364
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,430
provide a almost an advanced scripting

365
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,930
approach to automate a hunting going

366
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,160
forward more importantly be able to take

367
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,380
these take these notebooks and be able

368
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,170
to pass them on to other teams inside

369
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:26,399
your organization or be able to share

370
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:28,740
them as playbooks externally and once

371
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
the third slot there I could create many

372
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,350
many slides on this year but if it delay

373
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,959
AI right so at the at the large public

374
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,149
cloud sites at cloud service providers

375
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,790
side AI is pretty much everything that

376
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:45,420
goes on behind the scenes here so for

377
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:47,969
example a key things that I'm most

378
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,180
interested from the AI side kill chain

379
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,670
and attack or reassembly should we clear

380
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,170
here does everyone raise your hand if

381
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,860
you don't know anything about school

382
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:03,170
chains raise your hand if you don't know

383
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,040
that mitre attack framework okay a few

384
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,270
unfortunately there's only a few of you

385
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,770
here are you happy to talk about a

386
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,750
little bit later but the attack

387
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,279
framework is really where a lot of the

388
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,320
technologies are now changing and moving

389
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,270
to so you know upgrading from cool

390
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,510
trainer type approaches into the attack

391
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,199
framework and attack reassembly also

392
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,790
moving onto nominated based detection

393
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,790
auto training of classifiers so the

394
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:29,490
ability to train up an AI to solve a

395
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:32,939
particular class of threats or to

396
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,620
identify a kill chain and be able to

397
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,240
then take that model and deploy

398
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,100
somewhere else and to relearn a new

399
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,339
environment so for example for me to be

400
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:46,529
able to take a create a machine learning

401
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:49,829
algorithm for spotting impossible travel

402
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:53,430
type scenarios for email brute-forcing

403
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:56,790
or email access train that up inside the

404
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,859
nsrc socket and then be able to deploy

405
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,770
that into on-premise seemed forever

406
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,260
customers and for it to relearn and to

407
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,670
be able to stop detecting new that class

408
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,670
of threat almost immediately

409
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,740
give you an idea of scale and why this

410
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:17,369
is important okay

411
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,589
so one of the things that as a cloud

412
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,908
provider perhaps one of the most common

413
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:26,398
scary attacks that I see is this

414
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:30,059
particular event so what happens is that

415
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:32,010
some bad guys guessed the password or

416
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,879
the login credentials for a customer's

417
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,350
workspace so for their subscription so

418
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,320
they compromised the identity of the

419
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:42,059
subscription owner they then log in they

420
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,070
create a service principle so if Italy a

421
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,019
new account for being able to manage the

422
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,149
the workloads or manage the subscription

423
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:50,010
they then add that newly created

424
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,510
principle to the admin for that

425
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,320
subscription and then they start doing

426
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,669
bad things

427
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,529
so extricated data locking out systems

428
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:01,320
spitting up Bitcoin mining all these

429
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:04,100
sort of things so that first thing you

430
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,370
know looking for these types of things

431
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:11,158
you know how do I go about this so today

432
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,590
you know using the from the azure

433
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,860
customer's perspective I see about 300

434
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,199
billion identity logins right per month

435
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,289
4.1 billion active directory admin

436
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,039
actions in about 3.2 billion as your

437
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:28,019
admin actions okay so you can mention if

438
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,080
you had your seam store on-premise I've

439
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,429
probably filled up your seam already

440
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,510
just with the data that you know that's

441
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:38,159
required for looking at there's one

442
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:40,200
class of threats now as I started using

443
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,210
user behaviors and start looking at

444
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,860
anomalous behaviour for those detections

445
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,159
that can start shrinking these things

446
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,959
down right so if I'm looking for if I

447
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:51,059
can start identifying behaviors say that

448
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,370
these actions happen ants weakens our

449
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,200
happen in sequence and they were

450
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,908
happening at a time that is you know

451
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,519
outside the normal business hours of

452
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:01,740
that organization and things like this

453
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,440
right I can start shrinking that down to

454
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,210
about 28 million so great for billions

455
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,730
down to millions of identity detections

456
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,950
you know 20 million anomalous active

457
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:15,230
directory actions and two million

458
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,230
anomalous as your Azure actions

459
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:21,639
now if I'm smart I start converting into

460
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,380
graph type relationships okay

461
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,059
and so the graph taught relationships I

462
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:27,880
then start applying probabilistic kill

463
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:30,129
chain model to this okay and so I start

464
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,809
bringing all that all that data down to

465
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:36,130
a 50 320 graphs or sub graphs which you

466
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:40,660
know it's a big month at the moment

467
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:42,190
rates at about 18 cases okay so if you

468
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,080
sort of think from from an analyst

469
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,330
perspective without that the use of

470
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,010
artificial intelligence but more

471
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,559
particularly the use of graft it might

472
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,730
graphic technologies I was still be

473
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,920
trying to sift through those three

474
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,820
hundred plus billion events to find out

475
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,400
some you know which ones are actually

476
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:02,020
resulted in something we're bout to

477
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,940
result something bad okay so so from my

478
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,670
perspective and as we as we go forward

479
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,400
from as a cloud provider I have to

480
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,080
approach everything from this type of

481
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,300
scale okay

482
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,909
anything that I start looking at that

483
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:19,240
requires those starts or requires a

484
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,070
human to be involved in is going to be a

485
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,510
failure from the first start right so I

486
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,409
have to look at a different different

487
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,179
way so what we've also had over the time

488
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,170
is that there's been changes in the way

489
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:33,520
that hunters think okay so was all about

490
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,260
alerts yeah

491
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,389
let's go you know we'll stack these

492
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,309
alerts from green through to reds or

493
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,530
into brown depending on your car theme

494
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:43,899
yeah and you start with a bound and work

495
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,370
down okay then we start moving on to

496
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,660
event correlations so just instead of

497
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,100
looking for individual alert sort of

498
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,750
bring these alerts together as clusters

499
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,409
and be able to say this these number

500
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:56,260
alerts represented a kill an attack

501
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,510
pattern right and that have had and then

502
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,910
develops into timelines and kill chain

503
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,440
reassembly for the last couple of years

504
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,360
there's mode you know that's changed

505
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,710
into the mitre attack framework yeah and

506
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,559
being able to build up the Year the

507
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,830
attack attribution that goes behind

508
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,660
there and we're today from for a

509
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,370
machine-learning site particular is that

510
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:21,610
of a labeling and the training of

511
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:23,860
response systems interesting one here

512
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,809
what he is from a threat hunter

513
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,270
perspective you know for for many

514
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:30,220
organizations almost the

515
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,129
the role as a security professional the

516
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,260
role that many people aspire to today is

517
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,940
the threat hunter right and particularly

518
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,030
to be that the top the best threat

519
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,680
hunters there are inside an organization

520
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:45,460
the question of god though is that with

521
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:50,080
all the data that's coming in into your

522
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:53,140
organization how many of you here do

523
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,990
three hunting of some degree ok so most

524
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,610
of the hands here how many of you you

525
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,110
know raise your hand if you you if you

526
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,060
spend more of your day proactively

527
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,070
hunting as opposed to having to just

528
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,460
clean up and investigate stuff that

529
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:09,280
someone else pointed out ok three or

530
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,630
four hands ok so the interesting thing

531
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,850
is that despite all these types of

532
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,460
technologies that are out there and they

533
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,340
the growth of tray hunting threat

534
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,700
hunting is still largely about instant

535
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:26,939
response and retroactive looking at

536
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,940
threats investigation of threats ok

537
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:32,530
what we're also finding though is that

538
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:36,250
we're getting more data so our ability

539
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,200
to acquire and process data and so the

540
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,050
cloud has resulted in customers and

541
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,610
organizations turning on more logging

542
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,010
richer logging more events and passing

543
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,560
more data through and so we're into this

544
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:50,260
sort of you know hamster wheel of more

545
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,139
data creating more work providing more

546
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,879
visibility into the threats however we

547
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,580
have less time to investigate them from

548
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,320
a human perspective and from you know

549
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,879
from a human perspective were also it's

550
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,840
getting further away from when the event

551
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,420
actually happens so we're doing

552
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,590
retractors retroactive hunting now an

553
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,740
interesting part of that really

554
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,899
translates into it used to be from a

555
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,870
funding perspective it was hunting for

556
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,580
needles in the haystack ok now if the

557
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,500
types of systems that we have what we

558
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,990
end up is that we end up with a haystack

559
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,180
of needles instead more often than not

560
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,510
we've now moved on from a haystack of

561
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,640
needles into haystacks labeled haystacks

562
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,740
with needles right and so we have to

563
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,910
figure out ways to prioritize the way

564
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,380
that we investigate going forward so

565
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,540
that privatization comes in minis or

566
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,140
reforms and so you know a large part of

567
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:47,450
today really focuses on

568
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,550
how do we train AI systems to understand

569
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,000
to replicate what the human beings doing

570
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,889
how do we you know engage the human and

571
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,630
the labeling process but how do we

572
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,160
actually score these types of events and

573
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,010
so that we can really you know we can

574
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,480
reprioritize those what so what we're

575
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,210
seeing is a lot of integration of

576
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,250
combining internal intelligence and

577
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,680
third-party intelligence together yeah

578
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:13,400
and in the case of the attack framework

579
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,410
also the TTP's you know tools tectus and

580
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,230
processes of the bad guys to be able to

581
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,780
provide attribution but as haystacks

582
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:23,330
themselves keep on growing okay and so

583
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:27,080
despite for many organizations they may

584
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:30,260
break their hunting teams into malware

585
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,990
teams apt teams and other specialized

586
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,940
threats those hey states just keep on

587
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,170
growing so move you know so for many

588
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,940
organizations what we're finding is that

589
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,010
there still swamps no matter how many

590
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,090
more people that come on what we also

591
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,280
find is that the more security

592
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,459
acknowledges that deployed the more

593
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:49,639
haystacks wind up creating needle stack

594
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,100
should we same so that sort of moves

595
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,100
really on to cloud native threat hunting

596
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,540
okay so we have to relook at all the

597
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,330
tooling and all the process that we've

598
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,879
used in the past and Nunley reinvent

599
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,429
them that's fundamentally changed the

600
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:09,410
way we do these things so first of all

601
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:11,510
all the data all the time okay so let me

602
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,840
evaluate data is no longer a bubble next

603
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,250
a retention period is important ideally

604
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,600
as a threat hunter you want to get as

605
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,760
much as that data and stored it for as

606
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,370
long as possible however if you ask your

607
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,650
CFO you know your chief legal officer

608
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,090
they'll probably say no more than seven

609
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,470
years or no more than three years

610
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,990
because of the legal constraints that

611
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,670
are on this on these things it also

612
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,970
means that you can hunt across larger

613
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,100
periods of time with new TI okay so if

614
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:39,250
you're about seven years you may get the

615
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,360
latest batch of threat intelligence from

616
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,800
Verizon report or whatever you can go

617
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,570
back through those seven years and find

618
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,389
out when you were there may have been

619
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,379
potentially compromised through that the

620
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,300
other part is actually learning from

621
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,670
every single successful hunt so from the

622
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,860
good guys side you know as you find

623
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,630
and stuff through this type of data find

624
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,360
these particular threats being able to

625
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,190
describe that threat and labeling its

626
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,330
machine then learns from that and so

627
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,140
that you don't need to repeat that

628
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:07,580
process going forward ok and there's of

629
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,880
course to assemble and collate all that

630
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,500
data together so what are these things

631
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,770
that look like you know here's just a

632
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,020
snapshot of as your Sentinel from two

633
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,030
weeks ago before I was traveling here

634
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:23,510
what you see is a difference of approach

635
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,960
to from the threat analyst perspective

636
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,220
so here what I've just grabbed is the

637
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,260
different way of looking at the hunting

638
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,930
procedure so you sort of see in this top

639
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,750
right-hand corner the mitre attack

640
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,400
framework so being able to take instead

641
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,310
of having a look at an entire kill chain

642
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,170
and try to piece together a kill chain

643
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,780
from a graphical pace a graphical

644
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,220
perspective start breaking the down

645
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:50,450
breaking that down to individual

646
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:53,630
components so for example long genus URI

647
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,550
queries for example which is part of you

648
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,850
know it was a row so she netted with a

649
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,950
number of TTP's for bad actors and start

650
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:04,689
managing and hunting on that and that

651
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,800
aspect what you see is this gage of

652
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,300
providing the attack framework the

653
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,940
ability to search and hunt on these

654
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,070
individual things or collectively and

655
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,870
ability to modify create your own

656
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:21,560
queries and then build compound queries

657
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:23,689
going forward if that's one way of sort

658
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,909
of viewing how other technologies that

659
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:32,210
are changing I think the next part

660
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:36,350
really is understanding what the clouds

661
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:39,980
and cloudy I actually brings the table

662
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:42,350
from a security experience so here made

663
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,030
up some graph here say if you like a

664
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,620
two-dimensional layout of all the

665
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:46,610
different threats and alerts over time

666
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,919
that are happening inside your

667
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,389
organization you know in traditional way

668
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,790
what would happen is that we would look

669
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:55,610
at these particular events build up a

670
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,320
timeline and call that near attack

671
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:59,300
timeline and you know this would be

672
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,360
perhaps our kill chain that would be

673
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,340
studying

674
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,520
how we got there was in one of two ways

675
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:09,370
right at some point something was

676
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,800
flashing loud enough red inner flashing

677
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,889
the most or law enforcement knocked on

678
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,020
their door and said is this your set of

679
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,820
data you associate that one particular

680
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,500
event and you start mapping everything

681
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:23,110
that was associated event back in time

682
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,610
to eventually get to that the starts and

683
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,360
say let's say the start was a little bit

684
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,889
brute-forcing for example right the

685
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,520
other way is that I have all this data

686
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:38,140
and I am now giving a little piece of

687
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:42,190
threat intelligence of a second of a

688
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,630
command and control server and I look

689
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:46,180
through my logs and I find that that

690
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,590
command and crawl server was used at

691
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,960
this particular time and I start booking

692
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,959
on my kill chain in both directions okay

693
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,010
when I walk out of the combination of

694
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:59,379
cloud and AI I work the other direction

695
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,050
and that is I start from the very first

696
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,640
events and I start you know for every

697
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:05,919
one of those events that I see I start

698
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,630
mapping up probability is that this this

699
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,430
event is going to go and is going to be

700
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,350
connected to another event and whether

701
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,140
that probability of that neck and second

702
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:18,419
event is going to lead to a type of

703
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:21,220
threat type of TTP or an aspect of

704
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,200
maliciousness and so what happens that

705
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,360
over time as I see these events

706
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,640
cascading I'm eventually I'm able to

707
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,379
alert and provide insight saying that

708
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,750
you know I'm starting to build up a cool

709
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,980
chamber arrived in a earlier description

710
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,970
of that this is hitting towards

711
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,500
something bad okay so while that's

712
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,450
happening the other parts that are

713
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,760
fundamentally changing is the way that's

714
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:45,130
user and event behavior and elixirs

715
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,500
coming into play so today much of the

716
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,060
you know on-premise Yui be a type

717
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:54,840
technologies are focused on the network

718
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:58,810
layer right or you know within slides

719
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,230
mmm say the top protection Suites

720
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,550
installed on the actual host okay so

721
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,650
what's happening there is that I'm

722
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,919
looking in real-time at the raw data and

723
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,770
I am creating new you EBA alerts on the

724
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,730
fly from the

725
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:14,020
when I'm looking at from the same

726
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:15,520
perspective I'm working in a different

727
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,530
way right from the same perspective

728
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,170
you've got to assume that I don't have

729
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:21,460
you know the seam doesn't have presence

730
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,830
on the endpoint and doesn't have

731
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,300
presence at the network instead that's

732
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,560
reliant on all those other security

733
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,250
technologies that are really there that

734
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,490
are creating new alerts new events new

735
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,830
incidents are just raw telemetry so the

736
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,680
traditional way from a 3ua you EBA

737
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,020
perspective was assume the attacker only

738
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,640
takes one path to attain their goal it

739
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,129
assumes the attacker follows the static

740
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,410
kill chain and that they attack path is

741
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,710
fully executed and also assumes the

742
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:56,050
information is present in all the logs

743
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:57,670
okay that breaks most the time right and

744
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,350
so from a cloud state perspective I'm

745
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,510
applying AI we do it in two different

746
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,949
ways so first of all the derivative

747
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:08,980
iterative attack simulation so as I

748
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:10,630
receive new logs new events I'm trying

749
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,440
to predict where it's actually going to

750
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,110
go and I'm going to assign probabilities

751
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,610
for these predictions and so I'm going

752
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,439
to fuse these different events that I'm

753
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,659
seeing in collating and be able to map

754
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,250
those against certain scenarios or text

755
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,620
simulations that I care about the motion

756
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,790
the organization what I'm also doing is

757
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,090
I'm going to provide a problem list at

758
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,899
kill chain right so as these events are

759
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,639
happening in these fusion of the

760
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,860
different events are coming together I'm

761
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,170
going to try to predict which way this

762
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,659
event is actually going and what servers

763
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,480
and what's the risk and priority and

764
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,030
also the overall impact organization as

765
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,610
it goes forward and then also using

766
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,520
advances and graphical methods I'm also

767
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:53,110
basically putting in random stuff into

768
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,700
those predictions just in case I might

769
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:57,040
have missed an event or a class of

770
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,540
technology wasn't deployed or something

771
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,680
happens to that I'm going to assume

772
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,720
they're going to miss out certain types

773
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,380
of data and so I can project an advanced

774
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,380
going forward

775
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:12,120
what else is happening in this space I

776
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:14,730
think one of the newer interesting areas

777
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,518
is AI powered for intelligence in

778
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,769
particular forecasting so I started

779
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,809
before I got into security my background

780
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,990
as an atmospheric physics and

781
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:26,700
meteorology if you like that the first

782
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,799
you know bigger uses of supercomputing

783
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,769
before everyone got into the nuclear

784
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,330
trade should we're saying but the

785
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,490
forecasting is an important part and so

786
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:41,070
where we are now seeing we're now seeing

787
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:42,809
the first generation of AI based threat

788
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,029
intelligent systems commercial threat

789
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,289
intelligence systems so for example you

790
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:49,049
know being able to take all that cloud

791
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:51,149
information the last 30 years of

792
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,870
Internet traffic domain used domain

793
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:56,639
abuse malware malware analytics bring

794
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,129
them all together and then be able to

795
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:02,219
fuse and project with these things are

796
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:06,149
going so for example one company based

797
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,070
in san diego's ecliptics provides an

798
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:10,678
average of 51 days in advance

799
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,870
notification that an IP or domain name

800
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,120
is going to be used for badness and what

801
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:19,018
that badness is going to be with things

802
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,239
secondly 97% probability right

803
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,399
everyone's like notice technologies are

804
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,200
we looking at the threat actor answers

805
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,580
the threat actor you know you choose

806
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,190
your list of threats actor that you care

807
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,830
about and you're notified in real time

808
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,260
we know what's new infrastructure the

809
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,210
bad guys are set up but it also provides

810
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,350
near prediction of what their what the

811
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,940
infrastructure is probably going to be

812
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,189
used for and what campaigns it's going

813
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,570
to be used for today so these are cool

814
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,570
types of technologies but you know if

815
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:48,928
you sort of think of how would I apply

816
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:50,250
these from you know from my existing

817
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:52,230
types of security technologies and this

818
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,200
is where it gets interesting of being up

819
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:59,159
reply prediction systems into cloud seam

820
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,659
so that you know you can pull one you

821
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:02,730
can watch the Internet as a whole as a

822
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,289
cloud provider and then predict how

823
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,760
those changes that you're observing in

824
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:08,679
the cloud are going to affect that and

825
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,418
potentially result in the techs against

826
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,009
your customers and against their

827
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:16,779
workloads so from a 300 perspective we

828
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:18,099
mapped out you know though those

829
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:20,949
particular events in a bit of a kill

830
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:22,929
chain or if you also do as you're using

831
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:25,178
graft technologies you can build out all

832
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:26,379
those other associations so while if I

833
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,649
was looking through events I was just

834
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:31,210
tracking back from you know from the the

835
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:33,549
most evil back to the original start

836
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,529
there are not a lot of other activities

837
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:38,168
that the bad guys we're doing at the

838
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:39,998
same time right and the types of tools

839
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:41,109
the types of systems they they touched

840
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:46,328
and things like that

841
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:47,918
this becomes a mix of TTP's and provides

842
00:34:46,329 --> 00:34:52,029
a little bit of a fingerprint for either

843
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:56,109
a bad gal operator a type of tool that

844
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:59,460
they're using for automation or a class

845
00:34:56,109 --> 00:35:02,229
of attacks and so effectively by

846
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:06,039
combining those together if I see these

847
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:07,538
types of you know shapes in the data I

848
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:11,650
can start building and training

849
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:14,019
classifiers for this right so today you

850
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,849
can do yourself or just part of a cloud

851
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:17,229
seam you just say you know here are

852
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:20,890
these three attacks I think they're all

853
00:35:17,229 --> 00:35:23,140
roughly the same click a button go build

854
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,819
a classifier check that classifier

855
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,049
against your data and see if you've seen

856
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:28,210
other threats that are very much like

857
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:31,569
this right and labeled a classifier

858
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:33,999
that's great for a you know which were

859
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:35,890
active hunting perspective paths that

860
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:38,109
are much more interested though are how

861
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,759
do I get ahead of the threats and start

862
00:35:38,109 --> 00:35:44,109
proactive hunting for these things and

863
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:47,170
so if I still look at that type of you

864
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:51,279
know shape that that cluster that's the

865
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,729
machine learning instance we're along

866
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:55,960
this process am i comfortable with a

867
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:59,890
probability that is going to lead to

868
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:03,339
badness right completely artificial made

869
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,558
up in here right at some point I say I'm

870
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:07,630
98% and my student five percent twenty

871
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:11,650
percent you know at what point am I

872
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:13,299
comfortable with this and so what's

873
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,400
happening and this is why the attack

874
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:17,559
like the mitre attack framework is so

875
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,519
important if I can take these smaller

876
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:22,080
chunks here these TTP's or phases of an

877
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,229
attack

878
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,210
I can raise my confidence of being able

879
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,890
to detect these things but I can also

880
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:30,210
overlay those with a framework off the

881
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,970
threats that I really care about these

882
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:35,520
bigger these bigger trains and labelled

883
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,109
threats and I can start doing things a

884
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,810
little bit differently in particular I

885
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,069
think one of the biggest things for one

886
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,470
of the newest things from attack

887
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,410
mitigation for a cloud it really has now

888
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,848
become conditional access controls so

889
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,440
what conditional access controls allow

890
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:54,750
me to do is that it is now possible to

891
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,310
for the systems to for the cloud to

892
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:03,000
identify who the user is who the victim

893
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:05,040
is who the attacker is and we're in the

894
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,680
attack process they actually are so for

895
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,810
example Microsoft cloud knows that

896
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,598
Controlman is currently logged in here

897
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,400
myself and when I last authenticated was

898
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,330
here roughly the same location

899
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,800
I used the pin number two on Windows

900
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,630
hello to open this machine

901
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,040
so for example and because their

902
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,560
PowerPoint open and we connect on the

903
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,759
Internet probably the last time I made a

904
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,619
change to the PowerPoint was

905
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,849
automatically backed up so the word

906
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:32,250
knows all this types information already

907
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:36,270
now the bad guys that say that someone

908
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:38,670
over in Singapore has a brute-force

909
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,560
existing brute force you know after you

910
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,450
know tried five times against the big

911
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,230
adramal accounts or password and the

912
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:47,580
sixth time those successful okay so

913
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,580
first of all the cloud knows that that's

914
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,348
is a different instance I've got Drammen

915
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,380
here at leonarda's over the end the

916
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:57,930
first part right through the machine

917
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,210
learning side it could also say well

918
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,700
actually I did see this brute force in

919
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,230
which i think is suspicious and the

920
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,490
probability that this could be a start

921
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,160
of a ransomware attack is 16% for

922
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,598
example so because it's so high then

923
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,660
what I will do as a conditional access

924
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,130
is take what I will just turn goodness

925
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,710
permissions on these servers to be

926
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,839
read-only okay and at the same time

927
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,330
maybe it's not Ventura or maybe it is

928
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,750
gun sure and so they used the password

929
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,819
and so I'm going to ask for a different

930
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:30,540
biometric for that particular instance

931
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,130
right

932
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,240
and what that biometric is being

933
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:37,100
calculated so for example prompt the MFA

934
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,229
I've also disabled admin permissions

935
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,350
that are going on and so what happens is

936
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,760
that the the systems are able to

937
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:45,710
uniquely identify but take actions

938
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,180
against the bad guys without

939
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,520
interrupting me while I'm doing this

940
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,830
okay you know traditionally what

941
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,890
happened is that's you know a detection

942
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,420
of that my counter being brute force and

943
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,460
compromised which will then happen

944
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,470
that's the result would be my account

945
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,730
would be locked out my machine would

946
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,990
then prompt me up now here since I've

947
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,670
now been locked out close all the

948
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,799
applications and changed my password so

949
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,120
the ability to separate these functions

950
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,730
is highly important going forward

951
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,009
warrant without interrupting users and

952
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,010
also for mitigating the threat before it

953
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:18,380
actually evolves into something bad

954
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,090
so cloud affects their number of key

955
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,600
things is that first let's step back

956
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,220
here if you imagine that yeah you're

957
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,319
running your organization you have your

958
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:29,540
workloads in the clouds you see this

959
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,440
amount of the clouds from a cloud

960
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:36,470
operators perspective I see across all

961
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,030
those clouds right not looking into your

962
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,459
data but looking at all the events that

963
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:44,240
happen around those data on that so for

964
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:47,390
example you know I can tell you and tell

965
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,890
the entire cloud to win a certain IP

966
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,049
address that is never ever touched

967
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,660
there's a cloud and has never or may

968
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:56,180
never have touched port 22 now suddenly

969
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,350
starts doing their I know that and then

970
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,990
I can apply that knowledge across the

971
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:02,049
entire organization rights and so I can

972
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:04,879
start labeling so this is such a normal

973
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:07,160
appeal ittle bit careful about this the

974
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,360
so call so you know there's models for

975
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,009
detecting threats inside your

976
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,780
organization I can take those threat

977
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,970
those models and apply to large data

978
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,500
sense refine those and be kind of

979
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,750
hanging them spot different classes of

980
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,640
threats and learn against those threats

981
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,660
and then try to smaller models that can

982
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,460
be deployed inside your own

983
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,970
organizations what it means is the other

984
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,880
way around

985
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:33,020
and that is essays somewhere else in the

986
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,780
clouds a new attack is detected fix

987
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,670
someone else you know I can see in this

988
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,700
example as a watering a hall and there's

989
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:42,290
a tech command and control and from

990
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,930
there I could deduce the threat

991
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:47,660
intelligence or CIA and the TTP's and so

992
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,419
from the clouds perspective is that if a

993
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,370
threat or

994
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,950
successful or a type of compromise that

995
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,600
gets labeled from from anywhere inside

996
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,399
the cloud I can then apply that

997
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,069
knowledge preemptively to everywhere

998
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,220
else inside the clouds okay

999
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:06,030
and so the bigger the cloud becomes the

1000
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:10,009
more the the faster the rest of the

1001
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,010
cloud becomes immune to these attacks

1002
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,340
now from operating that slide

1003
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,750
unfortunate one of the key things is I

1004
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,500
end up ditching a lot of human

1005
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:21,480
constraints okay so I need to start

1006
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,190
thinking about you know these logs and

1007
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,600
things that were human readable yeah do

1008
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,130
they need to be human readable insects

1009
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,720
one of the biggest constraints they have

1010
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:31,230
today is I received

1011
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,089
52:24 basically syslog okay here is

1012
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,040
something that is over 20 years old and

1013
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:38,030
defined for allowing humans to read what

1014
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,160
the machines are basically spewing out I

1015
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:43,500
also need to move to real time not quite

1016
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,509
real time or real time TM type responses

1017
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,940
right so I need to be able to respond

1018
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,580
observe these events as fast as possible

1019
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,970
and take actions as these events are

1020
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:55,380
being created and also need to propose

1021
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,020
mitigations and responses to those

1022
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,820
threats so what does that mean from a

1023
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,770
thrill hunter perspective okay so today

1024
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,500
if I look at a typical threat hunter

1025
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:07,860
role you know stay for the bottom tier 1

1026
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,230
tier 2 tier 3 so effectively tier 1

1027
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:13,650
you know false positives false was the

1028
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:15,600
removal you know type of things tier 2

1029
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,700
there's a script for that there is a

1030
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,130
procedure there is a methodology for

1031
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,720
that go deal with it and tier 3

1032
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:24,450
basically anything that skips those two

1033
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,100
paces right but of proactive hunting and

1034
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,600
certain response being a bit of a

1035
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,480
security architect also a risk

1036
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,279
commentator from a cloud perspective

1037
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,920
today if you're in a cloud what's the

1038
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,580
role of the threat hunter effectively

1039
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,140
tier 3 analysts but a proactive hunting

1040
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:42,120
and the role of the security architects

1041
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,100
become much more important the risk

1042
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,900
commentator so instead of being able to

1043
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,279
say the sky is falling this

1044
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,260
vulnerability you should be scared about

1045
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,820
to now be able to say that vulnerability

1046
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:53,370
is there but here are the things they

1047
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,010
can do to protect against this and train

1048
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,270
the machine to remediate that you also

1049
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,840
need to become a little bit of be a bit

1050
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:01,370
of a data scientist and you also have

1051
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:05,810
what a larger role becoming a

1052
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:07,700
machine-learning trainer where this is

1053
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:09,500
really going away if I have to lay bits

1054
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,410
on the next three to five years then I

1055
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,180
think that hunting role becomes quite

1056
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,069
different again I think the proactive

1057
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,720
hunting goes away many because the

1058
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,640
machines you have to operate at real

1059
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,480
time and so the pro active hunting

1060
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,799
becomes entirely machine based what also

1061
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,470
sort of see is that Security Act to

1062
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,840
becoming a cloud security architect and

1063
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:31,879
the data scientist piece is only

1064
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,990
temporary part of time because we're

1065
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,490
still evolving those types of the

1066
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,669
analogies and I think data scientist

1067
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:40,490
role goes away as part of the security

1068
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,980
agreement and we've gone from an email

1069
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,629
training to Al trainer AR trainer and so

1070
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,600
the two big things that are pulled out

1071
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:50,140
so one is you know how these roles are

1072
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,759
changing and that is from a you know

1073
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,920
chicken little disguise falling type of

1074
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:59,330
commentary to being able to be that

1075
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,490
business risk explain what that means is

1076
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:04,220
that as an organization moves to the

1077
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:07,540
clouds all of that infrastructure the

1078
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:13,359
pen testing the red teaming all of that

1079
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:17,150
managing clusters managing containers

1080
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:19,490
managing civilus types functions than

1081
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,750
that you don't need to do anymore

1082
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,069
because it's the responsibility the

1083
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,810
cloud provider but what it means is that

1084
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:25,040
the biggest weakness and anything you've

1085
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,170
ever pushed to the cloud will be the

1086
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,790
code that you push as an organization

1087
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,730
and so it becomes more important

1088
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:35,150
understanding what the business logic is

1089
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,190
and be able to protect that and we also

1090
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,440
see is that you know what today is

1091
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:41,420
you know sixty plus percent of most

1092
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,680
threat hunters role and federally

1093
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,900
disappearing down to just the Tier three

1094
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,899
type analyst type of role okay

1095
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,210
so running up on time here and I'm

1096
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:55,880
thinking few nursing pictures here to

1097
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:58,880
see if he ones awake what do you think

1098
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:01,780
ties all of these pictures together if

1099
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,670
you're sort of thinking of technology

1100
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,650
transportation yes a little bit more

1101
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:12,820
precise

1102
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:14,960
okay roads a little bit true true but

1103
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,300
what brings all these things together

1104
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,260
how we've designed our latest cars there

1105
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:23,870
are trained buses roads infrastructure

1106
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,520
is that everything's down yeah even the

1107
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:27,319
containers that we ship things down is

1108
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,509
designed by the width of two horses

1109
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,180
asses okay

1110
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:34,640
so entire so four and a half thousand

1111
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:41,210
years of evolution of transport is down

1112
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:43,190
to the width of two horses okay so when

1113
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,880
I think of what AI and how we're playing

1114
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,830
AI to security today on try rethinking

1115
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,240
this you know so today you've you know

1116
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,370
we talked about supervised and

1117
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,680
unsupervised learning a large part right

1118
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,299
so we're aligned on the human and we so

1119
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,620
we have our aspects of how we've

1120
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,720
traditionally approached these types of

1121
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,310
roles before we've also had the same

1122
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,020
data sets you know a million should melt

1123
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:06,860
syslog so these are things that were

1124
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:08,150
designed to be human readable okay what

1125
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,980
if I move away from these things that we

1126
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:12,380
human readable let the machines actually

1127
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,600
enrich the data in ways that's we have

1128
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,440
we we humans can't no longer deal with

1129
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:21,110
all right and yeah what about when I

1130
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,790
start focusing on yeah faster do I want

1131
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,200
to go too fast for a bit of human to

1132
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:30,500
solve these types of problems were solve

1133
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:31,609
a different way okay and so it's a

1134
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,830
question about you know what am I trying

1135
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:37,940
to do am I trying to you know build the

1136
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,470
superhuman AI threat hunter or am I

1137
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:41,720
trying to solve the individual pieces to

1138
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,370
that so if you like the you know the

1139
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,970
first world's that the first robot

1140
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:48,290
citizen versus the the Roomba or the you

1141
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,549
know you know lawn mower or the

1142
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,860
driverless cars and things like that

1143
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:54,350
well though I just sort of see this you

1144
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:57,170
know this fully automated lawn mower and

1145
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,549
I I didn't see any stickers about it

1146
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,550
being pit friendly so

1147
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:04,810
yeah and from my perspective we're not

1148
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,640
we look at the clouds and that's and

1149
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,340
where we are today I much prefer to go

1150
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,020
on the second route of you know get a

1151
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,790
new machine to specialize and solve

1152
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:15,520
these particular problems at this point

1153
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:17,140
in time it also means if I change the

1154
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,460
medium if I change the way that I look

1155
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:21,279
at this particular problem I can in

1156
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:24,220
start changing the way that I handle the

1157
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,840
threats so if I moved away from yes it's

1158
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,480
a mid-air travel or the sea travel I'm

1159
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:31,120
no longer bound by the roads or that you

1160
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,560
know the width of two horses and so if I

1161
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,720
start changing the medium start looking

1162
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,040
at different ways of approaching AI and

1163
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,189
different ways of approaching deadest

1164
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,960
origins with and within the clouds then

1165
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,920
perhaps I'm going to open up new ways of

1166
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,500
thinking about and solving these

1167
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,380
problems going forward so the evolution

1168
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:50,020
of machine learning I think is a key

1169
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:53,410
part here and that is what I'm what I'm

1170
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,390
guessing is you know as the cloud has

1171
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,950
become more centralized and has more

1172
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:58,990
data or what we're also seeing is the

1173
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,730
growth of the intelligent edge okay so

1174
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,709
what we're seeing there is that we

1175
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,450
require more compute to also happen on

1176
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,070
the edge points of the cloud and also

1177
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:09,040
the edge point of those touching of

1178
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:11,320
those technologies and so I think what

1179
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,490
we're at the cusp of doing today is

1180
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:18,580
moving away in parallel of instead of

1181
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,439
having just the AI central in saying

1182
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,850
bring me all the data in one place and

1183
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,700
I'm gonna analyze a little bit of a

1184
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:27,490
superhuman type aspect is that I need to

1185
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,529
also have AI systems that are on the

1186
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,790
very edge of my network you know on the

1187
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:33,760
very edge of the clouds and make those

1188
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:35,800
first pass decisions all right and one

1189
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,230
way of sort of thinking of this is you

1190
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,080
know as data volumes increase as speed

1191
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,000
of connections increase as the speed of

1192
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,730
the threat comes yeah I've got to Bethel

1193
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,730
you know I'm as Microsoft I'm already

1194
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:51,070
battling machine learning and I power to

1195
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:53,050
tax systems are against me already so I

1196
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,870
have to operate at those speeds if not

1197
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,670
faster right and so it's that sort of

1198
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,920
thinking about if you like from a

1199
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,230
military side I want those smart

1200
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,730
lieutenants at the edge facing the rule

1201
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,230
part of the battle dealing with the

1202
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,710
attacks as they come in making those

1203
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:11,430
decisions but it also wants to

1204
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:13,589
grow and groom those generals from an AI

1205
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,299
perspective centrally taking up the next

1206
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:16,470
four or five steps in advance of how am

1207
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,089
I going to not only mitigate this

1208
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,640
particular threat but how am I going to

1209
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:26,060
remove the attacker from the system or

1210
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:29,549
from the internet at the same time so

1211
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:33,240
things do i Minar the beverages with

1212
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:35,580
friends or beers tonight I think from 8

1213
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,919
o'clock tonight I think it was four

1214
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,960
beers tonight so speed of response the

1215
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,130
human is the bottleneck you know if

1216
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,170
you're doing things in the cloud and

1217
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:45,150
thinking about 12 security and that and

1218
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:48,420
you rely on humans that and humans are

1219
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:51,240
part of that process step back look at

1220
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,130
other ways approaching this so threat

1221
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,009
hunting will change but for the bitter

1222
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,990
all the time from everywhere so the

1223
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:00,180
machines do this thing a lot better than

1224
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:02,160
we can right at this stage they're still

1225
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,470
learning from us we're still training

1226
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,819
these types of systems but even then we

1227
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:08,669
give them the data volumes and types of

1228
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,099
things they can find it's you know it's

1229
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:15,150
clear the machines winning in the space

1230
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:17,280
on their behalf okay so what used to be

1231
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,050
you know if the Nemesis for a threat

1232
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,140
hunter or a security person was there's

1233
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:23,760
really events there's anomalies machine

1234
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:25,049
learning systems excel at finding

1235
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,490
anomalies that's the easiest thing they

1236
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,500
can possibly find find those anomalies

1237
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,868
the hard part is you know giving those

1238
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:35,640
anomalies labels and describe and then

1239
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:37,800
classified as some type of risk and as

1240
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,990
we probe this part conditional response

1241
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,490
systems so being able to use threat

1242
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:45,990
prediction being able to use AI to map

1243
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:48,629
activities as they're occurring and then

1244
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:51,359
to take small steps injected

1245
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:53,930
intelligently into those processes to

1246
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:57,750
deflect or mitigate a threat without

1247
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:59,520
compromising the current user or the

1248
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:00,869
environments that needs to run and keep

1249
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,540
on running a business systems going

1250
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:08,220
forward and the last part is yeah if you

1251
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:10,320
set your goal to be a threat threat

1252
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,290
analysts today that's not saying that

1253
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,990
yeah in two years time three years time

1254
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,609
you're gonna be at a job

1255
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,808
what's really happening though from a

1256
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:19,430
cloud perspective and for organizations

1257
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:21,440
that move to the cloud that threat

1258
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:23,720
analysts that threat hunting world is

1259
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,020
turning into a business security analyst

1260
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,970
role right and so the roles becoming

1261
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:31,099
both once be one space both more

1262
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,470
technical and understanding the class of

1263
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:35,690
threats and how the operators the bad

1264
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,549
guys operate but also becoming much more

1265
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,890
in tuned about it precisely what those

1266
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,900
what those threats mean and impacts your

1267
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:44,750
organization as a whole and being able

1268
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,280
to that translation from what is the

1269
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,109
threat and what are the AI classes is a

1270
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:54,619
threat and to mitigate into business

1271
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:56,058
systems so with that or less then I've

1272
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,010
been talking for quite some time so I'd

1273
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:00,020
like to open the floor to let you guys

1274
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:04,760
talk and maybe there's any sort

1275
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:06,259
questions out there if I stunned

1276
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:17,450
everyone to silence or as everyone it's

1277
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:20,839
like a lunch coma so do we share threat

1278
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:23,558
hunting notebooks Jupiter notebooks and

1279
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:26,390
things to that so yes you may have seen

1280
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:29,299
the bigness here at a small acquisition

1281
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:32,270
that Microsoft did called github and

1282
00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:35,420
it's part of that so we've made all of

1283
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:36,710
the azure sentinel type of threat

1284
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,280
hunting notebooks or the machine

1285
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,900
learning or jupiter notebooks and things

1286
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,160
like that are all available there and

1287
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,589
we're trying to build up that community

1288
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:48,230
I think there are lastly who was about

1289
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:52,099
8,000 different notebooks for different

1290
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:56,180
classes of threats there today you have

1291
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:59,319
a questions going once going twice

1292
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,319
done the back there

1293
00:53:06,229 --> 00:53:11,368
yeah so the question do I see big risk

1294
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:15,209
in poisoning of data behind so the

1295
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:17,249
models yes for some types of things so

1296
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:18,808
for machine learning you know and

1297
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:24,468
supervised unsupervised learning and

1298
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:24,469
some data like type problems yes

1299
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:30,619
that said I'm approaching for two

1300
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,150
different ways so one is if you were

1301
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:36,059
today for data scientist the third

1302
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:38,579
hunting part of if you like is if you're

1303
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,619
a security person and the threat hunting

1304
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,179
being three hunters that let's the apex

1305
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:46,849
if you like of your career in many ways

1306
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:51,239
for a data scientist you're your apex

1307
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:53,759
today is to be a adversarial AI you know

1308
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:55,769
analysts type of thing and so we're

1309
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:58,890
spending a lot on and figuring out new

1310
00:53:55,769 --> 00:54:01,319
ways of how to poison knowin systems and

1311
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:03,420
to to figure out how new ways these

1312
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:06,689
tanks can sort of mitigate how these

1313
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,890
types of attacks and go but we are this

1314
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:09,058
is a little bit different is that many

1315
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,828
of the the techniques that have been

1316
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:12,420
used today that you'll be published like

1317
00:54:10,829 --> 00:54:14,069
you know a stop sign and someone puts a

1318
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,049
few pieces of tape on and becomes a

1319
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:17,219
rhinoceros or whatever or turtles or

1320
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:19,679
another

1321
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:21,749
those are traditionally they're things

1322
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,529
like cognitive AI type systems and

1323
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:26,368
things like that and so we're looking at

1324
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:29,459
different approaches and so if you use

1325
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:31,589
multiple classes or models together and

1326
00:54:29,459 --> 00:54:32,848
AI systems and then ready to look at how

1327
00:54:31,589 --> 00:54:35,459
those things work together as opposed to

1328
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:37,199
solving for each one individually so

1329
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:40,319
that that's one aspect the other aspect

1330
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:44,219
is we're also looking at new ways of you

1331
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,779
know if I train the new model with a

1332
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:48,269
jupiter notebook or some other

1333
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:49,529
deliverable can I reverse engineer that

1334
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:51,508
model to be able to figure out what the

1335
00:54:49,529 --> 00:54:54,029
raw data was and still work back from

1336
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:56,359
that's right depending on how that was

1337
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:58,920
generated things are changing very fast

1338
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:01,140
what we've also found was interesting

1339
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,410
once I was advised by the Microsoft

1340
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:05,999
lawyers and a few other places was that

1341
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,279
today if you want to protect your you

1342
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:10,229
know your classifier your intellectual

1343
00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:11,410
property inside from a machine learning

1344
00:55:10,229 --> 00:55:15,529
side

1345
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:18,140
the traditional way is to use patents so

1346
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:21,410
44 the US Patent Office has said that

1347
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:24,170
you can only patent so your patent has

1348
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:26,480
to has to list the inventor the inventor

1349
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,780
has to be human so if an AI invent

1350
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,790
something you can actually use paint and

1351
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:34,700
law to protect it apparently so far

1352
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:37,960
today so there's a lot going on in the

1353
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:39,680
adversarial AI site today you know

1354
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,300
primary approaches from a security

1355
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,430
perspective are we're using multiple

1356
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,290
different classes of models and breaking

1357
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:46,580
those models into smaller chunks for and

1358
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:49,240
then really looking at conditional

1359
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:51,259
accesses our control for you know for

1360
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:58,009
actually mitigating the threat in real

1361
00:55:51,260 --> 00:56:02,480
time still got two minutes any last

1362
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:03,650
questions if that's it then thank you

1363
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,300
very much your time Cheers

1364
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:07,300
