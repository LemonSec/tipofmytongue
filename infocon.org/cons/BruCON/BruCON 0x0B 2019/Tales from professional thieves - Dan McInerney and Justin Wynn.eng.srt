1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:06,960
[Applause]

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,400
[Music]

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,190
so Justin Wynne was supposed to be my

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,230
little partner a crime here has anyone

5
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:16,329
heard of the Iowa Court case in the

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,169
states where the pen testers were

7
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:22,689
arrested yes well Justin was one of

8
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:27,249
those pen testers so you can see here

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:29,439
this is his shiny mug is still an

10
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:32,528
ongoing court case so I can't say like

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,660
too much too much about it but I'll say

12
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,180
what's public what's public is that the

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,940
state of Iowa contracted me and my

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,039
company not me specifically but I did

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,629
this gig four years ago Justin got it

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,210
this year they're doing a red team red

17
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,968
team's I mean like basically anything

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,829
goes you can fish them you can

19
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,440
impersonate an employee you can do all

20
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,660
kinds of things that a normal adversary

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,928
would do now the Iowa court system

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,879
didn't exactly or may not have I don't

23
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:03,879
really know may not have had permission

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,319
to give us permission to break into some

25
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,730
of these courthouses there was some

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,169
confusion about the language of the

27
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,390
statement of work there's some other

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,970
thing minor things but ultimately it

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,830
comes down to this the state didn't

30
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,140
really technically have permission to

31
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,360
allow us to do that so the county cops

32
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,240
show up they pick a lock or something

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,890
and they open the door and the County

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
cops show up because they tripped a

35
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,120
silent alarm and there they say oh hey

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,650
no it's no big deal we were hired to do

37
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,200
this here's our ghetto jail free card

38
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:35,410
and in this case the County cops were

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,970
like I don't respect this I don't care

40
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,170
that you have this card that says you're

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,400
allowed to do this because it's 1:00

42
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,340
a.m. in the morning and you're breaking

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,140
into a courthouse okay well I guess

44
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,240
we're going to jail then so they go to

45
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,860
jail for like a for a day they eat some

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,570
terrible ham sandwiches and then our

47
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,040
company bails him out so that's what

48
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,800
justin is not here today and I'm a

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,950
little a little miffed about that but

50
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,910
you know if he was better at red teaming

51
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,910
he wouldn't been caught so

52
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,030
so what I'm gonna do he had some great

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,760
stories too I you'll be missing out on

54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,770
those but I have plenty of stories

55
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,190
myself so what I'm gonna do is tell you

56
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,010
five techniques that I use to break into

57
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,380
about 80% of the buildings that I'm

58
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,239
hired and contracted to break into these

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,250
are gonna be the the default techniques

60
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,110
that you're gonna want to use that don't

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,700
require any skill I'd like to make that

62
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,380
one pretty clear I'm not gonna

63
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,940
lock-picking is not going to be one of

64
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,799
these these are going to be just five

65
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,900
techniques that we use to bypass

66
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,490
security mechanisms not necessarily

67
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,780
brute force our way in lock-picking

68
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,520
interestingly enough is actually

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,050
considered destructive entry because

70
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,400
when you're doing when you're picking a

71
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,110
lock you can actually break one of the

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,300
pins what caused damage to the lock that

73
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,490
makes the lock can't turn anymore so a

74
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,200
lot of places when they contact you for

75
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,910
physical security assessments will not

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,859
allow you to pick any locks to get in

77
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,960
that's actually been the most common

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,180
situation it's it's somewhat rare that

79
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,860
we get to pick a lock so I'm gonna share

80
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,230
the five techniques we're gonna start

81
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,489
with technique number one which is make

82
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:07,560
some friends this we're going to exploit

83
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,620
people instead of the actual mechanism

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,140
these people specifically the cleaning

85
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,820
crews in buildings are almost always

86
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,429
independent contractors they do not work

87
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,260
for the company that leases the building

88
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,910
and they don't have a lot of security

89
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,820
training so they don't really care that

90
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,340
much when someone who is nicely dressed

91
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,470
and has a briefcase and a name badge

92
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,810
comes up to the door and and gently

93
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,820
knocks and goes I forgot something can

94
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,020
you let me in real quick and get their

95
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,640
grubby little hands all over the

96
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,050
documents they want so I'm gonna

97
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,640
illustrate these five techniques with

98
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,290
one engagement I did where I got to use

99
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,410
all five of these techniques it was a

100
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,390
bank job it was four branches we were

101
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,850
contracted to break into four branches

102
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,010
and one headquarters and once we had

103
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,390
broke into the first branch we more or

104
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,690
less at one we're on the internal

105
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,339
network

106
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,280
we had sensitive documents and all that

107
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,590
kind of stuff but I was with one of the

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,360
newer guys to the company and I also am

109
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,250
just a hooligan and I want to just keep

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,019
going and going and going so once that

111
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,280
first night was done then it was like

112
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,080
playtime and I'm like okay let's just

113
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,180
hit the checkboxes on every single one

114
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,250
of these so number one

115
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,079
got in was the cleaning crew it was

116
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,329
Monday night it was a two-week

117
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,880
engagement Monday night rolls around and

118
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:20,310
about five or six pm I hop in my car

119
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,108
with my partner in crime and we get some

120
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,030
snacks and we get you know some some

121
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,530
water and drinks and we camp out on the

122
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,650
hill with some binoculars and we just

123
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,419
watch the bank branch that we were

124
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,609
tasked with breaking into now I'm

125
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,400
looking for is a what time does cleaning

126
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,370
through crumb be one of they were they

127
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,320
wearing do they lock the door behind

128
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,849
them do they prop the door open what

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
doors are they exiting and entering from

130
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,419
is there a bush I can go hide any can I

131
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,370
put a ghillie suit on and just like hide

132
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,109
next to the door and as soon as they go

133
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,550
in can I just sneak on in because the

134
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,960
whole point is just to get in there as

135
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,070
soon as the cleaning crew opens that

136
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,419
door you know it's not going to be

137
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,800
alarmed there's not going to be a sound

138
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,650
alarm going off the cleaning crews

139
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,560
opening that door it's extremely safe to

140
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,739
tailgate or otherwise trick these people

141
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,750
into letting you in now what I did

142
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,270
Monday night we scouted it out about

143
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,370
7:00 p.m. a single guy comes in there

144
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,630
and he opens up the door and then he

145
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,919
locks it behind him and he starts

146
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,680
cleaning he looked like a very nice man

147
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,780
he was also clearly not employed by the

148
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,639
bank he was employed by this third party

149
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,260
contractor service so that's good too

150
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,150
because now he's not gonna know whether

151
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,280
my fake outfit and and all that is

152
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,320
actually accurate so I get my suit on

153
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,750
Tuesday night rolls around get my suit

154
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,510
on 6:00 p.m. I've got my fake name badge

155
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,539
I harvested the bank's Twitter account

156
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,009
and found some new hire photos and they

157
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,729
had their little name badge right there

158
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:43,889
so as Silas like a slight side note as

159
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,099
we were trying to get these badges I

160
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,680
went to a batch making service and I

161
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:52,860
said hey can I get this badge that says

162
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,650
like chief of IT operations or whatever

163
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,419
for XYZ bank and they're like they look

164
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,250
at me a little suspiciously they're like

165
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:00,810
okay all right and they leave for like

166
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,310
15 minutes and I'm just sitting there

167
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,590
like this this is probably not good

168
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,699
right I don't really have like how am I

169
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,250
gonna convince these people and I'm

170
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,780
actually here for good so about 15-20

171
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,180
minutes later they roll back into the

172
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,669
into the office and they say come with

173
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,080
me real quick and I'm like crap so I

174
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,500
start walking you know doing the walk of

175
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,539
shame to their office she closes the

176
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,920
door and locks it behind her and I'm

177
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,600
like first of all I don't think that is

178
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,820
like the safest way of going about this

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,950
if I was a real criminal but as soon as

180
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,450
I saw that I knew that she suspected

181
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,539
something was amiss

182
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,719
apparently meth heads do this a lot I

183
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,640
had no idea but they were in a they were

184
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,930
like an industrial sign supply company

185
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,340
and they made a lot of badges and stuff

186
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,720
and so I wanted to get this fake badge

187
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,789
and apparently people come in try and

188
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,200
get fake badges like pretty commonly and

189
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,360
they're usually trying to get drugs out

190
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,580
of it somehow so she's like grilling me

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,560
in that room and I give her the contact

192
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,640
information for the one guy at the bank

193
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,890
they knew I was doing the job and and

194
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,510
she he settles her down and everything

195
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,210
and I'm thinking about how to circumvent

196
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:00,200
this process and honestly I just gave

197
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,120
her essentially my letter of

198
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,289
authorization and I gave her a phone

199
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,900
number and she called the phone number

200
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,730
the guy says yeah I hired this guy to

201
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,049
break into my bank and then she's like

202
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,600
okay great and she brings me my badges

203
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,830
so I'm sitting there thinking well maybe

204
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,600
there's a missing step here you're

205
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,010
locking me in the room you're not really

206
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,690
verifying anything it doesn't matter

207
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,340
because I got my badge so I put my badge

208
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,650
on and I head down to the bank ranch I

209
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,440
got my briefcase on and the key is to

210
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,390
look as unthreatening as possible so I

211
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,830
Drive my car up to the front door I

212
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,419
parked my car right in front of the

213
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,210
front door I get out with my briefcase

214
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,430
my suit on and a cover you know happy

215
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,810
dumb looking grin come up to the door

216
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,510
like look around a little bit little

217
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,610
half-smile on knock gently wave real

218
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,110
friendly and as soon as he opens the

219
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,729
door he just cracks it a little bit and

220
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,000
it's like hey what's uh what's going on

221
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,979
here and I'm like I just forgot my brief

222
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,570
get some documents I have to get us out

223
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:51,830
before 7 p.m. is there a chance you

224
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,300
could just let me in for a split second

225
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm gonna run in there I'm gonna grab my

226
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,450
stuff and I'll get out of your hair and

227
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,250
he's like yeah of course of course and

228
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,020
you just opens the door and now I'm in

229
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,190
now I'm doing Network drops now I'm

230
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,500
taking pictures of sensitive information

231
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,570
the the one time that we could pick

232
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,190
locks in this case was for file cabinets

233
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,870
they allow us to pick file cabinet locks

234
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,520
file cabinet locks are extremely easy to

235
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,530
pick and thanks to think that's file

236
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,330
cabinet locks are like safes there they

237
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,469
are nothing like safes so as soon as I

238
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,169
got into the manager's office I'm

239
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:22,100
picking all over her wafer locks on her

240
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,080
on her file cabinets open and there's

241
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,330
just you know I mean there's famous

242
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,840
people's financial documents and stuff

243
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,340
it was like an MVP client list so I just

244
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,990
had all of their taxes

245
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,459
everything so I'm feeling good about

246
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,100
this I'm feeling like this is gonna be a

247
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,120
good week I'm gonna have a good time

248
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,740
we're pretty much done I mean we had

249
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,510
network access we can we can do it

250
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,330
everyone at this point now we can just

251
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:49,280
start breaking into all the other places

252
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:51,200
just for fun and giggles technique

253
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,750
number two this was the second bank

254
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,030
branch we broke into this is the Hall

255
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:00,020
Pass and the hall pass it's my bag

256
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,520
it looks like this this is a Hall Pass I

257
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,490
like to call this thing the key to the

258
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,860
city because this thing is amazing so

259
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,390
when you look at a door latch this is

260
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,490
the most common thing you'll see it's

261
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,880
sort of a d' shape like a curved e shape

262
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,370
and a flat back when you lock this door

263
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,080
you are not locking that latch in place

264
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,810
you're locking the door handle in place

265
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,640
this latch can still move freely so when

266
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,400
you shut the door and you lock the door

267
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,270
what you can do is just take this thing

268
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,400
hook the latch and then just pull it out

269
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,860
and that forces the latch to go in and

270
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,270
now you're inside the door this this is

271
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,000
amazing so this is actually a really

272
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,530
really good tool for getting into

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,840
rooftops I'm a big fan of going to

274
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,400
rooftops whether you're technically

275
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,690
allowed to or not and when you're not

276
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,199
allowed and that door is locked

277
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:50,600
this thing almost always gets you in now

278
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,740
there's a few caveats to this it's not

279
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,090
or a few different tricks let me show

280
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,120
you how it works real quick just it'll

281
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:59,420
make it easier because it's easier to

282
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,680
see than it is to explain so you see you

283
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,120
just slide it between the frame of the

284
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,650
door you hook the latch and then just

285
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,290
tilt it up and it reaches behind and

286
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:15,500
pulls on this until it slides in and

287
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:18,589
enables you to exit now this video makes

288
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,510
it look super easy and it half a time it

289
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,280
is that easy you literally just swipe it

290
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,780
there's a couple tricks though that you

291
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:29,300
got to know if you're gonna be doing

292
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:33,470
this professionally one trick is when

293
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,689
the door latch is really in there tight

294
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,790
so the the tolerances on the door latch

295
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,700
are really good and the door frame is

296
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,380
real tight on that door latch you're not

297
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,670
gonna be able to just slide it and pull

298
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,350
you're gonna have to put a lot of force

299
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,170
into it which is why I have a carry a

300
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,940
metal one what you can do the trick here

301
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,290
is to take off your shoe you hook the

302
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,840
latch you take off your shoe you get

303
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,480
underneath it and you jam straight up

304
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,720
that gets you a ton of leverage against

305
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,320
a really tight latch that will let you

306
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,810
get into a lot of these doors the second

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,940
trick here is if there's a door guard

308
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,020
people are sometimes getting smart to

309
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,300
this and they'll put this little door

310
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,250
guard on the door and this was supposed

311
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,069
to prevent exactly what we're doing the

312
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,230
Hall Pass attack however Justin Wynne

313
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,660
had a good story about this one there's

314
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,940
two ways to bypass this number one is a

315
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,800
shoelace you can take your shoelace and

316
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,240
you can just thread it from the top all

317
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,099
the way down to the bottom making sure

318
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,510
you're behind the latch and then just

319
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,160
put your foot against the frame and just

320
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:35,300
jerk it all open well that's my go-to

321
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,620
that's not always gonna be possible

322
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,170
though because sometimes door frames

323
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,310
have these weird like angles in them do

324
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,689
you gotta take like the right angle and

325
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,670
a left and right and left and right and

326
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,140
got to go around this kind of maze to

327
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:50,510
reach the latch in order to bypass that

328
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,740
Justin win and actually the his friend

329
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,590
that he was doing the engagement with

330
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,210
that also got arrested made a kind of a

331
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,830
clever technique that I've never seen or

332
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,110
heard anyone else doing I'm not sure if

333
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,750
they made this up themselves or if it

334
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,450
was something that you know they picked

335
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,730
up on the way but these are your best

336
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:12,350
friend these are dollar cutting boards

337
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:15,110
on Amazon they are stiff but flexible so

338
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:17,210
what you can do is cut this notch into

339
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,800
the side of one of those cutting boards

340
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,010
or the corner of one of those cutting

341
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,569
boards cut that notch in there and that

342
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:29,810
thing is just the perfect amount of

343
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,820
flexible and stiff to go around all the

344
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,310
little edges and the trick though is to

345
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,140
put it in corner side first you want a

346
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,060
jam a corner in kind of slide it down a

347
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,740
little bit and then start working it up

348
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,270
and down as you work it in that's the

349
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,010
trick with these things so they're doing

350
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:48,500
that and they're doing this against a

351
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:50,960
very famous museum I guess I'll say it's

352
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,520
about 1:00 a.m. as usual and they can't

353
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,990
get into this building it's uh it was it

354
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,340
was very tricky social engineering

355
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,060
wasn't working the security is quite

356
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,350
good but it found us

357
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,670
side door and the side door did not

358
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,280
appear to have a lot of security on it

359
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,390
it did however have a door latch so

360
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,220
they're thinking okay this is our target

361
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,380
this is the softest spot though of the

362
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,430
exterior of this really famous Museum so

363
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,410
what they did is they ordered these on

364
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,199
Amazon overnight shipped them cut the

365
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,640
notch in and 1:00 a.m. they they go back

366
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,100
to that door and they start sliding

367
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,380
around and the security footage of this

368
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,020
is some of the greatest TV I have ever

369
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,900
seen what you see in this grainy TV

370
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,550
image you see it's from the inside the

371
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,319
cameras on the inside facing pointing

372
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,550
out this door entrance there on the

373
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,440
outside and they're they're wiggling

374
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,140
this thing so you see on the camera all

375
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,460
is still and quiet and all of a sudden

376
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,770
you see this little piece of plastic

377
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,080
start wiggling its way inside the

378
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,750
doorframe just going up and down slowly

379
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,790
but surely and then you see that janitor

380
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:46,280
coming to frame and the janitor is

381
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:50,630
looking at this thing for a solid 15

382
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:56,170
seconds or so before he finally knocks

383
00:13:50,630 --> 00:14:07,910
on the door and you see in the yellow

384
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:10,400
stop slowly actually got in through that

385
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,160
method or not but that camera for that

386
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,660
just cracked me up so the two texts are

387
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,000
of three techniques this was one

388
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,100
technique with two different tricks that

389
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,300
you can do the whole process is the

390
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,850
simple one if it's a real easy one you

391
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,870
just slide it if you have a door blocker

392
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:29,330
like this you use either a shoelace or a

393
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,950
piece of plastic so those are two tricks

394
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,470
that I don't think are very well known

395
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,330
but work really well for breaking into

396
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,650
buildings one thing to note about this

397
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,080
is that the Hall Pass generally won't

398
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,449
get you past exterior security sometimes

399
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,500
it will but most of the time X you're

400
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,570
going to use the hall pass on the

401
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,700
interior of the building so for doors

402
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,590
that have like RFID card readers and

403
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,990
stuff for sensitive areas in the finance

404
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,310
sector and stuff like that you're not

405
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,400
gonna see a lot of doors that are

406
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,270
vulnerable to this maybe maybe 20% of

407
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,770
the time something like that it's hard

408
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,449
to put percentages on here but in my

409
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,920
experience about 20% of time on the

410
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,420
inside though these things get you

411
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,880
everywhere absolutely everywhere and

412
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,170
rooftops - man you've not had a good

413
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,400
date until you brought a girl up to a

414
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,709
rooftop who did not know that she was

415
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,310
going up to a rooftop

416
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,589
technique number three is the breaker

417
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,209
bar breakin now I see this lesson Europe

418
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:19,210
but I do still see him here but these

419
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:22,360
are everywhere in America these double

420
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,830
doors I love love love seeing these

421
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,450
double doors these double doors mean

422
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,490
it's probably going to be an easy

423
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,870
engagement there's at least three

424
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,910
different methods of breaking into these

425
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:37,060
doors let's talk about the easiest one

426
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,860
this is a breaker bar these will open

427
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,689
the door even if it's locked from the

428
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,130
inside so the whole point of this is to

429
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,350
make sure that if someone is trapped in

430
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:45,850
a fire they can just run up this door

431
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:47,380
and just slam it like a linebacker and

432
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,740
it'll open up even if it's been locked

433
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:55,380
previously now this leaves a giant

434
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:58,000
gaping security hole because of this our

435
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,920
tool works exactly the same you slide it

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,050
in through the crack between the doors

437
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,420
you can kind of feel around and you can

438
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,760
find out exactly where that bar is and

439
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,079
once you do you pull and you get that

440
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,270
bolt to retract too easy that's it

441
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,580
whatever you see one of these doors that

442
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:18,310
technique is gonna work most of the time

443
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,170
alone it's very very rare that you'll

444
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,479
see tolerances between those two doors

445
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,060
that's small that's tight enough that

446
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,589
you can't fit something in there and you

447
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,880
don't have to use this tool specifically

448
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:33,160
the one he's using here this term here

449
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,510
is a Sparrow's tool I actually am NOT a

450
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,560
huge fan of this tool because it's a

451
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,550
little bit thicker than it has to be

452
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,989
because it's got like a rubberized

453
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:39,520
coating on it I guess for grip or

454
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,500
something but it's for me in the past

455
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,750
because it's a little too thick you can

456
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,000
use pretty much any piece of thin metal

457
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:49,089
though you can just go to Lowe's go to

458
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,040
their like metal bar aisle and then just

459
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,110
get one of those really tiny metal bars

460
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,060
and just bend it into an L shape shove

461
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,270
that between the door turn it open the

462
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:01,750
door right up that is it now the there

463
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:03,160
is a trick to this one too you'll see on

464
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,319
the bottom of this tool there's that

465
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,790
little little notch in the bottom I

466
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,438
don't know if you can see it here it's

467
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:12,000
right in the very bottom it's a little

468
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,040
u-shape the little U shape is for a

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,819
secondary method of getting into these

470
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,740
doors if it's dead bolted you're not

471
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:22,089
going to be able to hit the breaker bar

472
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,480
and open it up the dead ball is going to

473
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,029
stop you

474
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,889
but you can still slide that tool

475
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:28,600
through the double doors and then hit

476
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:29,979
that deadbolt latch that little latch

477
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,490
right there is always gonna be on the

478
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,710
inside and it's usually not a key most

479
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,000
of the time if it's if it is a key and

480
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,440
it's a dead-bolted you're gonna have to

481
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,779
pick it there's not really a way around

482
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,250
that but most the time it's not going to

483
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:43,510
key it's gonna be a hand latch because

484
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,159
again they want people to be able to

485
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,720
escape and then in the case it'll fire

486
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,700
so what you can do is you shove that

487
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,279
tool between the two double doors and

488
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:57,429
then you just use that little that

489
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:59,620
little thing at the end of this that

490
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:00,909
little notch u-shaped thing at the

491
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,979
bottom of that you can use that to hook

492
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:06,460
the latch for the deadbolt and then just

493
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,110
flip the latch open so these doors are

494
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:12,669
your best friend these things are

495
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,408
amazing and this was oh you know what I

496
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,299
didn't tell you about how I got into the

497
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:16,929
bank for this last one I'm gonna back up

498
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,668
real quick

499
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,440
so we used one of these break branches

500
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:25,120
had exactly this and how did this door

501
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,039
jamb here and I just used a shoelace the

502
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,899
shoelace worked perfectly slid it over

503
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,950
the top put the foot yeah that story

504
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,779
wasn't even worth going back for alright

505
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,340
so moving into the breaker bars the

506
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:34,720
headquarters building though this is

507
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,090
where we use the bread the the double

508
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,200
doors the headquarters building most

509
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,250
headquarters buildings are gonna have

510
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,230
these large double doors because

511
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,610
companies need to get big carts through

512
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,380
these doors they need to get like big

513
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,510
objects through it's almost never gonna

514
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,190
be a single door now in order to get

515
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:53,769
into the headquarters building I did in

516
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,059
fact use this technique number four to

517
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:57,669
get into the bank branch

518
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,610
I used the sparrows tool so the sparrows

519
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,840
tool had I couldn't use the sparrows

520
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,428
tool because it was too thick to get

521
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,689
into the bank branch so on what I was

522
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,950
doing was exactly I said earlier when I

523
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,299
went to Lowe's I found a piece of metal

524
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,529
I just bent it through an l-shape put it

525
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,210
through the door and then flipped the

526
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:13,240
deadbolt latch that opens me right up

527
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,100
into this Bank and first you may be

528
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,769
asking what about in the case of alarms

529
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,209
and Justin would say yes alarms are

530
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,720
scary and they will get you arrested

531
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,909
in my experience sound alarms are really

532
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,429
uncommon they're just exceptionally

533
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:28,779
uncommon and secondarily if you're going

534
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:30,130
into a place that's secure enough that

535
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:33,220
you think it might have a silent alarm

536
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,730
like a bank you're gonna just want to be

537
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:39,720
in now as fast as possible it

538
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,540
take long to do damage as a bad actor in

539
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,870
a bank or one of these buildings you're

540
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,389
talking three minutes

541
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,739
pop so if you jump in there you trip the

542
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,600
alarm and then you just throw your

543
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,190
network jack into the wall so now you

544
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,990
have remote access into their network

545
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,930
well you now have the crown jewels I

546
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,880
mean you can start using responder and

547
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,920
capturing password hashes or spread

548
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,390
around the network that way so all you

549
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,530
need is a couple minutes in the building

550
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,940
and then you get the hell out the cops

551
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,770
are gonna take at least a few minutes

552
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,990
and even if the cops show up

553
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,550
you still the option of running but

554
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,500
working on the treadmill is pretty

555
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,780
important as a pen tester I have had to

556
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,030
run quite long distances including from

557
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,110
armed guards and it has really paid off

558
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,340
to to be at least in somewhat good shape

559
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,590
so one of the bank branches we just

560
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,760
popped that latch and got right in they

561
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,050
didn't have a son on the LARM you can

562
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,940
check for those alarms there's usually a

563
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,610
magnetic connector on the top of the

564
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,500
door or somewhere around the door frame

565
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,459
so we real quick just scan that to make

566
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,560
sure there's no electronics in the

567
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,850
doorframe make sure there was no saddled

568
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,830
alarm then just what the town you know

569
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,840
eating their snack food and fighting off

570
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,070
for good stuff

571
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,139
now the third technique is what we use

572
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,639
for the headquarters building and that

573
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,010
is the canned air trick I love this

574
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,130
trick it is highly highly effective it

575
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:55,890
takes advantage of this thing

576
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,690
this is a Rex sensor a request to exit

577
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,340
sensor I actually noticed this building

578
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,290
has one of these in the main doors I

579
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,760
didn't know how common these were in

580
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,030
Europe because I have only done a couple

581
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,740
gigs here but I have seen them in a lot

582
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,120
of buildings in the past couple days so

583
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,250
I do think that this is going to be a

584
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,780
somewhat universal one these are

585
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,390
everywhere in America because of fire

586
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:16,860
code fire code says when there's a fire

587
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,580
you have to be able to escape even the

588
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,060
doors are locked

589
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,129
so what this is is it measures heat and

590
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,050
motion this is gonna be on the inside of

591
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,670
the door not on the outside so that if

592
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,389
someone's running towards the door the

593
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,010
doors are locked

594
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,590
this thing will unlock the door because

595
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,430
it notice motion and temperature change

596
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,550
it's actually not heat its temperature

597
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:38,550
change which we are going to exploit

598
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:40,200
using one of these a canned air keyboard

599
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,750
cleaner these things are really great

600
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,460
because check out what happens when you

601
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,460
turn them upside down and spray them

602
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,360
- 46 degrees Celsius - 49 Celsius that's

603
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,370
fantastic that's a huge temperature

604
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,959
change and you can see that it makes a

605
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,030
big cloud when you just spray this up

606
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,130
right it's just it just like see-through

607
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,379
air and doesn't help anybody turn it

608
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,830
upside down though and now you have this

609
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:11,410
massive cloud of coldness coming through

610
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,970
the door so this is the easiest way of

611
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,040
taking advantage of Rex sensors you just

612
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,530
put that little that little uh little

613
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,270
tube that it comes with it's super super

614
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,550
narrow you shove it between the two

615
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,800
doors turn it upside down spray it pops

616
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,570
right open this is a Bank headquarters I

617
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,730
just walk up to the door in a suit and

618
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,010
tie spray it and I'm in a bank

619
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,320
headquarters this stuff works flawlessly

620
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:36,430
I love this trick I always have canned

621
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,010
air on me just in case just like I have

622
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,630
the hall pass on me just in case but

623
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,800
there's actually some variations to this

624
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:48,250
one more the variations because you only

625
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,899
need to have heat a change in

626
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,610
temperature and motion there's an

627
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,980
enormous amount of things you can do to

628
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,360
shove into or under or around that door

629
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,620
that creates a temperature change of

630
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,620
motion - check this one out

631
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,970
so verlox but there's a rack sensor up

632
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,970
there

633
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,059
you can heat things up in your mouth and

634
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,830
spit them out as long as they're not

635
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:25,010
perfectly clear I think you can even use

636
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:28,580
water so one of my co-workers had to get

637
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,500
into a data center and he didn't it was

638
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,669
about 4 a.m. no stores were open there

639
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,140
middle like nowhere I don't know

640
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:35,150
Nebraska Iowa someone like the Midwest

641
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,700
or something and this was a highly

642
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,820
secure data center but one of these side

643
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,520
doors was these was I'm sorry he got

644
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,379
inside because a window was installed

645
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,520
backwards so he just unscrewed the

646
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,140
window and removed it and popped in

647
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,480
there and then once he was inside he had

648
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,880
to get to this secured data center like

649
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,620
headquarters headquarters place the like

650
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,660
the main room that houses all the secure

651
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,570
servers and in order to do that they had

652
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:02,270
a wreck sensor behind the door and the

653
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,290
door was RFID and locked and he I don't

654
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,200
think he was loud to pick it or anything

655
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,610
like that but it's 4 a.m. and there's

656
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,470
there's nothing open you can't just go

657
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,309
to Lowe's like he wasn't quite prepared

658
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:18,710
for this so what's open to 4 a.m. is sex

659
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:20,570
shops so he got a blow-up doll and just

660
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,100
unrolled it shoved it underneath the

661
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,780
door and then started blowing it up and

662
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,580
then waving it around so the heat from

663
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:30,070
his breath warmed her up and she in turn

664
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,449
thanked him by opening the door for him

665
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,799
so there's a lot of variations on all

666
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,120
days once you know like the fundamental

667
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:37,700
tenets of why these security measures

668
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,520
work there's you can get really creative

669
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,140
with how you bypass them you could pee

670
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,510
through the door I've heard of that

671
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,270
working quite well if you have no other

672
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,940
options you can just shoot a stream in

673
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:54,950
there it's warm and it changes the

674
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:56,720
motion the fifth technique is going to

675
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,250
be sliding underneath the door if

676
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,610
there's enough of a gap then you can

677
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,610
just do this

678
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,770
most the time there's not gonna be

679
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,090
enough of a gap and when there's not

680
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,980
enough of a gap we're gonna take

681
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,350
advantage of these door handles now I do

682
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,570
notice these a lot less in Europe this

683
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,449
is an a door handle that conforms to

684
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,950
Americans with Disabilities Act this is

685
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,480
an app that says that you know that's

686
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,860
the app that put the parking spaces all

687
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,810
over the place for the handicapped cars

688
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,449
it's the act that says don't

689
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:28,460
have to be accessible for people with

690
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,020
handicaps who can't grip strongly or

691
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,330
anything like that so they had they made

692
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,670
them look like this because this is much

693
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,280
easier for someone with who's missing a

694
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,020
hand or something to open the door more

695
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,730
so than those circular doorknobs that I

696
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,850
see all over the place especially in

697
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,170
Europe what's something like that for

698
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,120
those those are gonna be a lot harder to

699
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,860
do this trick on probably still possible

700
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,600
but hard you're going to take advantage

701
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,439
of these and didn't take advantage them

702
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,730
with this piece of metal fishing rod

703
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,490
it's very difficult to explain how this

704
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,460
works and this picture does not tell you

705
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,630
any clues about you know what you're

706
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:06,710
supposed to do with this so let's take a

707
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:09,050
look at a real quick video you slide it

708
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:13,550
under the door will you hold on to that

709
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:15,530
metal ring you pull both the draw string

710
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,780
and the tool and if the door opens away

711
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:20,690
from you not only do you pull the tool

712
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:22,070
but you gotta push with your head yeah

713
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,200
that's it you just slide it underneath

714
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,480
you're holding on to that little loop on

715
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,650
the bottom one hands up on the metal

716
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,110
loop on the bottom and the other hand is

717
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,490
in that ring and you slide it under you

718
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,919
lift it up you put your ear to the door

719
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,840
you listen for words scraping you get it

720
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,030
right on the door handle and then you

721
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,429
just pull that loop pull that that

722
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,870
little metal string and that makes it

723
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:46,250
flex causes the door handle to turn and

724
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,770
you're in so this is another one of

725
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,560
these techniques that is less likely to

726
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:53,180
get you in from the X from the outside

727
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,889
of the building but it will get you

728
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,540
everywhere once you're inside the

729
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,490
building this this one actually gets me

730
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,170
much farther on the inside of buildings

731
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,970
and the Hall Pass does because sometimes

732
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,410
there's special latches that have

733
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,910
preventative measures for the hall pass

734
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,650
like it's like a double latch that

735
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,200
prevents the hall pass from working but

736
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:12,290
this thing works amazingly all over it's

737
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,150
so hard to fix this problem because the

738
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,080
gaps underneath these doors I mean what

739
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,690
are you going to do you're gonna make it

740
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,280
harder for the door to open to make it

741
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,930
that door secure from this attack

742
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,490
because you have to have incredibly

743
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,620
tight tolerances now think about there's

744
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,360
carpet if there's carpet what are you

745
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,590
gonna do a piece of metal down there and

746
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,540
now everyone opens the door that

747
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:31,220
everyone jerk it open no one is going to

748
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,990
sacrifice convenience for security I

749
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,350
feel like we've learned that already so

750
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,780
this is an

751
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,760
extremely extremely hard one for a

752
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,230
company to fix there's a variation on

753
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,210
this one too let's say they do fix it

754
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,250
let's say it's a metal floor and there's

755
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,690
a metal piece of metal on the bottom of

756
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,760
the door prevents anything from getting

757
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,370
underneath hotels are actually quite

758
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,740
good at this hotels are especially in

759
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,320
America are very good at having tight

760
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,950
tight tolerances between the bottom of

761
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,620
their door and the floor well you can

762
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,250
just go above it in that case what you

763
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:07,280
can do is take 35 millimeter film make a

764
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,260
loop out of it it's thin and it's strong

765
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,389
so you can just slide it up through the

766
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,799
top or through the side of the door if

767
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,659
you think that's gonna work but I think

768
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,100
the top usually works better slide it

769
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,600
through and this is much harder because

770
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,620
it's hard to tell where the loop is on

771
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,580
the other side of the door that's

772
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,100
compared to having a piece of metal

773
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,750
scraping or even hear it but you take

774
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,799
that loop and you just keep feeding it

775
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,690
and feeding it until you feel like

776
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,158
you're about at the door handle you hook

777
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,100
the door handle you pull down on that

778
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,020
film now you've just bypassed what I

779
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:38,870
know as the only protection against this

780
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:42,500
attack the k22 is what that's called ok

781
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,149
so that was the those were the five

782
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:48,169
educational techniques how much time do

783
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,370
I have half an hour so I'm just gonna

784
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,429
tell you some stories now at this point

785
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,570
this here's where the tales come in

786
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:55,880
because those techniques aren't always

787
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,500
going to work those will work the large

788
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,240
majority of the cases but sometimes

789
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,179
sometimes you're breaking into something

790
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,520
really secure so one time we were tasked

791
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,960
me and Justin Winn actually we're tasked

792
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,450
with breaking into one of the most

793
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,150
expensive skyscrapers in New York City

794
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:13,059
it was right on right in the middle of

795
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,710
Manhattan

796
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,230
really beautiful views absolutely

797
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,240
gorgeous place we were tasked by one of

798
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,330
the employees or one of the company's

799
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,809
leasing a floor on that skyscraper to

800
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,039
break into their place we knew this was

801
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:31,070
gonna be really hard because New York

802
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:32,658
has very tight security in order to get

803
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,490
into this building there's four

804
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:36,530
entrances there were the only four

805
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,140
entrances we could find I circled this

806
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,408
place a million times four entrances all

807
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,000
four entrance have a guard and gating by

808
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:46,410
passing guards usually requires some

809
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,760
kind of deep social engineering you

810
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,230
not gonna be able to like just walk in

811
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,970
with your burglary set in your backpack

812
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,530
and then spill some coffee on the ground

813
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,000
and then just like sprint you're gonna

814
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,290
have to probably figure out a trick to

815
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,090
get by those guards I don't like dealing

816
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,220
with guards anytime I get the

817
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:01,409
opportunity I'm breaking in after hours

818
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm not dealing with human beings I'm

819
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,700
gonna use one of those techniques other

820
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,900
than the cleaning crew and I'm just

821
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,160
gonna try and break in so I've all the

822
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,170
time in the world I don't have to trick

823
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,510
anybody because some people are very

824
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,310
suspicious it's much easier to bypass

825
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,190
physical security mechanisms than it is

826
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,350
mental ones most of the time so what we

827
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:23,520
did is we call up the company that owns

828
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:26,399
this building we pretended to be from a

829
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,230
major healthcare organization from their

830
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,900
research team and we were pretending to

831
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:33,180
be like a small group of Harvard grads

832
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,440
who this research team had invested all

833
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,420
this money in that's why we were so

834
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,860
young but you know a little young

835
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,780
researcher geniuses and we were gonna

836
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:45,659
get a really swanky office in this this

837
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:48,120
New York skyscraper so we had to cover

838
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,290
for the fact that we were young because

839
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,250
most the people in that building are

840
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,120
gonna be a little bit older or they

841
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,700
would be in the finance world and

842
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,929
everything so I call him up and I spoke

843
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,030
to my first billionaire one of the

844
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,040
owners of the company he talked just

845
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,899
like a billionaire he said about three

846
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,399
words told me to get the hell off his

847
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,290
phone and call us out a guy he's nothing

848
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,360
to do with this so I get off I call you

849
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,129
a guy and he schedules me for a real

850
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,169
estate tour we get up the real estate

851
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,250
tour me and when our you know we're

852
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,930
decked out in our suits and everything

853
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,640
pretending to be like little young

854
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,110
geniuses little Silicon Valley geniuses

855
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,700
that this healthcare company had given

856
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,750
us millions and millions of millions of

857
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,880
dollars for so we could afford this

858
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,370
place and Justin gets a little tummy

859
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,780
ache he went up on the 50th floor or

860
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,040
something and we're just taking pictures

861
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,780
of the views and all that kind of stuff

862
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,040
and Justin's like I mean I ate some bad

863
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,379
chicken or something on that street

864
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,110
vendor outside do you mind if I go check

865
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,880
out a restroom and the guy the tour

866
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,679
agent who got us right past the guards

867
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,060
he just says you know like waves of the

868
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,200
guard the guard he knows him so we

869
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,510
bypassed the guards that way take the

870
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,970
elevator up he says yeah of course like

871
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:47,070
there's a bathroom down that like one

872
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,270
floor or something and wins like oh my

873
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,830
god no I think I'm gonna throw up I'm

874
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:51,360
just gonna head out or I'm only I'm a

875
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,189
two minute walk from this place I'm just

876
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,229
I gotta bounce Dan can you take care of

877
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,210
this and I'm like of course I can yeah

878
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,710
so he bounces out and what he actually

879
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,929
does is goes down to floor so he goes

880
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:02,779
down two floors two

881
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,970
an empty floor if we thought it was

882
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,080
empty I should say but it's it looks

883
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,580
like it's under construction there's

884
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,899
like no carpet there's there's no

885
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,580
offices nothing like that

886
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:11,899
so he ends up going to the bathroom but

887
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,009
the men's bathroom was locked the

888
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,779
women's bathroom was the only one that

889
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:16,249
was unlocked we assume this has had

890
00:32:14,779 --> 00:32:18,049
something to do with construction who

891
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,850
knows why he goes in there and he sits

892
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:21,830
down and he's just chilling there for

893
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,199
like half an hour I bounced out of there

894
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,519
I go home I'm having sushi I'm having a

895
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,389
good time and he's still stuck up there

896
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,799
so what happens is the door opens to the

897
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:35,658
bathroom after about an hour of waiting

898
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,658
and he sees two women's feet walk into

899
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,860
the bathroom pointing right at his stall

900
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,149
that he's sitting in and then

901
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,418
immediately turn around and leave and

902
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:46,668
he's like oh crap he's got big old man

903
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,230
feet so I have the feeling that those

904
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:49,820
women could tell that that was not

905
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,570
another woman in that stall and they

906
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:55,610
call security security comes up they go

907
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,689
like they knock on all the doors like

908
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,918
all the stalls and stuff and at first

909
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,600
he's just being quiet because he doesn't

910
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,399
want to give himself away or anything

911
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,928
but eventually he realizes that there's

912
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,428
no getting out of this one so the

913
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:05,570
security knocks on the doors and he goes

914
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:07,249
oh I'm so sorry I just have a

915
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,090
stomachache like I I had to run down

916
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,409
here from I'm on a tour upstairs I had

917
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:14,029
to go down here I'm so embarrassed like

918
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,259
I just if you give me ten minutes I will

919
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:17,419
be out of your hair out of this whole

920
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:19,129
place and the security guards apparently

921
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:20,990
thought that was good enough and they

922
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,039
were like all right so he waits for them

923
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,509
to get to the elevator

924
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,549
he hears the elevator doors shut and

925
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:27,139
leave and their mistake was leaving they

926
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:28,999
should have somebody should have waited

927
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,860
there with him I mean it's a man in a

928
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:34,070
woman's bathroom on an empty floor on a

929
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,049
skyscraper like this this is not okay so

930
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,149
that was their mistake he did name-drop

931
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:39,529
the company were working for along with

932
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,629
our point of contact which probably

933
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:43,970
helped because I'm sure the guards know

934
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:45,830
the main people that work and live in

935
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,350
that building so I'm sure that was

936
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,519
useful in that case but he ended up a as

937
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,959
soon as he heard the elevator door

938
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,149
closed he gets out of that bathroom he

939
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,830
runs to the stairwell he runs up this

940
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:56,959
stairwell at the very top of the Hyde's

941
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:59,629
there he has no food no water and it's

942
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,799
like 2:00 p.m. so he can't get food and

943
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:02,240
water I'm trying to sit there and think

944
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,950
of ways I could like check a water

945
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,629
bottle up 50 flights of stairs but I

946
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,789
don't think that was gonna work so he's

947
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,348
stuck there I'm sitting on the outside

948
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:10,940
and watching the lights on the floor

949
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,740
he's on to tell them when they go out

950
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,300
well

951
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,678
funny story they never go out it's New

952
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,450
York and it's a finance sector those

953
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,940
people are working all the time 7 p.m.

954
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,949
rolls around he's like dude I am dying

955
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,050
right now I'm thirsty I have to go to

956
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:25,569
the bathroom but I can't move and I'm

957
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,859
like alright well you know let's just

958
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,240
check us you can go ahead and try and

959
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:29,649
get into their building now I mean it's

960
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,379
7 o'clock they should be going home

961
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:35,560
right it's past 5:00 he's like yeah ok

962
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:37,239
so he gets the hope at the Piquet 22

963
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,679
which is the under the door tool he goes

964
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:41,040
to the stairwell entrance one thing to

965
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:43,418
know in office buildings stairwells are

966
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,940
golden they're absolutely golden

967
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,009
stairwell doors are often the least

968
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,629
secured of any of the doors in that

969
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,940
building so he goes to the stairwell

970
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,889
goes to the floor they're on and he used

971
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,139
it under the door tool just slips

972
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,490
underneath it's an RFID reader door he

973
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:59,770
couldn't Hall pass it I don't think it

974
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,629
was Hall passable so he does the under

975
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:04,240
the door trick opens up that door and

976
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,400
the door opens up into the office so he

977
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,919
has a backpack full of burglary tools

978
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,930
the night vision and and thermal optics

979
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,349
and block picks everything in his

980
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,359
backpack

981
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,849
his backpack also has a big skull and

982
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,380
crossbones on it why he didn't carry a

983
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:19,599
briefcase I'll never know but you know

984
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,790
so he gets in there he turns the corner

985
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,400
from the stairwell into the main portion

986
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:27,640
of this office and he sees about 30

987
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,290
heads whipped to him because it's New

988
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,868
York and it's the finance world they're

989
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,910
still working so he's a pen cam and boy

990
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:35,619
if it was legal I would show you some of

991
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:37,149
this footage because it's gold he's not

992
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:38,589
a pen cam right here he sees all these

993
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:41,380
heads ripped towards him he's in a

994
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:43,570
backpack he's like this doesn't look

995
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,970
like he belongs at all he starts walking

996
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:48,099
and makes a beeline for the door just

997
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:51,180
straight to the door there's a picture

998
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:54,910
of a guy who's staring at him with a

999
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:58,690
expression of horror the entire time

1000
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,129
he's walking by just like this and he

1001
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,930
didn't want any confrontations so he

1002
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,119
bounces out of there he goes back to his

1003
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,649
hiding place up in the stairwell no one

1004
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,030
I mean even if they did try and confront

1005
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:09,130
him he was just gonna walk out anyway

1006
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,630
he's like oh I was just here doing some

1007
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,070
maintenance on on whatever and then he's

1008
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,589
just gonna run like he wasn't gonna let

1009
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,060
anyone prevent him from running running

1010
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,799
is very important you have to see and

1011
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,630
climbing stairs so he gets back to his

1012
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,000
hiding place and he's like oh my god I

1013
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,740
still haven't eaten in like 10 hours and

1014
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,240
I haven't had a sip of water

1015
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,189
but you just gotta ride it out because

1016
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,450
there's no going back now so I'm sitting

1017
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,710
there on the bottom still yeah gonna pop

1018
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,149
in my sushi being like yeah the lights

1019
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,680
are still on

1020
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,210
6:11 p.m. lights are still on it sucks

1021
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,950
to be you

1022
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,869
so 11 p.m. rolls around he's like dude I

1023
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,089
I'm just gonna die if I don't get this

1024
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,380
done so you finally under the door tools

1025
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,020
at this time and now there's no one

1026
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,720
there perfect does the network drop gets

1027
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,740
access and that was how we succeeded on

1028
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,509
a New York skyscraper with guards guards

1029
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,500
the point of that lesson here is that

1030
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,360
guards usually require social

1031
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,770
engineering and to social engineer them

1032
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,450
you take advantage of someone they trust

1033
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,460
in this case that was the leasing agent

1034
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,379
there's always gonna be someone a guard

1035
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,460
trusts that can get you in you generally

1036
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,070
are not gonna be social engineering the

1037
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,330
guard themselves I have seen P a lot of

1038
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,410
people will go into buildings and

1039
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,960
they'll just say hey I'm a printer

1040
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,540
repair tech take me to your printer and

1041
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,720
the guards almost never want any part of

1042
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,550
that

1043
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,529
they'll be like who who's your contact

1044
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,730
here what Who am I supposed to call

1045
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:20,020
about this they always want to call

1046
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,090
somebody so you have to give them

1047
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,460
somebody to call you can do things like

1048
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:27,400
sense fake emails one time outs at a

1049
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,290
bank and I had to break in during office

1050
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,359
hours I wasn't allowed to come in at

1051
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:35,830
night and those are always harder gigs

1052
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,779
so I sent a spoofed email from the

1053
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:39,490
managers account I just used like an

1054
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,050
online form or something you can email

1055
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,000
headers are very easy to spoof so you

1056
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,920
can spoof the two in the from and I knew

1057
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,060
that they were using a crappy email

1058
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,880
program that didn't have good spam

1059
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,869
filtering so I just sent a fake email

1060
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,240
pretending to be from the manager to the

1061
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:54,940
bank manager's office and I also did the

1062
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,939
bank manager had a meeting at at a

1063
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,490
certain time on a certain day because it

1064
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,410
was listed on their website so I sent an

1065
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,500
email saying hey I'm gonna be in this

1066
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,850
meeting from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. I

1067
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,050
have someone coming to work on my

1068
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,490
computer during that time and I sent

1069
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,190
that to the front desk and I send it to

1070
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,270
the front desk right after she left for

1071
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,500
the meeting so there's no way the front

1072
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,790
desk and just turn around and be like oh

1073
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,160
hey you know you could just told me that

1074
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,840
so that's another example of how you

1075
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,770
might get in using social engineering

1076
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,060
rather than one of these physical

1077
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:26,770
security tricks let me tell you what my

1078
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,960
first bank job because that was actually

1079
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,210
that job I just described was the second

1080
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,470
one the first bank job I didn't even

1081
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,540
know the physical security was a part of

1082
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,569
this job I was I was a harder to be a

1083
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,058
networked hacker

1084
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:39,949
and web hacker so they tell me hey you

1085
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:43,279
got to break into this Bank and you have

1086
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:43,609
network access it has to be office hours

1087
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,019
again

1088
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:46,369
I hate these gigs I hate Owens office

1089
00:38:45,019 --> 00:38:48,109
hours only I just don't want to interact

1090
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,809
with these people so office hours roll

1091
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:54,469
around and I go in I have a fake badge

1092
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:56,449
as usual I have a pretext but I go up to

1093
00:38:54,469 --> 00:38:58,009
the bank manager with and this again

1094
00:38:56,449 --> 00:38:59,209
this was one of my earliest gigs so it's

1095
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:00,859
not going to be necessarily the most

1096
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:03,440
sophisticated one but I go and I stand

1097
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:06,348
for my tea I know the VP I know the VP

1098
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,519
of IT I start dropping names John wagon

1099
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,229
blasts it's not his real name obviously

1100
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,279
what John Ragan blast sent me here we're

1101
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:12,049
getting a lot of packet loss between

1102
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:12,890
your branch and the headquarters so if

1103
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:14,150

1104

here at this time and I'm like yeah

1119
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:42,190

I'm already no dumping his passwords uh

1121
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,400
using tools like lasagna from back in

1122
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:49,430
the day steppin all clear text passwords

1123
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,279
from his wife from his uh his Wi-Fi from

1124
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:53,629
his outlook from his web forms all the

1125
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:55,039
kind of stuff so I'm already in great

1126
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,390
shape I can probably get a person at

1127
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,880
this guy when I get home even if he

1128
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,109
kicks me out right there he leaves he

1129
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,849
can't get ahold of John because I came

1130
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:03,109
exactly when John goes to lunch I know

1131
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:05,180
John's never gonna answer his office

1132
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:07,249
phone if he's not in the office he comes

1133
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:10,759

1136
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,529

1137
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,879
necessarily like I don't know if you

1138
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:19,489
have a permission to do this and I'm

1139
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,930
like John really needs these trace

1140
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:23,359
routes I mean he was adamant that he

1141
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:25,129
wanted these very quickly and he's a

1142
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,229
come so sorry I'm so sorry I just want

1143
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,269
to help but just I can't though I just I

1144
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:31,339
can't I'm so sorry but the five minutes

1145
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:33,078
arguing I pretend to get pissed off slam

1146
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:34,849
my laptop closed you know stare at him

1147
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,119
for a minute and then start walking out

1148
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:39,949
as I'm walking out I turn around and I

1149
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:41,390
say listen can I just get a cup of

1150
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:43,579
coffee or something please and he's

1151
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,180
across the break room is right over here

1152
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,460
but

1153
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,109
I'm like alright alright you're a good

1154
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,490
guy you're a good guy he lets me in

1155
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:50,900
there and I immediately start searching

1156
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,189
for any kind of ethernet jacks I can

1157
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:56,359
find anything

1158
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:58,550
printers phones even just refrigerators

1159
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:59,808
sometimes nowadays I'm just scaling the

1160
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,369
walls looking for an Ethernet jack

1161
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:03,319
somewhere so I can plug back in and

1162
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,540
start stealing more stuff because this

1163
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,800
is my first bank job I want to push the

1164
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,960
limits I don't want to just be like hey

1165
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,880
I'm gonna get out of here now he got me

1166
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,380
I mean I succeeded but he got me I'm

1167
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,059
like I want to crawl through the ceiling

1168
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,760
and do some Splinter Cell something

1169
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:19,339
like that so I can't find anything that

1170
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,569
Jack I'm sick about my options like okay

1171
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,828
it's a drop ceiling I can go in the

1172
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:23,240
ceiling there's a bathroom over there I

1173
00:41:21,829 --> 00:41:24,500
can hide in a stall neither of those

1174
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,270
sound like a good idea because they're

1175
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,010
gonna take too long and I'm just gonna

1176
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,559
get caught in the bathroom but the

1177
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:32,480
office is still open and the lights are

1178
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,880
off and it's right around the corner so

1179
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,470
why just go back to the office so I head

1180
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,940
back into the office and I crawl

1181
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,919
underneath the desk the way the desk is

1182
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,180
set up it's facing the door that's got a

1183
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,010
two-inch gap between the bottom of the

1184
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,750
desk and the doorframe so the lights are

1185
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,650
off I know he can't see me because I'm

1186
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,359
behind this like curtain on the desk and

1187
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,339
I go back to town I've got my laptop

1188
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:54,619
underneath the desk just happily hacking

1189
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:56,420
away in the dark green' catched flying

1190
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,700
across my screen and then a couple

1191
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,589
minutes later I see his feet because I

1192
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,089
can only see the top like the bottoms to

1193
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:03,170
the tops of his feet and I see him walk

1194
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:05,150
towards the break room because I've been

1195
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,720
in there for like 15 minutes and you

1196
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,980
know there's no coffee to be had so I

1197
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,819
pray I'm just sitting there my heart is

1198
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,730
pounding

1199
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:15,589
I see the footsteps and I hear him start

1200
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:18,230
coming back and I might just just walk

1201
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:19,520
right by walk right by don't don't look

1202
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,740
in here you can look he would be able to

1203
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,359
see me but he would eventually if he

1204
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,629
walked in he would so I see his feet

1205
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,180
just walk right by and they stop right

1206
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:31,069
in front of the office door and I see

1207
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:36,109
his toes point into the door and I'm

1208
00:42:31,069 --> 00:42:37,819
like wow he takes a couple steps in he

1209
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:40,279
looks under the desk and he sees my

1210
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:43,009
smiling face with greentext flying

1211
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,660
across my screen though and john really

1212
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,120
needs those trace routes and then going

1213
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,140
back to hacking

1214
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:53,069
it couldn't have been more than 60

1215
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:56,109
seconds of him standing over me

1216
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,000
slack-jawed wondering what to do in this

1217
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,950
situation when I was like I can't take

1218
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,550
the pressure anymore I cracked okay I'm

1219
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:07,710
done closed my laptop and this was when

1220
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:10,330
he said or he got a little suspicious so

1221
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:12,640
he looks at me I'm closing my laptop and

1222
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:14,410
look great I got all the stuff and he

1223
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,400
said can I can I see that laptop real

1224
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:16,930
quick I just want to make sure it's

1225
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,420
bitch branded with our company it's like

1226
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:22,089
a you know an issued laptop I'm like

1227
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,010
yeah okay into my laptop he starts

1228
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:27,730
spinning it around like this you know

1229
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:30,250
inspecting it look at the service tab no

1230
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:33,310
gives it back to me I'm like okay I

1231
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:35,590
guess that's it and the only mistake I

1232
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:38,049
made here was on the way out if you

1233
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:40,360
successfully do a social engineering gig

1234
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,830
you don't tell them you were social

1235
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,170
engineering them at the end of that gig

1236
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,150
so I slide that paper across I didn't

1237
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,460
know that I slide the get out of jail

1238
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,580
free card in front of him and I see his

1239
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:53,800
face just the color drains from his face

1240
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,480
he was such a nice guy it really kind of

1241
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,460
ruined the entire engagement so I've

1242
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,890
never done that again now I just leave

1243
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,280
and they can learn next week that I

1244
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:07,799
didn't actually work for that place

1245
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:09,970
let's see what's a much more time with

1246
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,440
15 minutes okay I'm gonna tell a real

1247
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,500
quick one and then I'll take a couple

1248
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,690
questions the water treatment facility

1249
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,220
moms are the casino gig that was a fun

1250
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,990
one well you got to break into a casino

1251
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:21,430
is a red team anything goes again

1252
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,799
fisherman person ate him pick a lock

1253
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:26,049
break in you know anything except

1254
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,150
breaking doors and stuff this was a gig

1255
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,740
agent that we had done for three years

1256
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,150
in a row and every year this casino has

1257
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,520
gotten better and better they fixed

1258
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:35,080
everything that we got them with every

1259
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,390
single year and I knew this was gonna be

1260
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,670
really difficult so I walk in there and

1261
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,890
it was like the Holy Grail just lit up

1262
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,990
in front of me I I assumed that this was

1263
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,819
going to be like a 50/50 chance of

1264
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,870
failure just because of how good they

1265
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,130
were in the previous year's in the

1266
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:49,720
previous years we'd actually only gotten

1267
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,480
them on a two-week engagement we got

1268
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,069
them in the second Friday of that

1269
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,120
two-week engagement the final day we

1270
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:57,040
could have gotten them we got network

1271
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,190
access and DEA and all that stuff so I'm

1272
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,720
like this is

1273
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,490
no one's gonna blame me if I fail on

1274
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,049
this one it's a casino they have very

1275
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,058
good security cameras everywhere and

1276
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:08,799
entire teams watching those cameras 24

1277
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:11,630
hours a day but as soon as I walked in I

1278
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:12,589
see the business center and the business

1279
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,000
center is where you can print out

1280
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,750
documents and stuff and hotels and

1281
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,859
everything it was closed and I'm like

1282
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,329
sprinting up to my room as soon as I saw

1283
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,240
that business center was closed because

1284
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:26,420
that gives me a perfect pretext to make

1285
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:29,899
the clerk open up my file from a USB I

1286
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:32,180
put a little macro document on my USB

1287
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,309
it's one of those macros that as soon as

1288
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,410
you hit it it looks like it's encoded or

1289
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:38,000
encrypted prior to hitting enable macros

1290
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,069
as soon as you hit enable macros it like

1291
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,750
Dee Creek and says like decrypting and

1292
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:44,210
flashing letters and then you know the

1293
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,039
skull and crossbones pops up and now you

1294
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,839
get an actual document so I put one of

1295
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:49,099
those on there I give it to the clerk I

1296
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,240
said hey listen man like I have a

1297
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,529
meeting in like three minutes

1298
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,000
I really need to print this out for your

1299
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:54,380
business centers closed like how is your

business center closed you're a hotel

1301
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:57,559
you're switched with the print stuff is

1302
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,868
it working okay okay here we go hands

1303
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:01,579
gonna kiss the USB sticks the USB and

1304
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:03,619
sees it's all like weird encryption

1305
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:04,730
nonsense I'm like yeah it's macros you

1306
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:06,950
just had to enable the macros that's it

1307
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,990
just hit that button and he's like okay

1308
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:10,430
it hits the button and then as soon as

1309
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,049
he hits that button there's like a

1310
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:14,589
three-second pause and I hear my phone

1311
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:17,329
buzz and I'm like oh god bless america

1312
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:19,609
I knew I had the shell there and so from

1313
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:20,990
there we were able to just start

1314
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,220
bouncing around we did the credential

1315
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,919
shuffle if anybody's familiar

1316
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,839
he was an administrator on like one

1317
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,309
other computer and so I'll go into that

1318
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,690
one I dumped all the credits from that

1319
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:31,339
one I find another person that's an

1320
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,210
administrator on one other computer I go

1321
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:33,470
into that one and dump all the

1322
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:36,740
credentials and so on and so forth till

1323
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:38,808
we add da so we got da is the first day

1324
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:41,839
that we casino and we're done and so I

1325
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:43,670
go to my boss and I'm like yo man can we

1326
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,470
like goof off now but can we just start

1327
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,779
like we have we have everything we need

1328
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:52,279
and he's like I didn't tell him how we

1329
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:53,930
were gonna goof off strategically and he

1330
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,210
was like yeah I guess so you guys did a

1331
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,410
good job so first we we robbed them of

1332
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,329
money the way we did that is they had a

1333
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:01,190
player database system we found all the

1334
00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:03,500
connections that we know that were

1335
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:04,640
attached to these certain computers

1336
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,990
certain computers have lots of

1337
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,759
connections coming to them we noticed

1338
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,868
one of them was a database server so we

1339
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,460
hopped on the database server we see

1340
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,960
it's the player pointa system

1341
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,339
player point is worth like five

1342
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,930
every time we put a dollar into a slot

1343
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:16,310
machine gives you like one player points

1344
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,080
at one penny or five cents or something

1345
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,330
but that's just a number in a database

1346
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,290
however you can exchange those for real

1347
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:25,790
cash at the cashier so we're like okay

1348
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,980
well now we're millionaires

1349
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,830
fantastic okay done Monday let's start

1350
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,660
goofing off so I was thinking I didn't

1351
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:34,970
really think that my room was quite up

1352
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,710
to par my room was a little small it was

1353
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:38,660
it didn't have a lot of amenities I

1354
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,790
really wanted a nicer room so hop on the

1355
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,098
CEOs email account and I sent an email

1356
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,900
to the front desk there's a couple

1357
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:46,220
contractors here that done some really

1358
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,869
good work actually didn't say a couple

1359
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,098
actually gave myself the room alone I

1360
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,530
didn't help my buddy out at all

1361
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,760
I was like this guy Dan McInerney has

1362
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,650
done some great work for us in the past

1363
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,220
and I'd like you to give him a suite and

1364
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,089
whatnot

1365
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,680
and I send it off and I go down about 20

1366
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:02,839
minutes later and they must have noticed

1367
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,160
just from the smile on my face that I

1368
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,839
was the man that was getting this week

1369
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,810
I'm just strolling up to that place

1370
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:11,960
they're like Dan and I'm like that's me

1371
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:14,029
drop those keys up there on the top

1372
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,800
level presidential suite I was like an

1373
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:18,800
Olympic sized swimming pool in my room

1374
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:21,349
and a high dive it was awesome and then

1375
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,300
we are after that it was all downhill

1376
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:26,990
actually because apparently what I

1377
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,540
didn't know was that oftentimes CEOs

1378
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:34,729
emails will go through their secretary

1379
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:36,680
first and then out to its actual person

1380
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,690
that's supposed to go to I didn't know

1381
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,129
that I know that now and all of you know

1382
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:41,960
that now so please never make this

1383
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,250
mistake either because it seems like a

1384
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,869
really easy thing to do you just hop on

1385
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,670
the CEOs email and you just send emails

1386
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:48,859
all you want no those emails were going

1387
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:52,790
through the secretary the secretary

1388
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:54,560
asked the CEO what was this about like

1389
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,940
who why did you send this I've never

1390
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,980
seen you send an email to the front desk

1391
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,230
before and he's like nope didn't send

1392
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,910
that so they find my room and I get a

1393
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,470
knock we were just about to go out again

1394
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:09,470
and go break into their golf course and

1395
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:12,379
then go steal some golf cards just rides

1396
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:14,598
I get a knock on my door and it's very

1397
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:17,630
authoritative and I look out that door

1398
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:19,670
little a little peephole and I see like

1399
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:21,430
eight cops standing like a like a bunch

1400
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,200
of linebackers just waiting for me

1401
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,808
printouts they could just grab me and

1402
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,339
tackle me open up the door and there and

1403
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,170
they see me in there like you look like

1404
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:32,619
you've been expecting us I'm like well I

1405
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,640
wasn't really but I am now so we

1406
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,740
actually got caught in that one because

1407
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,660
of that email CEO so future reference

1408
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,118
don't send the emails for the CEOs

1409
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,399
account unless you know it's not going

1410
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:43,599
through delete his filters delete all

1411
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,890
the routing and stuff and you can

1412
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,280
probably do it but I didn't do it on

1413
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,230
that one

1414
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,150
alright that's I'm running out of time I

1415
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:53,260
believe so let me take a couple

1416
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:58,319
questions here any questions if not have

1417
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,319
more stories yes

1418
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:10,100
yes I don't know if all of them do I

1419
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,220
know some of them do I would venture to

1420
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:12,220
say

1421
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:21,189
in my experience I've definitely seen

1422
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,700
door handles at work going up and down

1423
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:24,470
sometimes that's not been the case

1424
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,930
though I don't know what the percentages

1425
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:29,959
here I would say most of them work going

1426
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:31,730
up but that's my best guess it does

1427
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,320
sometimes work that's where the film

1428
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:37,430
trick comes in because you're pulling

1429
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:42,140
that door handle up rather than down any

1430
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:44,210
other questions all right real quick

1431
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,950
story then we were doing a water

1432
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,450
treatment facility this was awesome we

1433
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:50,750
had thermal and night-vision we're all

1434
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:52,580
camoed out we actually we're using face

1435
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,740
paint and when you're real pale like me

1436
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:57,170
it actually makes a massive difference

1437
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:00,229
to paint your skin dark tones greens

1438
00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:02,030
blues blacks and then go because the

1439
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,260
water facilities in the woods and they

1440
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,030
had lights all around them and stuff and

1441
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,860
you disappear when you're putting on

1442
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,860
some camouflage face paint and stuff in

1443
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,170
in the pitch-black off the woods of the

1444
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,310
East Coast so we drew in that we did

1445
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,900
that for a couple of nights we broke in

1446
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,640
we use the thermal to track the guards

1447
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,170
we hopped over all the barbed wire

1448
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,400
fences barbed wire fences are a joke

1449
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,780
there's essentially a ladder into the

1450
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,190
place you just take a piece of carpet

1451
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,480
throw it over the fence now you're not

1452
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:25,040
gonna get popped and you just climb the

1453
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,680
fence like a ladder it's so stupid it's

1454
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,070
like 12-foot barbed wire fences and this

1455
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,480
is actually also with Justin when like

1456
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:33,770
oh no that looks like it's gonna be hard

1457
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,480
to get over and then of course you get

1458
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,009
over the first one you're like this is

1459
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,050
silly I don't know why people even use

1460
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,340
this for security so we we didn't have a

1461
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,410
couple nights we start running low on

1462
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,870
our face paint and stuff our favorite

1463
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:46,549
colors were green and blue they just

1464
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,609
they just blended really nicely so we

1465
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:52,010
just used the colors we had left and so

1466
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,360
we're pretty back home completely

1467
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,000
covered from head to toe and the stuff

1468
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,770
so we go get some food right after this

1469
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
we're geared up we're ready to go we

1470
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:01,400
want to get a little energy in us before

1471
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,740
we go sweep all this fast food place we

1472
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,500
hand the guy our money and he looks at

1473
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,359
us like we're crazy people like he

1474
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,860
wanted to punch us in the face and he

1475
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,810
just tosses the bag in our car

1476
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,820
what floor was that about like that's

1477
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,040
weird and then we look at each other as

1478
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:19,249
we're saying that's weird and we're like

1479
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,900
oh my god were in blackface

1480
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:24,209
on that same engagement we were coming

1481
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,859
through in order to get to the place we

1482
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,480
can't park in the there's a there's a a

1483
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:29,759
community park north of the watering

1484
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,079
facility it's a pretty isolated location

1485
00:52:29,759 --> 00:52:32,670
surrounded by woods the community park

1486
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,980
we can't park there because the parking

1487
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,910
is flat and we'll be the only car there

1488
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,789
and the park is closed

1489
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,839
cops will show up guaranteed so we had

1490
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:41,970
to park in a residential neighborhood

1491
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:44,009
about one block north and then find a

1492
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:45,509
pathway like a city-owned pathway to get

1493
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:48,119
back to this park and start wandering in

1494
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:49,890
its water treatment silly we get past

1495
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:51,599
one of these houses so we're walking on

1496
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:54,660
this path that goes to this park and

1497
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,700
we're in a suburban setting there's

1498
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,649
there's houses all around us we walk

1499
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:01,859
past one house as this pathway cuts

1500
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:04,619
through them and a dog lights up on us I

1501
00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:07,470
mean just goes crazy yapping at us and

1502
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:09,720
we are in camo and face pay and we are a

1503
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:11,339
giant bat pads with grappling hooks and

1504
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,959
stuff in them this is not really want to

1505
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:14,880
get caught we don't want anyone to see

1506
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,660
us at this point it's probably midnight

1507
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:20,749
I would say this dog goes insane the

1508
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,038
lightest little yapper ever heard and

1509
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:25,078
after what we freeze for a second before

1510
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,400
were like crap dude we just no running

1511
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:28,109
like we don't see anyone around us we're

1512
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,739
in the situation

1513
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:49,259
turns out the owner of the dog as soon

1514
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:50,609
as he hears the dog start like his back

1515
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,769
door was open and he's just sitting

1516
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:54,420
there like you know nervously shaking

1517
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,950
his tail he looks up and then he looks

1518
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:59,099
at us again and he looks back at his

1519
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:04,649
owner sucker so the one time this dog

1520
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:07,529
actually lights up he gets the crap out

1521
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,390
of them that house is not gonna be safe

1522
00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:10,819
for many years to come I think that's

1523
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,650
the end of my time

1524
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:18,380
so thank you very much I hope you guys

1525
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,380
learned something and have a good week
