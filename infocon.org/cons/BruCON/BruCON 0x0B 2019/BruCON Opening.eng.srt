1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:14,309
good morning hello and welcome the 11th

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,289
edition we are so glad to be here right

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,509
now because we have to be honest it has

4
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,279
been a very difficult year for us as an

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,170
organization last year we had the 10th

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,820
edition we really hyped up to the 10th

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,830
edition we put a lot of efforts in there

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,599
and it's not like we didn't want to put

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,189
a lot of efforts in the 11th edition but

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
it was just a difficult year for us as a

11
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,079
coup so some people got married some

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,149
people took all the jobs which made them

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,340
obviously I have other priorities in

14
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,379
life and that's not always easy but I'm

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,180
not here to share only negative news so

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,460
but I just wanted to tell you guys this

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,730
that we're so glad we're here I was so

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,620
glad to see that we've kicked it off so

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,110
second of all again this year we sold

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,120
out much quicker than last year so it

21
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,820
took us about three weeks little over

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,589
three weeks and we were sold out last

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,109
year it was about a month month and a

24
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,100
half before we completely sold out and

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,080
we actually sell out

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,710
alright Achatz again before we publish

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,539
any schedule this is to us a very

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,580
positive thing because we know that you

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,140
guys trust in the schedule we're gonna

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,570
build later on and you buy tickets

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,280
anyway or you just buy it because we

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,229
have beer that could be also a reason

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,080
alright so it's hard to judge but then

34
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,908
