1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:13,070
good morning how's everyone doing wow

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:17,930
that is the interaction I was told I'd

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:24,110
get zero all right so let's see if this

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:27,530
thing all works yes it does this is a

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,810
little bit about me let's just say that

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,910
I've been around a little bit I've

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,800
worked for big small companies I've

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,210
worked for government agencies

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,480
contracting consulting lots of different

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,280
things and the only reason I'm actually

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,250
going into this usually I skip it

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,920
because it doesn't matter is to show you

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,350
that I have had experience with a lot of

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,469
different types of organizations so

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,460
where I'm coming from is as a as a seat

16
00:00:54,469 --> 00:01:00,440
of experience on not just one company or

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,110
two companies but like a bunch of

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,069
different companies I've also helped

19
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,479
with different organizations but the

20
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:11,389
only thing that should matter is that I

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,389
have a certificate that says I know I

22
00:01:11,389 --> 00:01:20,209
have a BS in cybersecurity so all of

23
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:24,590
this is BS come on that was funny all

24
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:28,219
right this is all we're gonna start and

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:31,299
I have prizes so if I do get an

26
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:35,469
interaction there's prizes

27
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:38,289
so please raise your hand if you know

28
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:44,068
what that thing is up there on the

29
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:48,250
screen krb TGT keep it raised very hard

30
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:53,740
all right keep it raised like there we

31
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:54,569
go all right if you have an idea of what

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,860
that is

33
00:01:54,569 --> 00:02:00,009
keep it raised if you think you can

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,670
change the password for that thing every

35
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,670
six months

36
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:10,660
keep it raised if you think you can

37
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:12,430
change it every week not a single hand

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,250
oh there we go we got two hands

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:20,340
how about everyday and there's the hands

40
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,670
so it's a trick question

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:29,290
the krbtgt is the thing that signs all

42
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,510
of the Kerberos tickets in Windows it's

43
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,650
the thing that controls how Kerberos

44
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,280
talks in Windows that krbtgt password

45
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:42,930
can change as fast as your domain

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,799
controllers can sync it which can be

47
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,709
five minutes two hours a day two days

48
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:52,359
whatever it is however long it takes and

49
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:53,440
this is the problem this is what I'm

50
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:56,470
going to be talking about in this

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,230
keynote is that the information about

52
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,920
real security about real changes doesn't

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:06,910
disseminate very well and I'll talk

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,358
about why so we're gonna get real go

55
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,950
uncomfortable because some of these some

56
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:15,250
of these little mantras that we're going

57
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:19,599
to talk about are things that all of you

58
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,790
including myself talk about at

59
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,418
conferences and complain about at

60
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,470
conferences every single one of these

61
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,810
that I'm going to be talking about I

62
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:33,370
have heard already at this conference I

63
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,989
was at training so that's cheating a

64
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,109
little bit but I've already heard all of

65
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:41,190
these complaints so this is what we call

66
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:43,770
the InfoSec echo chamber

67
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:48,570
literally in a chamber speaking and

68
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:51,660
echoing it's great so we're gonna talk

69
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:56,750
about each one of these first one users

70
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,750
are dumb right absolutely

71
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:06,330
bastards will never get better NFA is

72
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:10,950
the way to go just use proper password

73
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:17,360
managers no one ever listens to us open

74
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:17,360
Wi-Fi is bad antivirus is useless right

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:25,800
roll your own crypto is a bad idea that

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:33,900
one should get at least a couple nods

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:38,190
right blinky boxes are bad it's legacy

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:41,310
you can't touch it just sanitize input

79
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:44,160
just turn off NPM just just just

80
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,490
everything else you can't measure

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,730
security why why would you try and IT

82
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,080
sucks it asset management these are all

83
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,600
things we agree on yes yeah every one of

84
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,880
those is exactly right and that's the

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,970
problem

86
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:08,219
so users are dumb computer users

87
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:13,680
employees and non security people don't

88
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,180
tend to follow best practices yes okay

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,830
I'm gonna sit right here until I get

90
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,090
some kind of interaction there we go

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,250
one of the biggest targets in an

92
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,880
organization is definitely the users

93
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,560
right all right phishing is also the

94
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,770
number one cause of breaches in the last

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,310
year that's the problem so what are we

96
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,310
doing about it

97
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not going to repeat that where we're

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:53,179
training the users right we're teaching

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:55,070
them our job so users will continue to

100
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,860
click on random and sketchy software

101
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,690
with Macker of them yes it's going to

102
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,400
happen no matter how much we teach them

103
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:06,260
our job user awareness training can help

104
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,448
decrease these numbers but we're talking

105
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,969
about vitamin C anyone know about

106
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,510
vitamin C what does vitamin C do what

107
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:18,530
does your mom tell you about vitamin C

108
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,449
it helps prevent colds right so we'll

109
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,859
talk about that in a second user

110
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,510
awareness training is just another

111
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,449
corporate training that everyone

112
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,130
including you clicks as hard as you can

113
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:31,140
next next next next next next next

114
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,699
where's my certificate right

115
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,050
[Applause]

116
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:38,000
incentivizing security is by far the

117
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,760
better answer how many of you in this

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,440
room have heard about security awareness

119
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:48,260
through incentives very a couple okay we

120
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,080
got a couple do you know what this means

121
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,020
that security awareness can be set up in

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,859
a way that is not a next next next next

123
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,139
finish it say hey I reported something

124
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,330
and I get points how much do you think

125
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,999
it costs a corporation to give out

126
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:14,049
points zero

127
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:16,179
so if I give everyone points for for

128
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:18,399
turning in a fish that turns out to be

129
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:22,448
malicious or or stop you with someone

130
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,999
who is trying to tailgate how do you

131
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:29,489
think the users feel about that those

132
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:31,829
points greater than zero right because

133
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:35,138
they can use those points or something

134
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:35,999
or they just get to be the number one on

135
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,959
the list

136
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:46,329
competition is amazing is an amazing

137
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:48,579
instigator of change so why aren't we

138
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:52,449
using these programs instead of the next

139
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:55,419
next next next give me my cert why isn't

140
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:58,209
that more out there why isn't why aren't

141
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:04,119
more people doing that it's because we

142
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,949
are speaking in an echo chamber so

143
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:09,219
vitamin C just as an aside doesn't

144
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:11,679
really do anything it's been proven that

145
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,229
all it does is help to shorten the

146
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:16,599
amount of time you have your cold versus

147
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:21,489
actually stopping a cold and it doesn't

148
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:25,719
even shorten it that much so to give you

149
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:28,808
guys an example this is Steve this is

150
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,399
Bob he's saying Steve can you believe

151
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:33,869
that the idiots leaving here don't even

152
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,869
know the first thing about self defense

153
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:46,949
he's speaking about his users the people

154
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:49,599
he's guarding in that house I know right

155
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,370
they answered asked me to quit bothering

156
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,009
about teaching them about knife

157
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,600
awareness drills don't they know it

158
00:08:54,009 --> 00:09:01,300
could just be mugged at any time walking

159
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:05,709
down the street that's Steve these two

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:08,128
individuals are being paid to keep

161
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,128
security

162
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:18,329
of the people in the house they're users

163
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:23,849
I threw this one in just just for fun

164
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:26,399
you guys noticed the difference in

165
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:28,560
between the bubbles he's actually saying

166
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:38,000
something he just thinks it because he

167
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:42,619
can't speak starting to feel this right

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,620
doesn't feel great it's uncomfortable

169
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:57,859
at what point do we realize that at no

170
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:00,819
point during non-security peoples day do

171
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,830
they think about that tank rolling in

172
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:08,150
north should they if you have a tank

173
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:11,450
rolling into a house and you have

174
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,400
security people do you do you do you

175
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,550
leave the people in the house and say

176
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:20,390
good good luck

177
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:22,490
yes but like you either take them with

178
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,160
you or you barricade or do something

179
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,920
that is their job the security person's

180
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,170
it's Stephen Bob's job to make sure that

181
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,120
those people are safe from that tank

182
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:43,370
right it is not the people in the houses

183
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:47,990
job to go out front and go so why are we

184
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:51,680
making it their job the hard truth is is

185
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:54,610
not we need to stop blaming them for not

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,609
doing our job

187
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:09,699
does that make sense

188
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:11,439
socks but it makes sense search will

189
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,680
never get better don't write them down

190
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:19,060
use mfa password managers has anyone

191
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:27,130
ever taught a non security person how to

192
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:29,890
use a password manager try to nice how

193
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:35,640
hard is it because these password

194
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:39,040
managers suck they are user unfriendly

195
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,199
their user friendly to us that's what we

196
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,430
have to get past their user friendly to

197
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,430
us because we know how they work

198
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:55,510
anyone teach a CEO how to use a password

199
00:11:46,960 --> 00:12:00,480
manager stop Fontan most people pick bad

200
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:03,580
passwords for things you do too I

201
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,530
guarantee that at least five laptops in

202
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,410
this room right now have the word

203
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,750
password in the password and we're

204
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:15,610
security people just because we're lazy

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:19,420
I got nods over here so we're good I got

206
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,100
at least two password managers aren't

207
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:26,650
supported in many places it's weird

208
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,120
anyone ever use a website that you can't

209
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:34,600
copy and paste into because of security

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:40,030
it's for banks it's always banks it's

211
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:44,620
horrible we keep feeding the media

212
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:47,199
stories about 2fa and how bad SMS is

213
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,290
anyone everyone thinks SMS based to a

214
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,280
PHA is bad right everyone's thinking

215
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,399
better like they're like not maybe this

216
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,750
is trick

217
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:04,410
but that users general non tech people

218
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:09,850
don't understand the difference between

219
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:11,790
SMS to FA an app-based to FA it's not

220
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,980
their job to know the difference right

221
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,310
but when you say two-factor

222
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:23,100
authentication SMS it's bad all they

223
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,099
hear is two-factor authentication is bad

224
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,020
so why do we keep doing it why do SMS is

225
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,520
actually pretty good unless you're

226
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,949
dealing with someone who can actually

227
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:39,310
spoof a base station which is kind of

228
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:41,290
easy but kind of hard like it's not it's

229
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,520
not something I can just go do in a few

230
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,920
seconds I have to actually learn

231
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,630
something to do it right and I have to

232
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,630
be very targeted about who I go after

233
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,390
and I have to know that they're doing to

234
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,540
a PHA at the time or cause it to happen

235
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,120
like there's a lot of steps involved but

236
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,160
we're saying - if a SMS is bad and then

237
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:10,120
that's it we're not giving them any

238
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:13,660
solutions simple truths password

239
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,850
managers are hard to use - if a MFA is

240
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,899
difficult to use anyone in here and you

241
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:24,670
know what this is a prize worthy one so

242
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:28,300
why anyone in here successfully migrated

243
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:36,000
all of their 2fa tokens from one phone

244
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:36,000
to another without problems bullshit

245
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:45,320
I saw that handle sorry I'm gonna hit

246
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:49,250
someone I don't believe you but I'm

247
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:54,950
gonna give you a prize anyways so we

248
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:58,760
tell people not to write them down let's

249
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,290
stop making fun of this I see at least

250
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,110
once a month

251
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,290
sew-on has a picture of this exact book

252
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:11,420
and is laughing about it

253
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:14,000
why I taught my mom how to use this in

254
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,689
two seconds she has a different password

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,620
for everything now on different websites

256
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:24,770
because she uses this book what threat

257
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,320
actor is she gonna deal with it home her

258
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:32,990
husband great

259
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,940
like how many apt actors can change the

260
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:40,070
direction of a mic that's built into a

261
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:42,110
laptop none right when are they gonna

262
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,180
see it out when she's typing their

263
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,260
password in when they already can access

264
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:53,329
it via the keylogger why is this a bad

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:57,200
thing why do we keep on saying that this

266
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:59,270
is a bad thing it's not it actually

267
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,630
works in corporate environments too if

268
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,730
they put it in their drawer big deal the

269
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,000
only threat actors that we're dealing

270
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:09,860
with when they use this is an emotion

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,820
insider who already has access who

272
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,350
doesn't need this book great you can do

273
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:19,070
a physical assessment against them and

274
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:21,110
get the book what does that prove I can

275
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,260
just sit down at the Machine and get

276
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:27,770
passwords another way we need to stop

277
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:31,189
making fun of this because we we're

278
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:36,470
getting looked at as an industry for

279
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:39,640
guidance on how to do this stuff and

280
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,640
we're not giving them solutions

281
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:47,050
so no one ever listens to us right

282
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,200
that's what we think in our heads that's

283
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:54,910
what I see on Twitter but the world is

284
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:57,490
looking at security now do you

285
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,130
understand that pressure we got to get

286
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:06,190
this right the world is looking at

287
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:09,369
information security management buy-in

288
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:12,430
on security projects is hard not any

289
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,500
more than throwing money at us security

290
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:18,100
programs are sometimes undervalued

291
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,690
absolutely because we lie about them we

292
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:24,129
regularly advise and condescending

293
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:33,490
expensive and full of friction and hard

294
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:35,230
to follow ways absolutely I'm sure none

295
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,890
of you in here have ever has ever been

296
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,710
condescending to a manager who just

297
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:45,900
doesn't get it

298
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:48,280
not once I'm sure none of you have ever

299
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,330
said this is gonna cost a million

300
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,129
dollars or $100,000 because we're going

301
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,409
to buy the blinky box or build it

302
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,400
ourselves or whatever I'm sure none of

303
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:08,100
you have ever had full of friction

304
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:14,250
conversations with managers who or or

305
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:17,889
executives who just didn't get it right

306
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:21,520
we need to stop companies survive it pay

307
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:24,700
salaries based on revenue we need to

308
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,990
realize that like we know it in the back

309
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,770
of our head and right now you guys are

310
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,780
think I know how do you knew that but we

311
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:38,070
need to realize it out here instead of

312
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:41,470
in here just because you think that

313
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,879
building out this sock the security

314
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,230
operations center should happen right

315
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
now because we're dealing with all these

316
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,440
threats doesn't mean the company can

317
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
afford it

318
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,779
would you rather them fire you and build

319
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:59,070
the sock so that they can take your

320
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:02,399
salary and build the sock or would you

321
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:07,590
rather keep your job and build it out

322
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:12,479
slowly and security keeps on getting

323
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:16,889
more expensive now do you know the

324
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:21,330
average cost of an appliance

325
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:23,100
yes blinky box from RSA what's the

326
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,249
average cost they did they actually made

327
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,529
a article about this on our essays blog

328
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:31,529
what do you think the average cost is

329
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:32,700
you know what this is another prize see

330
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:39,649
if we can get some interaction going

331
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,649
here 5,000 no sorry

332
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:50,070
10,000 dollars US dollars

333
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:52,460
550 K getting closer note 150 K is not

334
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,460
even close

335
00:19:53,529 --> 00:20:04,210
200,000 nope I'm sorry 700k very very

336
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:07,700
close I'm sorry

337
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,840
790 it was 750 so I'm gonna give it to

338
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:13,720
this guy over here weird

339
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,720
who said 750 all right here we go

340
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:30,230
$750,000 was the average cost of a

341
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:31,700
blinky box of Rs a this year average how

342
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,299
many people in here thinks that that's

343
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,559
way too expensive for a blinky box

344
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,889
everyone who thinks they can build a

345
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:42,158
better one

346
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:42,158
big difference

347
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,480
our truth we complain constantly when we

348
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,470
don't get away

349
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,750
we extort companies who who don't do

350
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:02,480
things we want them to do everyone never

351
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:04,269
heard of full disclosure this is this is

352
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,010
good for the industry or at least was

353
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:09,110
because extortion of this like saying

354
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,809
that this is like they need to fix

355
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,689
things and get them to move was actually

356
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:16,730
a good thing for a long time it's not

357
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,100
being it's not that very much anymore

358
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,090
like its rarity where you have to push

359
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:29,320
that hard but we still do it internally

360
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:31,760
I have seen bug bounty programs go from

361
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,379
they're not gonna pay me a dollar or

362
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,190
there's only gonna pay me points or

363
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,720
whatever they marked it as non non not

364
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,639
gonna fix and then they published it to

365
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,269
you know to get it to get fixed is that

366
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,269
a good thing or bad thing

367
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:58,340
yes we lowered our power overs and

368
00:21:53,090 --> 00:22:00,740
flaunt it regularly at conferences this

369
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:05,139
might not be brew cotton is I have never

370
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:08,510
been but I have gone to too many talks

371
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:12,950
where the speaker is up here just like I

372
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,990
am right now saying I own the world I'm

373
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:22,370
better than everyone I did all these

374
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:25,550
things and it's hard it sucks because as

375
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:29,479
someone who's listening to that I can

376
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:33,669
see that the reason why non tech people

377
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,670
don't want to go to security conferences

378
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,280
and we've been forced to talk in

379
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:42,280
business terms instead of hacker terms

380
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,280
forced

381
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:56,960
the this is actually a comment that I

382
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,200
heard here at brew con during the

383
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,600
training someone actually said to me

384
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,110
that they are being forced to talk into

385
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,740
in business terms instead of hacker

386
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:14,149
terms what does that mean that means

387
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:17,929
that they feel like they have to do what

388
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,429
the business is asking them to do that's

389
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,820
a really bad attitude

390
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:24,440
right just because you're a hacker just

391
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,678
because you're into InfoSec just because

392
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,440
you know amazing things and I guarantee

393
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,860
everyone in here knows amazing things

394
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:39,049
and can hack the world in five hundred

395
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:41,270
different ways doesn't mean that we are

396
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:43,610
better than the business that we are

397
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:48,230
working for doesn't mean that we get to

398
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:52,189
tell them what to do because they're

399
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:56,870
paying our salary to do it we are kind

400
00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:03,230
of a bunch of jerks I told you we get

401
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:05,330
uncomfortable you me everyone in here

402
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,030
might individually not be jerks but when

403
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,830
we get together when we get in a pack

404
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:25,820
that's when it can get bad open Wi-Fi is

405
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:27,799
bad right open Wi-Fi is bad so in

406
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,320
between man-in-the-middle all that stuff

407
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:38,629
was super easy right so let's play a

408
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:43,070
game I want you to raise your hands and

409
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:47,660
keep them raised if you have ever done

410
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:51,770
the evil twin attack on wireless or spun

411
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:54,660
up a another access point to

412
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,980
to hack into another to pretend to be

413
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,270
another access point to act tack a

414
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,730
client ever

415
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:03,660
if you've ever done it keep your hands

416
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:06,780
raised right if you've if you have

417
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:12,809
successfully gotten code execution on

418
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:15,299
that client keep your hands raised if

419
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:18,780
you have successfully gotten code

420
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:21,660
execution on a client via the evil twin

421
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:29,790
attack within the last year keep your

422
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:33,410
hands raised and that's my point some

423
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:37,230
truth is most websites use tls/ssl

424
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:40,400
thanks encrypt chrome changes constantly

425
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,990
so it's super hard to attack the browser

426
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,160
host-based firewalls being on by default

427
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,590
is actually a really cool thing

428
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,540
solutions where you find the crux of the

429
00:25:49,590 --> 00:26:00,540
problem is where we need to focus our

430
00:25:51,540 --> 00:26:05,040
time saying open Wi-Fi is bad is just

431
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:08,100
the symptom of systems that don't do

432
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:12,899
transport and egress and ingress

433
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:16,230
filtering correctly not a single hand

434
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,730
raise that I could see had actually done

435
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,910
an evil twin attack in the last year

436
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,330
year and a half and I guarantee even at

437
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,740
Def Con

438
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,449
the only people are raising their hands

439
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,450
are liars or nation states

440
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:35,279
and I guarantee the nation states won't

441
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,879
raise their hand so why are we saying

442
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,730
that open Wi-Fi is bad because we've

443
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:46,860
always said it right we've always said

444
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:49,289
it so if I can't get if there's one

445
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,049
thing out of this whole talk that I can

446
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:55,789
get you guys to stop saying is that open

447
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:58,620
Wi-Fi is bad we need to start fixing our

448
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:00,450
mantras that we tell the college

449
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,668
students and the high school students

450
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:06,539
and in next generations of hackers that

451
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:08,460
are coming up that all of these things

452
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:14,158
that were bad when we were getting into

453
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:18,029
InfoSec are still bad antivirus is

454
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:22,440
useless right not a signal is the war

455
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:28,440
it's always a trick signature-based

456
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:31,559
detection sucks right signature so super

457
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,740
easy to bypass if you if you here in

458
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,158
Didier's class he showed you exactly how

459
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:42,990
to get past all of the macro enabled AV

460
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:47,990
detections very few companies ever look

461
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:53,720
at AV logs I'll give you a little story

462
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:55,679
so I was I was in the Marine Corps and

463
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,659
while I was in the Marine Corps there

464
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:04,139
was a wonderful set up as someone new to

465
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:08,249
InfoSec I was I was the go-to for all of

466
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:09,809
the the horrible jobs like looking

467
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:13,769
through logs or looking through paper

468
00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:18,330
logs or all the all the all the not so

469
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:23,519
fun work and during this time there were

470
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:25,799
some AV logs on paper printed out of all

471
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:31,830
of the detections that had happened in

472
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:36,149
the solutions so it said wthr.com plug

473
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,730
in detected removed wthr.com plug in

474
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:40,719
detected remove spyware detected remove

475
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,659
quarantine quarantine

476
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,520
remove remove remove removed now if it's

477
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:51,789
removed and quarantined there's no

478
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:57,250
problem right what if I told you that

479
00:28:51,789 --> 00:29:02,679
one of those on that sheet of paper was

480
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:06,150
PW dump dot exe and who knows what pww

481
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:10,600
XE is who's old enough to have used it

482
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:16,450
all right what is it can you guess

483
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:20,039
anybody password dumper but it was a

484
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:23,380
roof in quarantine so it's fine right

485
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:30,039
what if I told you that it was on a web

486
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,720
server is quarantined removed so what's

487
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,620
the problem

488
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:40,240
anybody what's the problem how did it

489
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,799
get there who said that nice is it I

490
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,260
didn't didn't I just tell you that story

491
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:50,970
last night

492
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:53,350
geez cheater so how did it get there

493
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:56,350
it got there somehow right you got

494
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,658
removed is gone somehow right how many

495
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:01,330
organizations in this room don't raise

496
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:03,030
your hands because you're lying look at

497
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,428
AV logs right

498
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:09,190
not very many especially the ones that

499
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,010
say it's been removed quarantined

500
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,480
why would I look at those logs at all

501
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,559
those are some of the best indicators of

502
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,540
compromise that you can come across oh

503
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,970
it was on a domain controller sorry

504
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,759
[Applause]

505
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:27,879
so low-hanging fruit is the bread and

506
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:30,610
butter of Av it doesn't matter if you

507
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:33,340
can bypass it super simple it's not

508
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:37,570
there to get all of the advanced stuff

509
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:40,389
those stuff that is crazy and already

510
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,970
knows about the AV and knows the bypass

511
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:44,559
it's there to catch all of the easy

512
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:49,360
stuff the stuff that you don't want to

513
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,039
spend your time on so we need to stop

514
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,580
saying then it's useless we need to stop

515
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:58,350
saying that it doesn't do anything that

516
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:03,189
it's easy to bypass these statements are

517
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:05,709
hurting our industry because the CEOs

518
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,450
the CSO's the the executives the

519
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,879
managers that we want us to want to

520
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,750
listen to us hear us ranting about this

521
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:17,139
and then they're like well why would we

522
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:19,750
redo our license for whatever semantics

523
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:23,860
Sophos whatever why would we renew our

524
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,509
license if it sucks why would we spend

525
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,219
more money on it why are you telling me

526
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,610
to spend more money on it when you

527
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,190
online just said or or just in this last

528
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,019
meeting said it's horrible it's easy to

529
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:44,409
bypass why would I spend more money on

530
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:46,299
it so stop bagging on AV it actually

531
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:50,350
does a lot more than more than we say it

532
00:31:46,299 --> 00:31:53,950
does and if it does happen to be junk

533
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:57,519
there are some babies that don't even

534
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:01,200
catch the low-hanging fruit so if it is

535
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,840
remove it get a new one make the change

536
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,139
do something instead of just yelling and

537
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,449
screaming and saying hey v-- sucks but

538
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:13,379
our statements matter and we need to

539
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:13,379
start realizing that

540
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:21,240
roll your own crypto software and/or

541
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:26,210
software is stupid blinky boxes don't

542
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,210
fix anything anyone see the problem here

543
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:32,309
we're telling companies that they

544
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:35,720
shouldn't do it themselves and then

545
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,720
we're telling them don't buy the things

546
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:44,700
what's left so blinky boxes for vendors

547
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,590
actually rarely ever do anything that's

548
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,290
what we say building your own software

549
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,970
to do what a blinky box does really

550
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:54,000
results in an actual finished product

551
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:56,309
how many people have worked on a on a

552
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,440
project that was supposed to do the

553
00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:04,190
blinky box thing and never actually

554
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,419
finished thank you for being honest

555
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:10,080
building authentication on crypto is

556
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:16,410
hard to do well and usually left to

557
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:19,260
frameworks so we're telling companies

558
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:21,570
that they can't really do either buy a

559
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,010
solution or build it the results of

560
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:27,090
miscommunication capabilities and

561
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:30,179
project timelines so what are we

562
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,159
supposed to do what's the solution here

563
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:35,190
if I can't tell a company to build it

564
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,200
themselves and I can't tell a company to

565
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:45,179
buy the thing what are they supposed to

566
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:48,149
do anybody

567
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,219
by the best available by the best blinky

568
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:54,418
box how do I know what the best blinky

569
00:33:50,219 --> 00:33:56,129
boxes I have to spend $750,000 on a

570
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:02,669
binky box it's going to cost me a lot so

571
00:33:56,129 --> 00:34:07,139
I better be the best blinky boxes

572
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:08,700
actually have solid results if if the

573
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:13,529
InfoSec people actually invest the time

574
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,719
in configuring them I know way too many

575
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:18,690
companies that have bought the blinky

576
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:21,058
boxes and never configured it or never

577
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,220
spent the time or looked at the vendor

578
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,260
and said you guys suck I'm not gonna

579
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:29,009
look at your stuff or I don't want to

580
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,500
look at the extra pane of glass I don't

581
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,520
want to look at another portal that I

582
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,039
have to look into just to do my job if I

583
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,149
have to look in seven different logins

584
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:47,520
just to do my job

585
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:50,839
I don't water anyone have kids that's

586
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,839
exactly what we sound like

587
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:05,839
we're getting paid to do this it's

588
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:05,839
legacy that's what that sound is

589
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:12,089
everyone on the planet that works in

590
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:20,098
InfoSec makes that exact sound whenever

591
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:22,380
we hear the word legacy because we don't

592
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,579
get anywhere with it right the companies

593
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:29,400
are like it's legacy you can't touch it

594
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:33,650
it's legacy we can't change it it's

595
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,650
legacy it's legacy

596
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:42,689
tell you story about legacy at General

597
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,490
Electric we had the d20 the d20 had a

598
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,400
vulnerability that came out really

599
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:51,020
rapidly d 20s are things that are ICS

600
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,370
systems that go into power stations

601
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:57,820
General Electric

602
00:35:54,370 --> 00:36:00,339
has to sell these things to customers to

603
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:05,490
power stations to most municipalities to

604
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:10,300
small little towns that run these D 20s

605
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:13,299
now a d20 is the legacy device or it

606
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,900
used to be it's something that has been

607
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:20,230
around since 1970

608
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:25,630
it had telnet open on 423

609
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:30,460
unauthenticated who thinks that's a

610
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:35,200
critical vulnerability why it's from the

611
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:38,590
70s who thinks that's gonna change very

612
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:43,799
fast nothing new people right

613
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,800
so yes it's a vulnerability yes it's bad

614
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:56,070
but this came at a time when port 23

615
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:59,880
open with authentication didn't matter

616
00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:02,800
and wasn't a big deal because no one had

617
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,310
machines connected to the Internet

618
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,230
back then you had just this block box

619
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,970
that did its job that does its job very

620
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,240
well

621
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:16,029
so how much do you think it would cost

622
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:20,200
General Electric to replace every D 20

623
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,510
across the United States just to block

624
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,720
the port 23 and how long do you think

625
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:29,520
he'd take we did estimates so I know

626
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:34,959
what do you think estimates 10 billion

627
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,310
close to billion dollars do you know how

628
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,170
long it would take to change every

629
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:40,170
single one across the u.s.

630
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:50,930
five to seven years do you know how long

631
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:53,640
the researcher gave us to fix it 90 days

632
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:56,810
we were expected to spend two million

633
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,270
two billion dollars within 90 days and

634
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:04,230
get them changed out but that's the

635
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:08,690
mindset we have that's the vulnerability

636
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:11,580
disclosure programs we have 90 days

637
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:15,840
which is okay in some cases which I

638
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:19,590
completely agree with in some cases so

639
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,490
what did we do anyone know the story

640
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:28,430
like it was in the news quite a bit we

641
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,430
sued him no that would be the bad idea

642
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:36,090
sue said firewall that's exactly what we

643
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:38,310
did when we came together as a security

644
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:42,120
group inside of GE we say we're like

645
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:45,000
okay what are we gonna do the CEO of the

646
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:48,779
company is saying fix it and well and

647
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,870
they're listening to us so someone had

648
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,620
the idea to get a Raspberry Pi put

649
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:57,480
another interface on it and send them to

650
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,109
all of our customers to put in front of

651
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,110
the g20 s

652
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:07,500
well-being GE we couldn't just go

653
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,480
halfway on it and put raspberry PI's so

654
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,790
they made a piece of hardware that was

655
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,980
essentially just IP tables with port 23

656
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:16,009
blocked and we send it out to all of our

657
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:21,450
customers do you know how much that cost

658
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:23,790
each unit was 15 cents our solution to

659
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,189
the president of the company

660
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,890
costs just over a hundred thousand

661
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:31,020
dollars for everything from the hardware

662
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:33,960
to the installation to get enough

663
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,509
employees out to go fix it to billion

664
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,360
dollars down to a hundred thousand

665
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:42,110
dollars these are the types of solutions

666
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,950
we need to work on things that work and

667
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:48,060
stop saying that legacy is not fixable

668
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:51,439
we need to look at solutions that

669
00:39:48,060 --> 00:40:01,839
actually fix the problem not the symptom

670
00:39:51,440 --> 00:40:01,839
we need to stop being scared of it so

671
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:09,348
legacy systems should not be given

672
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,750
exceptions we need to find solutions we

673
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:15,619
need to do the work that needs to be

674
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:19,339
done on these things if it's legacy we

675
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:21,740
need to do the work spend the time

676
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:24,369
figure out the fix stop giving it an

677
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,368
exception

678
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,430
we need to stop screaming and whining

679
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:43,510
that it's not a hundred percent solution

680
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:49,480
alright so just I really hate this word

681
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:51,160
just sanitize input how many of you are

682
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,140
in here are developers or have been

683
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,089
developers in the past how many have

684
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,520
heard the word just sanitize input and

685
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:06,520
got pissed yeah

686
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:11,259
I'm sorry just disable ntlm off just

687
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,640
disable w Pat just disable macros how

688
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,710
many of how many of you have tried to

689
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:25,230
get a company to just disable macros

690
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:29,170
how many worked I don't believe you so

691
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,940
this is not easy we we we do the like

692
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:36,250
pen testers we put these in reports and

693
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:39,040
stuff right and and we rarely do the

694
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:41,650
thing we're telling the company to do or

695
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,710
we do it on our own systems we make

696
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:52,000
solutions on our own little labs that

697
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:56,550
totally work but they don't work they

698
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,540
don't scale did you know that

699
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:04,660
Dobby pad NetBIOS that we've had ll mar

700
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:07,930
these attacks that people have used for

701
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,540
internal attacks for a responder and and

702
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,819
until M relay X and s and B relay X and

703
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,940
all of these other tools do you know

704
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,850
that the fix to this is a per user per

705
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:23,860
device problem Windows has network

706
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:28,110
settings per user per device yet we give

707
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:31,120
out these recommendations to just fix it

708
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:33,460
this is hard it's actually really hard

709
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,319
you have to set group policy settings in

710
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,600
a bunch of different ways including some

711
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,900
registry key changes just to get this

712
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,900
fixed

713
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,560
sorry one sec

714
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:03,690
and macros are enabled for our

715
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:06,420
sanitizing input isn't always easy to do

716
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:09,030
it's really easy to do some of the

717
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:10,440
frameworks make it easier and that's

718
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:14,820
where the fix has to happen in the

719
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,160
frameworks developers use a lot of

720
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:22,110
frameworks the Django dotnet all of

721
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,390
these different frameworks make it a lot

722
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:26,310
easier to fix these things but they have

723
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,109
to do it in the framework they have to

724
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:32,580
have fixes available in the framework

725
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:37,950
because doing this on a custom code base

726
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:43,310
is not easy the office macros are widely

727
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:45,810
used and for legitimate purposes so I

728
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:51,270
was doing this test one time this pen

729
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:53,009
test one time and we broken in and we

730
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,650
looked around and couldn't find anything

731
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:58,830
we were coming up short on every

732
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:02,550
assessment of services that we're

733
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:04,350
looking at we're trying to get in to

734
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,150
this box in that box in this box and it

735
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:10,650
was just hitting brick wall after brick

736
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:12,270
wall which is awesome but we looked

737
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:15,020
around the system that we had access to

738
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:21,780
you and there was all these doc m and

739
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:26,640
xlsm unbox a files all over the system

740
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:30,830
we had just so happened to the the box

741
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:37,040
that we had fished was a finance officer

742
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:47,580
who sends out this doc m to all of her

743
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:50,130
finance engineers sorry every day so we

744
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:54,960
added some macros to her macros and it

745
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:56,430
was great but the point is office macros

746
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,770
are widely used for legitimate purposes

747
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,720
and it's really hard to turn it off so

748
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:04,290
what we have to do is segment those

749
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,100
users in group policy and figure out how

750
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,990
to fix it that way

751
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,049
and turn it off for the rest of the

752
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,959
world inside your organization and find

753
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:16,390
those actual solutions versus stuff that

754
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:21,400
is like in a pen test report just

755
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:23,950
disable macros and swallow in our own

756
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,680
medicine is really hard because

757
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:32,109
implementing the fixes in your test lab

758
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:36,910
or your last job sorry doesn't mean it

759
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:38,740
scales well I have read too many pen

760
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:43,299
test reports I've written too many pens

761
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:46,120
test reports that had simple solutions

762
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:50,410
that when tried to implement in a big

763
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:54,130
organization just don't work they don't

764
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:58,779
scale or they're given to people who

765
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:00,940
don't understand the fix because I

766
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:05,770
didn't just put enough information in

767
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:11,020
there anyone try and measure

768
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:17,259
cybersecurity stuff anyone in Metrix not

769
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:20,310
us one too cool can't measure security

770
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,310
secures a feeling

771
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:26,890
Chris Nickerson actually said this best

772
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,890
security is literally a feeling people

773
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:33,439
feel secure that those those security

774
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,380
guards in the end the meme earlier

775
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
they're not there to secure the place

776
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:44,300
their mayor there to make the people

777
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,099
inside feel secure you can't secure

778
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,630
something you can get it to the point

779
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:52,310
where you feel like it is but that's it

780
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:53,960
and it's really hard to measure feelings

781
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:57,849
because they are arbitrary and they

782
00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:02,530
change all the time anyone have a CEO

783
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:05,329
come back from vacation just have read

784
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:09,800
the newest article in The New York Times

785
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:16,690
about XYZ security and say we need to

786
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:19,460
fix this down right that's a feeling

787
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:23,119
they feel insecure because they read it

788
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:29,710
in the news we feel insecure all the

789
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:32,599
time because it's open Wi-Fi all right

790
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:35,150
so how do we fix this how do we how do

791
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:39,140
we say or measure this feeling that we

792
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:43,599
have we need to measure it based on

793
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:45,799
performed actions so here are some ideas

794
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:52,280
how about how many new rules were

795
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:56,480
created me as a pen tester if I caused

796
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:00,980
six rules to be created that actually

797
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,200
find bad actors I've done my job this is

798
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,910
actually pretty amazing I love it when

799
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,098
new rules are created for the stuff that

800
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,259
I run

801
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:12,799
like there was an organization who put

802
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:15,619
in a new rule to find whenever cmd.exe

803
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,900
was run from word eggs that were in word

804
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:23,029
Exe this is awesome

805
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:25,190
or a new process outside of word was

806
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:27,829
created this is awesome I love it

807
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:30,289
and this is a metric that I can't see

808
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:31,969
though as a pen tester this is hard for

809
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:33,769
me metrics should be done for pen

810
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:37,910
testing by the organization not the pen

811
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:39,319
test company asset coverage we're gonna

812
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:43,279
be talking about asset manager in a

813
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:45,109
second but numbers them how many how

814
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:48,339
many people in here think that they have

815
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:54,619
every single asset in their organization

816
00:48:48,339 --> 00:48:59,209
forwarding logs correctly yeah no one

817
00:48:54,619 --> 00:49:01,430
would for that one what coverage of the

818
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:03,919
attack framework do you have this is all

819
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,479
post exploitation stuff time to

820
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,479
detection time to eradication is

821
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:12,279
actually a pretty common one phishing

822
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:12,279
domain that was found before the attack

823
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:24,699
how would you detect a phishing domain

824
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:24,698
before an actual fish comes in I'm sorry

825
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:36,349
the at Transparency logs now one of the

826
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:39,529
things that is interesting that you have

827
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,930
to kind of have had experience with as a

828
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:45,170
defender is that many times attackers

829
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:46,940
will test their domains before they

830
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:51,259
actually send the fish to verify that

831
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:54,979
it'll work so they'll send in a tracking

832
00:49:51,259 --> 00:49:58,729
link or whatever to see if it'll work if

833
00:49:54,979 --> 00:50:02,839
they'll get a ping on it through a user

834
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:03,410
that has no no other detail in the

835
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:06,140
attack

836
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:10,969
so they'll send it to Bob and I use Bob

837
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:12,859
a lot so sorry Bob's they'll send it to

838
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:14,390
Bob he'll go to the domain with a word

839
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,450
thing it'll won't do anything it won't

840
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:18,700
execute anything they won't have a Mac

841
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:21,578
we'll just have a link and see if that

842
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,109
it can go through they'll see that it

843
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:24,880
works in the organization gets through

844
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:26,828
the proxy or whatever other protections

845
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,609
they have and then they send the fish

846
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:32,470
later we've actually caught a fish

847
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:36,910
phishing campaign because of that

848
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:38,919
tracking link weird behavior on a

849
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:42,160
workstation before the attacker made it

850
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:47,320
to fraud anyone ever catch or get got

851
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:50,440
caught by a defender who was who alerted

852
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:54,210
because of some weird traffic or weird

853
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,700
things going on in the system right I

854
00:50:54,210 --> 00:51:02,460
was caught one time after I gotten into

855
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:05,560
an organization because the Oracle admin

856
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,750
that's all he did was watch this Oracle

857
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,250
database and he saw that the Oracle

858
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:13,510
database spiked for a hundred percent

859
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:16,240
for all of 30 seconds because I was

860
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,740
trying to run code he ran down the hall

861
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,379
and I heard this story in the

862
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,390
second-hand but he ran down the hall to

863
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:24,609
the CSO and saying hey we got something

864
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:26,230
weird I have no idea how this worked but

865
00:51:24,609 --> 00:51:28,540
we got something weird on the box and

866
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:36,160
that triggered an investigation that got

867
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:37,839
me caught within maybe 30 minutes most

868
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,149
insiders detected before they stole

869
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:45,400
something I can't tell you a story about

870
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:49,359
this but it has happened we need to

871
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:51,400
start measuring failures as well how

872
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,828
many of you in this room are pen testers

873
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,650
red teamers attack offense raise your

874
00:51:53,829 --> 00:52:00,460
hand how many of you keep your hands

875
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:04,869
raised keep your hands raised if you on

876
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:07,300
your report tell the customer how many

877
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:10,869
times you were detected or found or

878
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:15,460
things that you tried didn't work really

879
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:17,770
that's actually awesome it's really

880
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:19,599
actually encouraging that that is more

881
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,150
of a thing we need to start doing that

882
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,819
more

883
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:26,069
if you tried to get into a Wanda's box

884
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:28,499
or a web server and it didn't work that

885
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:35,720
should be on your report that they are

886
00:52:28,499 --> 00:52:39,899
doing something positive how many of you

887
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:42,029
have seen a talk where a red teamer came

888
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:46,650
up on stage pen tester came up on stage

889
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:49,079
and says this is how I was caught I've

890
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:52,710
done one of those a while ago and that's

891
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:55,230
it it doesn't happen very often and we

892
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:58,289
need to do more of it so if you are in

893
00:52:55,230 --> 00:53:03,960
this room brew con next year that's your

894
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:09,240
talk how did you get caught IT sucks it

895
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:12,480
asset management asset management has

896
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,609
been I t's domain forever usually it's

897
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,700
focused on around the procurement and

898
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:19,619
decommissioning of processes so usually

899
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:25,410
asset management is when they put the

900
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:27,180
sticker on right we as security people

901
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,950
think asset management is all digital

902
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:32,999
it's usually not it's usually just a

903
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:34,169
spreadsheet somewhere cob based assets

904
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:37,049
could appear and disappear within

905
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:40,589
minutes how do you think I t's supposed

906
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:42,299
to track that when DevOps is the new

907
00:53:40,589 --> 00:53:44,788
thing and they're spinning up new

908
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:48,019
instances and taking him down and they

909
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:50,789
get the same type ease all the time

910
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:54,569
anyone ever try asset management on

911
00:53:50,789 --> 00:54:00,930
wireless devices it's not easy so why

912
00:53:54,569 --> 00:54:06,029
are we making it I t's job the security

913
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:08,399
teams usually have all those logs nine

914
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:10,170
times out of ten when I go to a security

915
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,829
organization they're tracking down an IP

916
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:17,400
they can do it within minutes two hours

917
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:20,160
they can find out what the host is yet

918
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:25,739
we're putting it on i.t to do asset

919
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:27,749
management does that make any sense when

920
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:30,440
we have all the logs why are we making a

921
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:30,439
tities job

922
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:38,420
that's the product I want to see at RSA

923
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:41,990
next year something that takes all the

924
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:45,920
logs from security stuff from Splunk

925
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:49,459
from Kafka from all of the other log

926
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:51,980
management stuff and then makes it into

927
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,900
an asset management tool I run something

928
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:57,310
like that at home I want to see it as a

929
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:59,750
product I don't have the time to make it

930
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:02,630
why do we keep on passing the blame to

931
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:05,510
those whose priorities aren't shared

932
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:07,400
with us we do it a lot with like all of

933
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:11,090
these things I've talked about is all us

934
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:14,840
passing the buck passing the blame to

935
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:17,570
someone else so here's all the other

936
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:20,570
things that I got listed from people I

937
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:22,460
asked for online there were there aren't

938
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:27,560
enough InfoSec people you should stay

939
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:29,780
and watch MZ bats talk on how this can

940
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:32,720
be fixed her keynote is going to be

941
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,030
exactly on this topic we don't have

942
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,029
enough time it's because we can't hire

943
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:42,440
four forward people no one else cares

944
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:44,570
about security that's stupid

945
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,460
everyone cares about security right now

946
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:48,970
they just don't care about it in the

947
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:53,920
same way you do

948
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:56,149
InfoSec salespeople are charlatans nope

949
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,250
they're salespeople they're doing their

950
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:03,920
job if they're lying about their product

951
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:05,510
they're actually doing their job they

952
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,860
are salesmen they're trying to get you

953
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:14,140
to buy things we need to realize that

954
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:18,920
that is their job on how they do it

955
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:24,790
InfoSec has so much drama anyone think

956
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:27,650
that InfoSec has drama yeah a lot of it

957
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,110
the best thing you can do is not be an

958
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:34,640
audience because that's the only way

959
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:38,000
drama exists these are focus on edge

960
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,060
cases where the basics is what we suck

961
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,130
at

962
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:48,299
the basics are actually pretty hard so

963
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:50,090
we need to just do our damn jobs ai and

964
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:53,970
ml is the end of the world

965
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:57,690
yep I'm with you I think that I don't

966
00:56:53,970 --> 00:57:03,689
want to ever fight a terminator general

967
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:04,850
apathy again we need to do our jobs we

968
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:08,580
need stop complaining

969
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:11,339
step up and do it perfection required

970
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:15,029
which is good enough a lot of us in this

971
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:18,840
room are probably perfectionists we we

972
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:20,970
get to do security because we try way

973
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:26,100
too hard to figure out a problem that

974
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:30,089
everyone else just walks away from we

975
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:34,740
need to stop making that how we do work

976
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:36,560
or business as well when we when it's

977
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:41,009
good enough it can be good enough and

978
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:44,310
that's me and that's it and thank you so

979
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,520
much for brew con I really appreciate

980
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:51,029
I'm

981
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:51,030
