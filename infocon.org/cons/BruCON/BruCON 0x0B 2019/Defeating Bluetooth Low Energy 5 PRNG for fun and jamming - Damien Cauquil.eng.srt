1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:14,950
thank you so let's talk about again

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,970
Bluetooth maybe some of you know that I

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,369
I'm used to this protocol you know I

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,799
mean just digital security which is a

5
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,210
French IT security company focused on

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,760
the IOT security researcher and the main

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,559
developer BTD Jack which is basically

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,140
beauty Swiss Army knife so we are going

9
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,839
to talk about beauty five so Billy five

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:46,690
is a new version of this Bluetooth

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:49,930
low-energy protocol in design and

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,709
introduced in 2010 2010 as Bluetooth

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:56,140
smart as part of the Bluetooth

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:01,539
specifications are some 4.0 and it has

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:05,470
evolved since then sorry yes version 4.1

16
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:08,979
has been released in 22 2013 dozen 4.2

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:12,330
in two thousand fourteen thousand five

18
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:18,070
in two thousand sixteen and five one in

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:23,110
this year so this is very quickly and

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:26,970
it's quite interesting a lot of security

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,970
features on security mechanisms

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:38,380
any device to exchange key out-of-band

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:48,790
data in the latest version 4.2 with the

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:50,320
EC th this in this mechanism but this

25
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,920
protocol also provides a secure

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,100
connection so this is a built-in feature

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,710
you can use to protect the data exchange

28
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,179
fitted to between two devices so this is

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,469
quite interesting because it's encrypted

30
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,399
and authenticated

31
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:08,978
some basically nobody normally can tap

32
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,980
into a communication or it injects

33
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:16,590
packets in an existing communication

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,750
the last security mechanism but in fact

35
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,670
it's not really a security mechanism

36
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,500
it's something that has been introduced

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:29,640
in BD to improve the what's called the

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,250
coexistence that means as many of you

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:37,589
may know the two men foggy guards bound

40
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,409
with frequencies quickly not used by a

41
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,159
lot of devices and protocols so it's

42
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:46,470
sometimes difficult to make many devices

43
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:50,129
coexist at the same time on this 2.4 gig

44
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,620
at a frequency so this channel selection

45
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:56,129
algorithm is though basically some kind

46
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,620
of natural selection mechanism it's a

47
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:01,530
feature that has been introduced in BA D

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,470
to perform some channel hopping that

49
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,450
makes even complicated so basically it

50
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,900
has been introduced in this protocol to

51
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,298
me to make it more reliable but in fact

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,790
from a security perspective it's also

53
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:20,459
more difficult to tap into an existing

54
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:23,069
connection for instance pretty much

55
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,069
attacked these last shows the first

56
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:29,129
attack that is very easy to perform is a

57
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:33,179
sniffing that means if an attacker is

58
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:36,569
around a device of devices then you can

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,120
stiffen existing connections even if

60
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,530
it's not encrypted of course and by

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,109
sniffing this connection can grab

62
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:49,799
secrets and data until recently this

63
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:52,079
sniffing mechanism of sniffing attack

64
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,900
was only possible with some very

65
00:03:52,079 --> 00:04:03,359
specific tools and it wasn't it didn't

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:06,479
work on a few months ago need to work on

67
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,540
sniffing and sniffer is about to do this

68
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,269
on bd5 but the fact is that this this

69
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,030
tool sniffle can only sniff new

70
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,250
connections because with this protocol

71
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,870
when you connect when you create a

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,238
connection between the device and

73
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,419
another device there is a specific

74
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,520
packet sent

75
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,889
this differ tool is about to capture

76
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,318
this packet and full of the connection

77
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:33,210
even if they cut the communication with

78
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:36,279
Beauty jumps from one channel to another

79
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:39,580
jamming this is something I introduced

80
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,400
last year at Def Con jamming an existing

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,349
data connection it's possible if you are

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,870
synchronized with the existing

83
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:49,930
connection can just inject packets by

84
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,810
exporting abusing a specific feature

85
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,029
called the supervision time mode so I

86
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,759
won't go into the details of this this

87
00:04:55,029 --> 00:05:01,629
jamming attack but something that is

88
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:06,000
feasible and it works on devices for

89
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:08,680
Billy versions of this protocol

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,110
hijacking it's quite the same we are

91
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,020
going to jam a device and then we could

92
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,240
take you we can take control of this

93
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:21,068
existing connection so basically we just

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,009
disconnect the master connected to the

95
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:26,379
staff device and we take its place to

96
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:27,789
keep the connection open and then we can

97
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:34,349
do whatever we want with the slave

98
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:40,688
device so these three attacks it works

99
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:42,639
it works on only on the BD 4.2.2 version

100
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:46,479
of this protocol except for the sniffing

101
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:51,849
which is not possible with bd5 but what

102
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,889
about jamming and hijacking then we are

103
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:59,139
performing the sniffing or jamming

104
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:05,500
attacks or hijacking attacks you need

105
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:08,680
some specific hardware the most used in

106
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,789
this process of the following the first

107
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,789
one on your left

108
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:18,460
so this impetus is a specific area with

109
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:27,610
an SDR that is able to capture packets

110
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:30,219
and process the connections device which

111
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,390
has been sponsored by the BBC in order

112
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:33,580
to teach

113
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,669
English students or UK students how to

114
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:40,450
code but this microbe it includes a very

115
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:43,900
specific chip system and chip recruited

116
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:46,240
by not xml connector which is capable of

117
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,000
communicating with beauty so this is

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,250
something and just abuse in order to

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,250
come to to capture packets on inject

120
00:06:51,250 --> 00:07:00,370
packets at as well and the last one on

121
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:05,020
your right this is something that is

122
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:07,390
used to be sniffing to capture and sniff

123
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,240
basically a beauty five packets and be

124
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,490
four packets as well so if you get one

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:19,150
of these you can pull from attacks and

126
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:22,270
be ID connections only words with micro

127
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,469
bit and this knotek's my connector in

128
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,150
our 51 822 which is basically limited

129
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:36,040
because it has been designed for beauty

130
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:41,469
for only later this is somehow some kind

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:44,560
of issue we may run into with 3535

132
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,540
introduces a lot of new features to so a

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,250
better throughput that means you can

134
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:54,370
send data faster than with beautiful you

135
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,870
can send data flavor with some specific

136
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:03,220
features to 800 feet or 40 meters away

137
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:06,070
so normally beautiful connection is is

138
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,760
working now up to maybe between 20 and

139
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:13,290
40 meters for connection so depending on

140
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,289
the you know under noise

141
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,150
it's also a coexistence so that means

142
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,710
basically is beautiful when you get

143
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,690
during a conference for flu like this

144
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,419
one when you got a lot of people with

145
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:33,429
the really enabled devices when you

146
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,900
may lost your connection or existing

147
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,089
connection or you may experience some

148
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,459
trouble connecting to a device because

149
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,160
there are too many devices in the world

150
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,830
and these devices are interfering with

151
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,050
each other's so this is all sometimes

152
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,420
very difficult with this improved

153
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,640
coexistence it's easier to keep a

154
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,099
connection alive because they improved

155
00:08:51,640 --> 00:09:00,790
this frequency or channel hopping

156
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:03,910
mechanism possible thanks to two new

157
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:10,209
files so the physical communication

158
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:12,370
layer used in so this two new files the

159
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,680
first one is a 2 megabit per second to

160
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,050
me

161
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,479
encoded file which doubles the speed of

162
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,859
beauty if you are you if you are used to

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,810
a beautiful sending data takes some

164
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,820
times and with this new version of

165
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:35,650
beauty 5 and this new file you can send

166
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:37,510
data data faster so another file has

167
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,579
been introduced the ad could it Phi

168
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:45,340
which is a bit messy if you are going to

169
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:49,720
212 look at the packet the side after

170
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,450
but in fact it can send packet further

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,320
but the drawback here that you cannot

172
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:58,450
send packet further with high speed you

173
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,620
need to downgrade the speed to be happy

174
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:04,210
to be able to send packet further so two

175
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:10,530
possibilities here the first one is to

176
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:13,960
have a range x 4 so the up to 240 metals

177
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,939
but you have to sync data had a bit rate

178
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:23,380
of 125 qubit a second you can send it up

179
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:28,980
to 100 meters and so you can send this

180
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:32,559
data 500 500 bit a second so this is

181
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,749
faster but you cannot go

182
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:41,149
as go further with this this Russian

183
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:43,850
fire if you look at the packets the

184
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:46,850
first one at the top is the coded fire

185
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,589
so it's much more complicated and of

186
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,959
course when you are dealing with packets

187
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:53,990
from the air it's difficult to capture

188
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,109
this packet the packet at the bottom of

189
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,559
this style is the legacy big4 packet

190
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,300
it's much simpler if you have a look at

191
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:08,149
this packet you'll see that which is in

192
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,029
fact a succession of zeros and ones an

193
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:14,179
access address the axis of Ursula 32-bit

194
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:17,629
value that identifies a link between two

195
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:19,220
devices so this is something the ties

196
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:25,249
they are both devices when the

197
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:27,559
connection is created we are going to

198
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:31,149
send from one device to another and I

199
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:41,689
also see a checksum that is used to

200
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:45,079
check if the connection is with the

201
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:49,549
improved distance this is the key point

202
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:53,118
in my talk money when you are creating a

203
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:55,699
connection with Scotty

204
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:59,899
you know the channel selection algorithm

205
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:04,549
number one which is this channel

206
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:08,230
selection mechanism basically uses some

207
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:11,350
kind of contour to compute dynamically

208
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,059
the channel number you are going to use

209
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,799
for the next so we are going from one

210
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,679
channel to another with this

211
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:21,679
mathematical sequence so this is very

212
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:25,069
basic and you get the previous channel

213
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:28,129
you add some some value could increment

214
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:30,610
so this is a value set by the master who

215
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:33,259
creates the connection and then you

216
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,569
compute the mad Savi server and you get

217
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:38,569
the channel index you are going to put

218
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,529
to you for the next channel so since

219
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,348
it's pretty basic this

220
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,659
explains also right in the room a very

221
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:50,489
crowded area there are lot of collisions

222
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:52,589
on this of packets so they decided to

223
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:55,799
permit a new channel selection algorithm

224
00:12:52,589 --> 00:13:02,129
based on the PNG pseudo-random number

225
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:05,669
generator and this channel selection

226
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:09,479
algorithm is more random and in fact

227
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:14,098
this statistical statistical area

228
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:16,139
improve the existence of devices if you

229
00:13:14,099 --> 00:13:18,479
look at the packets sent by the devices

230
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,699
that advertise and this is the case of

231
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:23,539
most of the beauty devices there is a

232
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:27,269
bit that has been had added to the

233
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:29,759
recalled the CH cell bit and if these

234
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,589
bits equals one then your device

235
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,929
supports the new channel selection

236
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:37,139
algorithms we can tell when the device

237
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:39,478
advertises if this device supports this

238
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,839
new channel selection algorithm or if it

239
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:45,509
does not so this is quite interesting so

240
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,549
just to sum it up what are the

241
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,979
consequences regarding existing attacks

242
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:55,289
so we got a new channel selection

243
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:57,569
algorithm that changes drastically the

244
00:13:55,289 --> 00:14:02,609
device perhaps from one channel to

245
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:06,949
another so basically these new channels

246
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:06,949
you can sequence of six

247
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:14,459
65,536 different channels rather than 37

248
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:16,649
for the previous version so sniffing new

249
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,459
prediction is still possible if you

250
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:22,079
capture the connection request sent to

251
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,029
create the connection to initiate the

252
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,779
connection then you get everything you

253
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:30,449
need to start from immune existing

254
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,299
connection because obviously the master

255
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:35,639
sends everything required every

256
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,949
parameters that are required to follow

257
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:42,599
the connection for the state so if you

258
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:45,319
are when the connection is created then

259
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:47,720
you can get everything you need

260
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,740
for decoration so this is what sniffle

261
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,769
does but we won't be able to jam or

262
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,079
hijack b85 devices because previous

263
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,389
attacks such as jamming and hijacking

264
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,609
are based on the previous channel

265
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:05,089
selection algorithm so the main question

266
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:13,449
is are being attacks dead is it possible

267
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:13,449
nowadays on the future two devices the

268
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:21,050
short answer is maybe yes when I have to

269
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,889
look at the specifications stumbled upon

270
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,250
the baby 5 PNG this pseudo-random number

271
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,250
generator

272
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:34,519
it looks very nice you know first of all

273
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,790
it uses what it's calling the

274
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,069
specifications a channel identifier and

275
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,439
it's this channel manage for your

276
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:43,849
interviews that is as a seed of this PNG

277
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,519
so this is quite interesting

278
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,380
this plan must be designed to be very

279
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,000
easy to implement because you know you

280
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,399
get to implement this in very tiny

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,100
devices with small power computational

282
00:15:52,399 --> 00:16:02,240
power so this is in fact so based on

283
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:05,329
additional specifications so this is

284
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,949
something very easy to implement and of

285
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:13,160
course if your channel is very crowded

286
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:15,109
then you can decide to not to use this

287
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,050
channel and keep at the other working

288
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,149
this is a very specific feature of the

289
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,620
beauty protocol I will cover this in the

290
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:26,029
store but this is something you have to

291
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:29,360
keep in mind when you go through the

292
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:32,810
specs is just a simple calculation based

293
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,569
on the XS addresses the 32-bit values

294
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:37,579
and after the preamble so this is

295
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:40,910
something that is broadcasted this is

296
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:45,050
publicly this is very interesting

297
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:47,329
because this this value then this

298
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:51,560
channel identifier is used in

299
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:53,189
combination with this mal rattled my own

300
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,439
stands for multiply

301
00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:03,660
but which is basically the three steps

302
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:10,490
of this this this routine only once the

303
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:13,020
process so we're getting put on the Left

304
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,660
which is basically the number of

305
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,930
channels you have jumped on the given

306
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:23,010
time the identifier which is the access

307
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:27,990
address like so I didn't specify to be

308
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:31,230
more specific the just beat 0 to 15 X or

309
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:37,100
beat 16 to 31 so this is very easy to

310
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:40,920
compute so first step is extraordinary

311
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,490
permutation then first in a.m. between

312
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:47,280
second and am so permutation

313
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:50,550
Semyon Expo and you get your random

314
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:54,899
number what is supposed to be a random

315
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:58,020
number and this is using the channel

316
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,810
selection algorithm number 2 so this is

317
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,990
basically a process to compute the next

318
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,629
channel and that we are going to talk to

319
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,810
in order to keep the connection alive so

320
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:13,460
first one first input is a counter the

321
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:17,210
channel identifier then we get this

322
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:22,070
generation routine then we get the

323
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,070
number and we compute the deck channel

324
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,370
interesting you know and I wasn't alone

325
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,090
when I play from this research so that

326
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:39,870
Matthew green which run on cryptographer

327
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,510
also supported this exact algorithm in

328
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,229
the specs

329
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:47,690
so yeah I said I got something and of

330
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,500
course you all know that the first rule

331
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,720
in cryptography including ing designs is

332
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,570
don't roll your own you don't create

333
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,530
your own PNG you don't create your own

334
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:05,928
encryption algorithm so in this specific

335
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:07,910
country well sounds bad and I see also

336
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,040
some flaws here the first one is that

337
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:14,210
the channel identifiers public as I say

338
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,629
previously so this is a 16-bit value you

339
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,790
can compute based from the echo students

340
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:22,220
so we know this we are going to hijack

341
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,320
or channel connection we need this

342
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:31,040
access address value so we know which

343
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:37,040
net identifier next value as an input in

344
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:40,940
this normally when you implement this

345
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,639
kind of for pure energy system you can't

346
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:46,400
use some internal states this is a

347
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,100
specific before heating from the outside

348
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:54,169
and this before evolves from time to

349
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:58,790
time and then so if you want to break

350
00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:15,530
this you need to guess the internal

351
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:17,240
state if you look at the function this

352
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:19,940
is something a black box function that

353
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,790
takes a known value at the counter to

354
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,549
generate sixty five thousand and five

355
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:28,280
hundred thirty six different values for

356
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:32,418
a given channel amplifier so this is

357
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:38,780
something constant and this sequence is

358
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:41,120
fixed so basically perspective this is

359
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:47,210
something that can be broken because you

360
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:50,469
are going to rip all of this 65 manage

361
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,470
to know maybe

362
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:59,530
so I consider that China antiviral is

363
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:04,220
known since it's based on excess address

364
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:06,740
with a 16-bit value which is a contra so

365
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,860
what can we do with that if we can

366
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:13,270
figure out where the connection is in

367
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:16,879
this sequence of 65,000 these values

368
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,950
then at a specific time then we can

369
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,400
synchronize with the connection and then

370
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:31,930
sniff jump under so this is quite

371
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:35,390
interesting to break this branch so as

372
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:38,030
we are external we don't have access to

373
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,770
this counter value so we have to guess

374
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,510
it and the only way we can get

375
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,050
information from an existing connection

376
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:48,110
is to listen on a specific channel limit

377
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:52,040
for packets were to be received so I can

378
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:54,770
only which time I got a packet on the

379
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,500
channel and of course if I measure the

380
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,139
time spent the time between two packets

381
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,030
on two different channels I can measure

382
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,480
the time spent between these two packets

383
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:10,940
so this is two information I can get and

384
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:13,040
I can use to break this P&G the protocol

385
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,020
site for this is to know what is called

386
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,060
the hop interval the open travel is

387
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,900
basically the time spent by the device

388
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,960
on the channel so let's consider that we

389
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:28,340
know this video for this attack so our

390
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:31,280
goal is to try to to recover the counter

391
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:38,840
value at a given time so I started to

392
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:41,540
think about an attack and thieves used

393
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,939
to compute prime numbers you know you

394
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,129
get these matrix you cross every numbers

395
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,700
and do you animate each candidate and

396
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:53,680
you the only candidate left our prime

397
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,680
numbers so this is quite the same

398
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:56,950
and we divide this by the open term

399
00:23:52,630 --> 00:24:01,090
value if n is greater than 1 that means

400
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:03,340
my candidate is not the conservator so

401
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:07,720
this is quite easy to just eliminate

402
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:10,540
this candidate and keep the others and

403
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,450
we go like this in the sequence we are

404
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,860
previously generated so we are going to

405
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:22,450
look for channels in sequence with a gap

406
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:26,490
of and based on this we are only going

407
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:28,690
to keep the indexes that basically the

408
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,420
value of the country used to generate

409
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,420
these these channels so by doing this we

410
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:44,350
used to generate this pattern and we're

411
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:49,570
going to by doing this we can do it

412
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:52,270
again and after this we left with single

413
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:56,379
candidate and this candidate is the

414
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:59,639
channel the Condor when we started the

415
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,640
attack at T 0

416
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,569
[Music]

417
00:25:16,150 --> 00:26:29,849
[Music]

418
00:25:17,869 --> 00:26:33,989
so this is a but we need to know because

419
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:51,599
all of this is based on and this is

420
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:54,080
something and you are going to capture

421
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,580
various packets with different hubs

422
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,249
first ones let's say it will be a five

423
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,590
hubs the second one two hubs and so on

424
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:05,580
so the time span between this this is

425
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,879
obviously a multiple

426
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:12,149
of the Hopf interval so if you use the

427
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:14,939
GCD you just to complete the widow who

428
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:17,309
greatest common denominator then we can

429
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:21,210
get Mathematica Mathematica me this

430
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:24,210
video so you got enough measures then

431
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:30,779
you can deduce this this open top so

432
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:34,950
again I simulated this this system as

433
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:40,109
you can see after the 5 of 5 meters or 6

434
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:46,609
meters or something very lot of tests to

435
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:50,279
see if values of identifiers encounter

436
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:53,220
as you can see if you only takes 5

437
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:58,859
minutes you get a 95 percent of success

438
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:02,340
rate this is this is pretty good success

439
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:05,309
you need to make 10 meters so it takes

440
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:10,609
sometimes to do these videos but in fact

441
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:13,769
it works and the maximum time required 8

442
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:16,769
seconds so this is a few minutes to

443
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,419
recover this value difficult when you

444
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:23,639
are attacking your live device you know

445
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:25,440
you have to follow people to keep in

446
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:30,258
mind of the devices so this is sometimes

447
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:38,249
difficult to to do anyway so this the

448
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:40,859
control mechanism design as my attack so

449
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:44,429
once I implemented everything in person

450
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:46,649
everything was so much carry working so

451
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:49,830
next step is to go in the real life

452
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:53,090
let's go into implementing some some

453
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,730
attacks this attacks on a rope device

454
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:59,580
so I started working on Amazon looking

455
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,190
for beautiful enabled devices I found a

456
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,949
lot of them but in fact they are not be

457
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,760
85 compatible this is just some Chinese

458
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,250
runnin Krabs

459
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,789
putting a lot of be 85 mentions in the

460
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:17,909
description just to attract people and

461
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:19,129
mix herbs at this time there is no

462
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:26,190
really

463
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:32,399
beauty 5 compatible device devices I

464
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:42,419
found only 4.2 4.1 depending on the

465
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:47,760
devices so basically I had no device not

466
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:52,230
i canítö a lot of deaf kids development

467
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,480
boards can buy inst use to test your

468
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:57,630
setup with a beautiful device so I got

469
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:02,639
the firmware from the SDK I compact this

470
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:05,039
far more put this family on board one is

471
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:08,039
the slave device the other master device

472
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,350
and it uses the channel selection not

473
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:12,240
good and about 2 so this is something

474
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:16,860
that it's quite interesting because we

475
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,429
are going to test this tag and of course

476
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:22,678
I started to improve the beetle track

477
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:24,929
because you know I'm used to it and know

478
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,649
how to develop this formula so this is

479
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:31,049
easier for me to implement this so I

480
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,629
modified better Jack to compute the open

481
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:37,379
interval mapping capital value while

482
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:40,500
mapping channels and also this GCD based

483
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:44,250
technique to recover this value and I

484
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,039
started my attacker and you can see at

485
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:49,940
the bottom of the of the screen I get

486
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,330
the carpenter and value so the GCD

487
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:57,180
computation was put well so that's great

488
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,030
yeah first step done we got the hop into

489
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,920
a video next step next step we are going

490
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,540
to implement our sieve attack we are

491
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,090
going to eliminate and we could persuade

492
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,430
candidate in order to intercept the

493
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:11,520
communication so I started implemented

494
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,090
this attack and the first one went

495
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,879
pretty well

496
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:23,240
I went from 65,000 put 20 days to only

497
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:37,740
250 candidates the first pass that

498
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:53,610
second pass because I did the same this

499
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:56,370
night with my code took some time to

500
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,830
compute something and then get this

501
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:07,800
synchronized from the connection we are

502
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:09,990
looking for so this moment so I wanted

503
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,870
to get it working to serve this problem

504
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:20,130
I moved from a approach which is

505
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:22,350
basically to a pattern motion matching

506
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:27,110
algorithm so we are going to do first a

507
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:31,230
lot of measures which wendy synchronized

508
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:33,120
micro by 2 micro bits or device and then

509
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,900
based on these measures we are going to

510
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:41,219
deduce the value of the counter so if

511
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:45,000
you take 10 years then you can deduce

512
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:54,630
this this counter and the value you are

513
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:57,330
waiting for first step we got the

514
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,890
internal next step we got the control

515
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,919
volume yeah

516
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:07,100
so normally everything goes yeah that's

517
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:07,100
plan then

518
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:49,710
you know 65,000 candidates but on this

519
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,640
tiny system-on-chip

520
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:59,720
it takes some time to do so and I doing

521
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:01,770
this when I exited I was late and

522
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,660
certain hopes late

523
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,240
so that means when I started the sequin

524
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:11,850
to Detective packet and synchronize when

525
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,590
the device was 13 hopes ahead so no way

526
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:19,080
I could synchronize with the with this

527
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:23,070
connection so I fixed this draft and the

528
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,750
former I'm looking just 13 hopes her

529
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:27,030
head and I get the connection

530
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,659
I get the packet at the exact time I was

531
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:35,190
waiting for it and it worked so let's

532
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:37,919
see what happens with this so I'm going

533
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,440
to capture a connection in order to

534
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,480
speed up the video I specified the

535
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,710
channel map and so on so if you are

536
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,290
wondering what are what are the

537
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:52,380
parameters in the code 9 so we are going

538
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:55,050
to the internal control which is the

539
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:59,450
pure energy counter so you can see it

540
00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:06,960
can take some some seconds to to get

541
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:08,069
this value yeah this is the fun part of

542
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,990
the team you know when you're using

543
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:15,320
video I did that edited this video to

544
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:27,540
make it faster when in fact it very soon

545
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:30,510
come on ten seconds left and then we are

546
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,160
synchronized and capturing data with

547
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:38,990
this channel section I go from number

548
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,990
two so pretty cool we got this working

549
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,560
jamming so now that we are synchronized

550
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,770
with the device we're going to mess with

551
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,520
it

552
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:58,040
and to mess with it we need to be at st.

553
00:35:50,520 --> 00:36:01,320
packets the system as you can see or the

554
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:05,370
connection most but in fact I also get

555
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:09,300
the video it's maybe the world demo in

556
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:11,880
video I made to end it because there

557
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:15,900
were no different devices at there so

558
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,030
this is a deaf bowl with an LED I'm

559
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,220
going to show you explain to you what

560
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:24,210
happens but if I don't expect a very

561
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:30,080
amazing demo like me putting some sex

562
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:35,130
story or something like this okay just

563
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:40,680
to this I implemented the journey

564
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:45,830
process jamming attack on this bottom

565
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,830
right hand corner you got the video feed

566
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:52,440
so domine I'm already connected with my

567
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:59,030
master device to this that is def Bob

568
00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:05,100
and when the broad get disconnected LED

569
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:06,210
goes on that tells the connection has

570
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,279
been lost

571
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,190
and it rates a new connection but the

572
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,470
master also detects this disconnection

573
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,720
and create a new connection so we're

574
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:18,930
going to see that so by doing this we

575
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,129
have the same attack - we get the

576
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:28,799
internet contour again with this this

577
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:32,640
technique I created so I got normally we

578
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:44,070
would get the value of this again

579
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:56,089
sometime sorry for that it's impossible

580
00:37:44,070 --> 00:38:03,330
to do it at a conference these flips and

581
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:08,009
gets new connection so just amazing but

582
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:10,230
in fact this attack works it works the

583
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,300
hijacking attack normally works but I

584
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:17,280
got an issue with the death ball that

585
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:21,030
means the firmware is somehow touching

586
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,740
when you're going to to jump it detects

587
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,330
very quickly that the condition is lost

588
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,069
and this is not good for hijacking

589
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,160
because we expect the device to have

590
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,530
some kind of timeout we can exploit you

591
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,210
need some time through this connect the

592
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:38,339
master detect that the connection has

593
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:40,140
been cut and then take some other

594
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:43,349
connections and this is a problem here

595
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:48,029
but in fact hijacking would work exactly

596
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:50,640
the same I need devices to you know to

597
00:38:48,030 --> 00:39:00,420
show people that it's possible to hijack

598
00:38:50,640 --> 00:39:03,420
with with b5 so the two of be jack so

599
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,570
for those of you interested in giving

600
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,870
you a shot at this beautiful German and

601
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:13,280
hijacker this is possible to do so

602
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:16,259
install this this tool with a peep the

603
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,820
even work because the people has only

604
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:23,490
the 1.3 Russian 1.3 of these this tool

605
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:27,930
you get to clone the repository and then

606
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:31,680
and instead it yourself when I did that

607
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:34,500
because it's experimental I need to test

608
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:39,710
it mercilessly a lot of devices in order

609
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:42,690
to claim that my tool is working with

610
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,150
devices so if you want to give it a shot

611
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:47,300
test will be ID 5 devices you may own or

612
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:52,230
you may develop then use this version

613
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:57,780
2.0 available on github so if you wants

614
00:39:52,230 --> 00:40:06,980
to to conclude this presentation options

615
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:11,360
5 and especially its PNG this is somehow

616
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:18,780
fun to me we can you know we can prove

617
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:20,400
in fact obviously there are some flows

618
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,670
that can be exploited to be able to

619
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,370
sniff a jam or hijack such a degenerate

620
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,830
e fire on the counter which is basically

621
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:33,750
something you can recover by monitoring

622
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:36,390
and existing connection just to make

623
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:45,300
everything you know mine context with

624
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:48,240
the then this has just been introduced

625
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,460
to improve coexistence that means they

626
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,490
expect the guys who created this

627
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:57,990
protocol did not expect some kind of

628
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:59,970
security improvement from this they were

629
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,459
expecting to improve the coexistence

630
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:06,000
that means to be to be able to put a lot

631
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,250
of devices in the same room and unlike

632
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,900
the before version of this protocol to

633
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,050
be able to make them communicate without

634
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,210
any issues so in fact this is not really

635
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:18,010
a security mechanism a secure features

636
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,530
that has been introduced in bd5 just

637
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:25,690
something make net return to make

638
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:27,760
everybody lives easier with baby it has

639
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:30,160
also been designed to be easy to

640
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,740
implement on a very tiny devices and

641
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,339
very low-power views I'm serious

642
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,669
so basically they are doing the but in

643
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,650
fact don't expect this PNG - yeah -

644
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:45,250
block P security people from tapping

645
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,200
into devices this is for developers this

646
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,520
is my words for the ability developers

647
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,980
out there and I don't know if you there

648
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,470
are any but anyway if you are using be

649
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,740
85 or be 84 or something like this

650
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:59,200
use the security features it's provided

651
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,169
by the protocol itself and as we can see

652
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,109
as we saw during the last years maybe

653
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:07,030
90% of the devices are still using

654
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:13,900
unprotected on unsecure ability

655
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:16,360
connections so that the way the jamming

656
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,220
and hijacking attacks work because if

657
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,740
you don't use this secure connection

658
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,680
when anybody can tap into your internal

659
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,049
connections leave your data and John new

660
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,319
devices and hijack your devices very

661
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,320
easily

662
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,129
for the future of this research it could

663
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:39,470
be interesting to you a new version of

664
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:42,710
not xml conduct or system and chips

665
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:46,189
which which is basically another 50 to

666
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:48,829
80 40 that provides everything required

667
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,210
for the two new files there are still a

668
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:53,180
lot of work to probably to talk to this

669
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:55,640
platform because it's it's quite similar

670
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:59,440
you know because it's a same vendor but

671
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,440
in fact you get to refactor the code and

672
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:06,250
luckiest banks I don't know if you guys

673
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:06,250
I've heard about this guy Marcus banks

674
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:18,700
logitech unifying bangles and devices

675
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:20,810
such as mice and keyboards and this guy

676
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,569
already developed or some kind of

677
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:27,349
firmware to toughen these tags on this

678
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:29,810
and I have 52 840 chip so this is

679
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:33,500
something I can may be used to improve

680
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:35,349
bTW I can make it more reliable for b85

681
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:38,510
MVD for connections

682
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:42,079
so thanks backers be sure watch this

683
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,030
video maybe here anyway so this is

684
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,869
something me you can I'm going to do in

685
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:51,770
the future if if I have time to do so in

686
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:54,829
order to make this tune available

687
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:59,780
I also put research materials such as

688
00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:01,400
this script you found in the videos if

689
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,500
you want to have a look at it if you

690
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,980
want to try out to test it or to

691
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,990
experiment with this be 85 new channel

692
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,380
selection algorithm it's available also

693
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:16,160
in Geeta I also have some kind of die

694
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,160
harder tests just to try to evaluate the

695
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,890
PNG you know

696
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:32,480
PNG web business but if yeah it's free

697
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:35,060
if you have any questions I don't know

698
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:47,460
should get Mike and maybe

699
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:53,269
do it outside Oh No thank you very much

700
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:53,269
[Applause]
