1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,559
hello so yeah the speech will be about

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,840
the operationalization of attack

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:16,930
framework for security operation centers

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,509
and today I will present to you the

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,490
atomic fred coverage project which is

6
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:24,550
free open source available on the github

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,150
and i'm working on it with few of my

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,369
friends so who am i who we are

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:35,309
my name is mateo I'm working as incident

10
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:38,019
responder in theater important

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,059
originally this presentation supposed to

12
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,390
be conducted together with Daniel Lucas

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,339
Lasky who work as threat detection head

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,769
of fraud detection in syndicator in

15
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:51,489
Russia unfortunately he was not able to

16
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:54,909
to get here so I will present along and

17
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:59,229
presentation will be a bit shorter and

18
00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:01,420
we also have two other colleagues Jakob

19
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:03,879
Benson who works as Fred detection

20
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,700
specialist in theatre Poland and Mikhail

21
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:09,929
axon of working as automation team lead

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,930
in business Russia

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,980
okay so first question please raise your

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,700
hand if you are familiar with

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:22,070
intelligent driven defense okay I can

26
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:28,189
see some hands so

27
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:31,859
basically it has really straightforward

28
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:34,320
assumptions know your enemy if you want

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,579
to be able to defend yourself you have

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,829
to know how adversary operates what are

31
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,309
their strengths and what are their

32
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,158
weaknesses it is very popular in

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,590
military I'll taught in cybersecurity it

34
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,299
wasn't that popular a few a few years

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:56,700
back from now but it changed when in my

36
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,340
2000 in May 2015

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,459
my true corporate corporation released

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,239
the attack framework which operates

39
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:12,030
based on on this approach and is the

40
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,769
threat model so I'm pretty sure that

41
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,769
most of you guys are familiar with this

42
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:20,040
one but just to be sure that we are on

43
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,069
the same page more or less that's how it

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,950
looks like this is the enterprise matrix

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,660
from from this framework and we have the

46
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,980
twelve columns which represent the

47
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,500
tactical objective and inside desserts

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,018
we have the technical implementation to

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,660
achieve the tactical goals so quite

50
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:43,560
simple columns are the tactics in sauce

51
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,970
we have the techniques that's how simple

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,549
technique looks like this is

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,709
exfiltration over alternative protocol

54
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:52,260
we have the description some of the

55
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:55,170
example of usage and high level

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,989
description of mitigation and and

57
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,230
detection for this specific technique

58
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:03,450
however there are some problems mostly

59
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,298
opera and nationalization problems so

60
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,488
description from my terror attack is to

61
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:11,540
high level it's not actionable so you

62
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:15,900
cannot simply take this page pass it to

63
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,849
to your team and ask for these guys

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,020
could you detect these activities or

65
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:23,320
could you mitigate it

66
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,990
the second thing is kind of consequence

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,870
of the first problem which is lack of

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,210
ability to explain requirements so it

69
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,160
does not provide us the information what

70
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:37,540
exactly we have to configure how to

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,700
configure it and where to configure it

72
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,190
another problem is reporting to the

73
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,089
leadership so what is the current

74
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,880
coverage

75
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:50,860
what is the progression when when when

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,900
you decide to work with the might of

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:04:01,570
attack framework so the problem of

78
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:04,480
coverage is currently in the community

79
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,489
there is no like common definition of

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,470
what the coverage really is when you can

81
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:13,240
say that you already covered the

82
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:18,970
technique and you can go to the next one

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:21,280
so our view on this looks like this so

84
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,310
basically there are four pillars which

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,799
have to be fulfilled to be able to say

86
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,800
that yes we are covering the technique

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,400
those are the simulation detection

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:39,630
response and mitigation and only if you

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,630
have the entities related to to those

90
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,750
pr's you can say that yes I am

91
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:51,789
conferring the the technique or at least

92
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,530
the known usage of of the technique so

93
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:58,390
we implemented this kind of the approach

94
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:03,719
but we want to build a tool which will

95
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:08,020
allow us to do do more things in an

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,390
automatical way so less less manual job

97
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,799
more automation and we set a few

98
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,159
requirements for ourselves

99
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,550
first of all plain text files this has

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,100
some historical reasons when we

101
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,730
initially implemented this approach we

102
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,199
were using the confluence for storing

103
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,960
the

104
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,960
knowledgebase and it's required from us

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,030
a lot of manual job when we when we are

106
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,198
editing something or when we were adding

107
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:41,799
the new entities so we wanted to make it

108
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:45,219
simple and as I said we wanted to make

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:50,219
it as automatic as automated as as

110
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:53,889
possible so automate almost everything

111
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:57,460
so yeah regarding those four pillars we

112
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:00,189
have the entities which are related to

113
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,169
2000 and I would like to quickly show

114
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:05,199
you what we choose or what we've built

115
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,419
that for those purposes so when when it

116
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,849
comes to the simulation we decided to

117
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,878
use atomic reading project this project

118
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:15,878
was already mentioned yesterday so this

119
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,849
is the tool for emulation of of the

120
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,789
adversary what's cool is that it also

121
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:23,589
has the execution frameworks so you can

122
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,779
define the list of the tests which you

123
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:27,550
would like to execute and quickly

124
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:32,889
execute all of them on the test system

125
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:37,560
to check how to check what you are able

126
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,560
to detect or what you can mitigate

127
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,509
that's how simple trigger looks like so

128
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,699
we have the mapping to miter attack

129
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,620
which is really important for us and we

130
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,080
have the test which consists basically

131
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,569
of the commands which will be executed

132
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,930
on the test systems so once we are able

133
00:06:52,569 --> 00:07:00,069
to emulate the adversary we would like

134
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:03,339
to detect it and for this we decided to

135
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:05,560
use the Sigma format Sigma is a generic

136
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,659
signature format for DCM systems and

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,529
it's getting really popular right now

138
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:13,479
and the concept is quite simple so there

139
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,669
is the Sigma format in which you are

140
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,830
serving the rows and there is the Sigma

141
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:20,620
converter which can convert those rules

142
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,258
into the queries for multiple search

143
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:26,870
systems like elastic search Splunk

144
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:29,630
karada arcsight basically many of them

145
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,690
and that's how it looks like we have the

146
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:36,100
roll with with the simple description we

147
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:39,590
have D tagging for the Matic attack

148
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,540
matrix and we have the conditions which

149
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,719
are necessarily to match for the rule to

150
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:47,120
trigger on some specific event so now we

151
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,120
need a data which could be analyzed by

152
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,130
by this rule and for to store

153
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,199
information about about the data we

154
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,979
decided to create the date and

155
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:01,280
identities again simple Yamla format we

156
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:04,070
have here the example of of the log the

157
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,820
fields which are inside where it comes

158
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:11,419
from so what is the source and there is

159
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:15,710
another problem because a lot of logs

160
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:19,070
are not are not produced by default so

161
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,739
you have to configure something and to

162
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,580
track this information you also have the

163
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,260
reference to logging policy here and

164
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,299
that's how logging policy looks like so

165
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:34,270
a sample step by step configuration what

166
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:37,669
has to be to be what has to be

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:42,500
configured and where to to be able to

168
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:44,390
collect the the data point in terms to

169
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,730
security operations center especially if

170
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,870
in the managed service providers you may

171
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,250
want to track what is what you are what

172
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,770
we are collecting and what is

173
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,220
implemented per customers so another

174
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,260
simple entity when which you can use for

175
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,570
tracking and when it comes to the

176
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,120
internal security teams this might be

177
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,510
not external customer but some group of

178
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,209
the hosts or even some specific some

179
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,640
specific server if you want to go

180
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:17,630
further you may want to enrich the data

181
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:21,890
and to store information how to do this

182
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,529
we also have the enrichment and it is so

183
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,029
again simple description requirements

184
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:31,370
for the enrichment if it adds new new

185
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,870
fields they are also listed here and the

186
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,910
config which is needed for the

187
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,130
enrichment will be also presented inside

188
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,650
such entity

189
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,950
when it comes to the response part we

190
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:48,000
are using the small response actions

191
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:53,280
with the workflow what to do in case of

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,070
of the response and response plates are

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,230
built with with those response actions

194
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,810
so they are just small building blocks

195
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,820
which are used here so you can reuse

196
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:06,630
same response action in multiple play

197
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,190
books and if you will update one of your

198
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:12,830
response actions all of the play books

199
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:16,080
will be also updated and also some other

200
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:21,920
information here like tax information

201
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:26,880
about the severity PLP PAP and so on

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:29,459
okay so know as that's how our tool

203
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,860
looks like under the hood so the

204
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,620
entities in the young format which I

205
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,500
just showed you are ingested into the

206
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,020
Python script there with some black

207
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:46,380
magic everything is mapped to each other

208
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:48,930
and calculated and the dependent

209
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,280
dependencies between the entities are

210
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:55,489
calculated and then this data is

211
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,689
exported to multiple format which can be

212
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,250
analyzed or ingested into other

213
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:05,310
platforms and following our make it

214
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:09,710
simple principle we decide to use simple

215
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:12,900
Linux make utility for orchestrating the

216
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:16,280
the usage of our tour so we found simple

217
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,020
command most of the things will be

218
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:22,050
generated so the underlying sub modules

219
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,260
like Sigma or atomic read team will be

220
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,479
updated and since those are added as

221
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,980
these sub modules if you have your own

222
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,080
locale fork of those projects we've some

223
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,600
built in house rules or all the triggers

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,210
you can attach your own fork of those

225
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,970
project it will set up the confluence

226
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:45,709
and the markdown repository and push

227
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,329
data there as for the knowledge

228
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,339
and the confluence is not the

229
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:52,729
requirement exactly the same data will

230
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:54,560
be presented in both of those formats it

231
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,019
will create the attack navigator

232
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,888
profiles which can be further analyzed

233
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:03,410
the playbooks will be exported to d hive

234
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:06,709
templates and i will show to you how it

235
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,870
looks like in the moment and the data

236
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,619
will be also exported to elasticsearch

237
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:17,269
index so you can do further analysis

238
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:19,540
inside the Cabana ok and time for small

239
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,540
demo

240
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:34,410
okay so yeah once you will upload all of

241
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,689
the data to the confluence and as I

242
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,870
mentioned same data can be reviewed in

243
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:44,010
the markdown files you will get the tree

244
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:48,360
with folders for all of the entities and

245
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,270
their human readable in the human

246
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,370
readable format so let's take a look at

247
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:59,670
sample detection rule how it looks like

248
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:02,850
here this one okay so we have the table

249
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:06,240
with the metadata and all the links here

250
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:10,820
are let's say clickable so they will

251
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,649
take you straight to 2d related entities

252
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,430
so this can be easily used as the

253
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:19,800
knowledge base and in the bottom you

254
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,779
will find the original unmodified Sigma

255
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,180
rule and generate that queries and this

256
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,279
part is configurable so if you are if

257
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,739
you are using one system but not another

258
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,439
and you want to save some resources in

259
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,709
the configuration you can choose in

260
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,290
which queries you you are interested

261
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:42,540
okay so just for demo purposes here we

262
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:46,560
can go to the page with with the date I

263
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,560
need that again nicely rendered role

264
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,680
example here so you can pass this page

265
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:56,510
to see empty more data engineers to show

266
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:00,510
them what exactly they should expect and

267
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:03,390
link to the login policy so with one

268
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,110
click you have exact configuration what

269
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:10,579
to do to collect such data okay and

270
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,579
let's go back to 2d

271
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,800
the detection rule for a moment here it

272
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,250
will also automatically create the link

273
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:25,779
to the atomic red team test for for this

274
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:29,730
technique and in current version it's

275
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:33,189
it's only matched based on the technique

276
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:35,649
so it might appear that inside the

277
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,279
trigger there will be no actual trigger

278
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:42,100
for for this rule but since my two

279
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,740
recently announced the sub modules but

280
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,470
not sub modules but sub techniques we

281
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,709
believe that with these sub techniques

282
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:53,709
it will be much easier to to assign the

283
00:14:50,709 --> 00:15:01,089
correct triggers so here is the human

284
00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:03,369
readable with some HTML tags here's the

285
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:05,410
human readable version of the trigger so

286
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,540
you can you have the quick access to

287
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:11,829
document if you would like to perform

288
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,779
some kind of of the testing okay and

289
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,120
let's take a look how sample response

290
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,819
playbook looks like so again similar

291
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,839
fashion nicely rendered table or of the

292
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:25,569
links are clickable here here but the

293
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,709
response actions will be also rendered

294
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:32,199
in the bottom so it's a good for the

295
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:34,839
knowledge base but such playbooks are

296
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:36,819
not really actionable so we are also

297
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,769
exporting them in the format which might

298
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:44,920
be imported to the hive platform if this

299
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:46,990
is the case management platform it was

300
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,930
built by incident responders for

301
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,029
incident responders and it's pretty

302
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,279
awesome it has a lot of possibilities

303
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:57,810
for the automation and integration with

304
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:00,850
another projects like cortex or or Mis

305
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,880
so if you are out and it's free and open

306
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,529
source so if you are looking for a good

307
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,389
internet management platform you may

308
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:12,760
want to take a look at this one okay so

309
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:17,550
here we can import

310
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,550
the template which was created by ADC

311
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:25,110
okay and all of the response actions now

312
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,760
will be just a tasks here and

313
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,510
additionally the information about

314
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,960
severity and so on will be pre-populated

315
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:41,819
here so if we will create the sample

316
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:41,820
case based on this template just test

317
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,190
case yeah so that's how guys now looks

318
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,680
like we have the description and in the

319
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,779
tasks all of the response actions are

320
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,029
are the tasks so you can assign it to

321
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,970
yourself or assigned to someone from

322
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:02,000
from your team and start working on case

323
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,920
having the pre build that template for

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,049
it okay and when it comes to the

325
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,939
measuring the coverage I've mentioned

326
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,579
that we are exporting data to the attack

327
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:16,130
navigator profile so little is available

328
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:17,990
on the internet but the code is also

329
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,610
published on the github so you can spin

330
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:26,439
up the your own instance of this insider

331
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:30,530
inside your environment so you can

332
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:34,580
import existing template and yet for now

333
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:38,200
as you can see we are exporting we are

334
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:42,980
creating the profiles per customers and

335
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:46,370
one general with with all of the data

336
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:52,340
from from the project so let's import

337
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:54,168
this one and here we go we have we have

338
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,240
highlighted all of the techniques for

339
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,340
which we already have some kind of

340
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,740
DeRose this is really good for the gap

341
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,790
analysis if you want to measure your

342
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:07,130
coverage from detection point of view or

343
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:11,020
when you have to present your

344
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,020
progression to the higher management

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,720
okay and the last demo I also mentioned

346
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,780
that we are exporting data to elastic

347
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,010
search index which can be then ingested

348
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,460
to

349
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:35,539
instance and this one also might be used

350
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:37,620
for this one also might be used for

351
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,770
reporting to higher management or

352
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,439
measuring your current progression so

353
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,350
this is the sample dashboard it was

354
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,840
built based on all available all

355
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,809
publicly available Sigma rules for the

356
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,510
Windows systems we've created this one

357
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:59,580
on 24th of this September so it's quite

358
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:02,400
up to date so some of the sample

359
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:06,360
analysis which which might be showed

360
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,700
here ok so first of all we see how much

361
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:15,418
rules we have per different tactics

362
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:18,000
another thing is just sample analysis is

363
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,860
the distribution of detection rules

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,990
implemented per customer so we can

365
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,270
easily track how many of rules which

366
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,240
we've developed are already implemented

367
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:30,720
in some environments and which are just

368
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,110
inside inside your organization and you

369
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,049
are not detecting anything with them

370
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:39,809
another thing is the distribution of

371
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:41,700
data in these providers so which data

372
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:44,158
sources provides your ability to

373
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,110
implement more rules and you can easily

374
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:48,090
see that almost half of the publicly

375
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:52,590
available C models currently are based

376
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:55,320
on the assessment data once almost 44

377
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,860
percent is based on the Microsoft

378
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,418
Windows security auditing box

379
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:05,570
another thing is distribution of

380
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:09,210
detection rules the distribution of the

381
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:11,490
detection was summary deeper than ended

382
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,090
providers so here you can also easily

383
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,740
see that this one is not only that's not

384
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,918
only allows you to implement more of the

385
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,200
rules but it will allows you to detect

386
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,840
more critical stuff so if you have this

387
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,880
conversation with higher management to

388
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,689
install system system on or not to

389
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,600
install sis

390
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:35,039
on this might be used as as a good point

391
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:39,059
in in such argument ok another

392
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:42,059
distribution is the detection rules

393
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,039
development status so it's easy to track

394
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:46,590
which rules are still in experimental

395
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,399
phase and you have to test them which

396
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:54,209
are ready for production and might be

397
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:59,039
implemented ok and in the in the bottom

398
00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:02,100
just a list of the detection routers top

399
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,408
10 of them and stopped and that I needed

400
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,418
so here you can easily see that system

401
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:08,580
on process creation is in the first

402
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:12,470
place the second one is the Windows

403
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:18,210
process creation with the command line

404
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:19,919
ok and let's go to the presentation so

405
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,950
some of the conclusions what we what we

406
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,659
achieved currently we have the mitre

407
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,730
attack detailed enough for the

408
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:31,679
operationalization so we can take the

409
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,559
technique and you can easily find which

410
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:38,899
data we need to detect it how to him how

411
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:42,629
to collect the this data what has to be

412
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:44,668
configured to be able to detect it and

413
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:46,889
so what are the mitigation systems which

414
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:50,279
we would like to which we might want to

415
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:52,379
use for for the mitigation we are using

416
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,049
analytics as a code so because we are

417
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:58,110
working only with plain text diamo files

418
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,120
we can use version tracking systems like

419
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:02,820
github or gitlab to track our

420
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,729
progression and see what was changed in

421
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,860
in the rules or in other entities we

422
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:10,440
have total automation so all of the

423
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,158
exports mapping uploads and updates now

424
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,320
are made with one simple command and as

425
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,639
i mentioned before that a lot of the

426
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,439
stuff we were doing manually and it was

427
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,678
taking a lot of time so now we have more

428
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,140
time to focus on more important things

429
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,390
we are able to visualize

430
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:34,270
existing analytics for analysis so as I

431
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,090
showed you with sample dashboard in

432
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:40,240
inside Cabana we can easily represent

433
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:43,449
what is what is our progression and show

434
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,660
it to our higher management we also have

435
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,360
automated coverage representation so

436
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,060
those my trip Navigator profiles

437
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,090
currently we are generating them only

438
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,399
for the from the detection point of view

439
00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:04,179
but soon we will also generate the

440
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:07,480
profiles for mitigation and mitigation

441
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,360
response and simulation point of view

442
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,890
and actually that's the first thing on

443
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,780
our list of ongoing works another the

444
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:20,170
second thing is the full Sigma support

445
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:23,680
so currently we have all of the data

446
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:26,140
which is needed for covering all of the

447
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,210
windows-based rows but we are also

448
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:34,120
working on the Linux part and network so

449
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,690
probably soon it will be we will be able

450
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,899
to say that we are fully covering the

451
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,730
current rule set from from the Sigma we

452
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,670
also initiated the open security

453
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,470
collaborative development sprint and if

454
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:51,970
you are interested in that one there is

455
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:54,070
a link pointing to the page with more

456
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:57,130
information so basically this will be

457
00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:01,360
activity on the hacker conference in

458
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:06,240
looks and work in ten days if I remember

459
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,520
correctly and it will focus on improving

460
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,590
the existing Sigma rules and creating

461
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,790
new new detection rules based on

462
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:20,939
existing and new result early and new

463
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:20,940
research we are also

464
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,519
discussing the collaboration with the

465
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,230
awesome project awesome project is the

466
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:31,649
project from Roberto Rodriguez which

467
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,019
deals with data dictionary so it's kinda

468
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:36,689
similar to what we have in our data

469
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:38,990
needed so to not duplicate the work we

470
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:43,799
are looking for some kind of D

471
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:45,899
collaboration on on this part we would

472
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,779
also like to speed projects into modules

473
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:51,809
because if you will go to our github

474
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,269
page right now the readme is like

475
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:57,120
extremely long it has detailed

476
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:59,070
information about everything and we

477
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,649
would like to split it and for now

478
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,350
mitigation systems are just the sub

479
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:08,039
modules so all information is in sub

480
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,899
modules so it will also allow some kind

481
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,960
of the integration if someone would like

482
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:15,330
to use only part of of the project we

483
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,679
also have the ongoing conversation with

484
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:22,320
miss regarding integration with with the

485
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:28,590
Miss galaxy project and we are working

486
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:32,668
on the web application with API so our

487
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:36,649
project could be queried by my different

488
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:42,620
projects or individuals for some of our

489
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:45,090
entities or our analytics so we are

490
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,129
warmly welcome any kind of the feedback

491
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:52,529
or suggestions so if you if you have any

492
00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:54,990
you can contact us if you would like to

493
00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:58,799
contribute we also have the list of the

494
00:25:54,990 --> 00:26:00,360
open issues and the github Timo page of

495
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,460
the confluence which I showed you is

496
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,740
available on the internet so you can

497
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,290
find it under the first link if you

498
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,500
would like to see how how it looks like

499
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,389
same goes for Dima of of the dull parts

500
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,820
