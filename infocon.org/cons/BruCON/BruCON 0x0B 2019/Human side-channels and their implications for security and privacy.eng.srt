1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,679
hi everyone so this is I'm unique just

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,099
like you human side channels and the

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,809
implications for security and privacy my

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:16,690
name is Matt wick see our lead security

5
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:19,419
research for PwC UK a cyber security

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,980
practice I'm also a part-time PhD

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,859
student at University College London but

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,839
not on this particular subject I've

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:27,609
worked at PwC for about three years now

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,159
prior to that I worked in the Met Police

11
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,929
in London doing research and development

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,520
and I've previously spoken at a number

13
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,000
of other security companies including

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,600
bukhan

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,030
a couple of years ago as well on that

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,620
subject just a quick disclaimer or more

17
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,629
of a warning than anything else I guess

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,849
so and does anyone remember my bukhan

19
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,218
talk from a couple of years ago I talked

20
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,989
about drones and lasers and bypassing

21
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,949
motion detectors it was all really cool

22
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:57,010
and last year someone came up to me and

23
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:58,570
said this guy called Carl Miller has put

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,358
a thing about you in his book in his

25
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,890
latest book so I bought an e-book copy

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,930
and saw this this was the footnote and

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,430
this is what he actually said and

28
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,080
there's a particular phrase in here that

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,220
will serve as this kind of warning or

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,960
disclaimer which is that so if I see you

31
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,470
falling asleep or walking out I won't

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,240
judge you or and take it personally so

33
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,158
that aims for this talk I'm going to

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,110
cover three human side channels and I'll

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,340
explain what they are shortly and how

36
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,490
they work on getting give you some

37
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,659
practical takeaways for each one

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,820
including some tools that you can play

39
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,829
with straightaway I'll look at the

40
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,898
implications of those side channels for

41
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,130
security and privacy some possible

42
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,600
countermeasures on the privacy

43
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,530
perspective and then some ideas for

44
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,908
future research as well so these are the

45
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,040
three human side channels we're going to

46
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,600
cover forensic linguistics behavioral

47
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,930
signatures and something called cultural

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,219
captures which is more of a new concept

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,140
before we get started I want to tell you

50
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:59,500
a story does anyone know who John

51
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,890
Christie is familiar with him well not

52
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:06,880
too many okay that's interesting so the

53
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,680
story behind this is in 1949 a man

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,389
called Timothy Evans walked into a

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,420
police

56
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,390
and he told the police that he had

57
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,320
accidentally killed his wife he gave

58
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,820
four statements to the police lots of

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,549
details of which contained contradictory

60
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:26,820
information but he was tried at court he

61
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,590
was found guilty and he was executed it

62
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,269
subsequently turned out that this man

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,700
John Christie who had shared a house

64
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,710
with Timothy Evans was actually guilty

65
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,170
for that murder and for the murder of

66
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:40,620
about seven other people at least seven

67
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,950
other people and we're kind of this talk

68
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,100
fits into that story is around forensic

69
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,410
linguistics so a researcher a

70
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,320
linguistics professor could Yan's far

71
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,790
Fick studied are the statements that

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,500
Timothy Evans had given to the police

73
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,359
and these statements were supposed to be

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,660
verbatim transcripts of what had been

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,940
said but what Slovak actually found was

76
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,489
that there were a number of distinct

77
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,709
authorial voices in those statements one

78
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,209
was Timothy Owens but the others were

79
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,560
believed to be of the police officers

80
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,880
who had interviewed him in other words

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,830
the police officers had manipulated

82
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,470
those statements to make Evans appear

83
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,450
guilty and as a result Timothy Evans was

84
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:24,260
posthumously pardoned after he'd been

85
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,810
executed for that murder so

86
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,940
the background of this talk if we're

87
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,519
looking for an offender or a criminal or

88
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,349
a suspect and it's a real-world crime

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,060
it's a burglary or a murder or something

90
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,619
like that there are number of things we

91
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,870
can look at evidentially we look at

92
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,190
things like fingerprints and DNA we

93
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,680
might even look at things like gait

94
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,170
analysis so how someone walks on camera

95
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,310
or something like that when it comes to

96
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,480
digital offenses there are sort of

97
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,250
analogies to that in the form of IP

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,899
addresses and MAC addresses and domain

99
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,459
names that kind of thing

100
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,280
what you might call kind of discrete

101
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,450
identifiers the problem with those of

102
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,079
course is that are really easy to

103
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,510
obfuscate and anonymized and spoof so as

104
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,760
a result investigators were often look

105
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,890
at other techniques to try and attribute

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,328
offenses to individuals or to throw

107
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,349
actors so a common one is that

108
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:18,739
investigators may try to correlate

109
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,570
attack activity to time zones of a

110
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,010
particular region so that they can save

111
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,550
throughout the group is most probably

112
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,530
located in this time zone other

113
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,570
investigators will look at TTP's and

114
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,570
look at the techniques and tactics and

115
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,800
tools that are used by offenders the

116
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,419
problem with these is they take us

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
further away from the individual they

118
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:39,200
might bring us to a threat actor group

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,849
or to a region of the world but not two

120
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,330
fingers on keyboards which is what this

121
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:47,180
talk is going to be about so when we

122
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,120
look at some computers machines they

123
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,260
have side channels they have

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,440
unintentional leakage usually in some

125
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,469
primitive output like sound or light as

126
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,810
a result of the things that they do and

127
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,820
that can in many cases be used for

128
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,590
things like tracking so radio signals

129
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,740
for example something called radio

130
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,880
fingerprinting can be used to track

131
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,400
chips with a very high degree of

132
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,780
accuracy and there is potentially a

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,570
real-world equivalent to this if you

134
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,669
consider humans as kind of bio computers

135
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,520
we have our own outputs we have speech

136
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,008
and text and that sort of thing

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,900
and we may also have unintentional

138
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,780
leakage as a result of generating those

139
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,710
outputs which in theory can be used to

140
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,030
trace or track certain activities to us

141
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,698
and this is rooted in something called

142
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:36,099
personality psychology theory which

143
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,680
essentially says that because we all

144
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:41,650
have a unique upbringing and training

145
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,080
and experiences and ways of looking at

146
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,120
the world that we have distinctive yet

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
consistent behavioral signatures with

148
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,060
everything we do in the way that we

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,069
react to things in the way that we write

150
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,590
in the way that we talk in the way that

151
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:57,310
we type on a computer and this is what I

152
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,299
mean by the term human side channels so

153
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,190
I'm going to start with forensic

154
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,169
linguistics so the reason I'm interested

155
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,060
in forensic linguistics my first degree

156
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:06,849
was in English literature and language

157
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,220
this is from a genuine email chain on my

158
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,930
first year at university I am on my

159
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,440
professor and told him I wanted to do an

160
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:18,610
essay on the etymology of the f-word and

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,759
this was his response that was his

162
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,770
response so anyway that kind of degree

163
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,949
got me interested in in linguistics and

164
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,599
looking at language so is anyone

165
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:31,630
familiar with forensic linguistics we've

166
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:34,180
got any linguists in the room at all no

167
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,349
anyone heard of the term before yeah

168
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,610
handful of people okay

169
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:38,919
all right cool if you haven't heard of

170
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,870
forensic linguistics it's a pretty niche

171
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:43,060
discipline so it started by that

172
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,360
professor I mentioned earlier on Yan's

173
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,370
farak and essentially it's the theory

174
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,960
that everyone has a unique style of

175
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,460
writing or a distinctive style of

176
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,560
writing

177
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,789
not so much in it's not handwriting or

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,180
anything like that I'll come to what it

179
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,009
isn't

180
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,229
shortly but it's the way that you

181
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,030
construct our writing in terms of

182
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:02,889
sentences and paragraphs and vocabulary

183
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,448
and things like that there are various

184
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,949
different branches of forensic

185
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,479
linguistics but the one we're going to

186
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:09,880
look at something called Salama tree

187
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,229
which is authorship attribution so given

188
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,460
a piece of text can I infer who wrote it

189
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:17,380
and it normally looks at these five

190
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,638
things spelling an orthography grammar

191
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,300
lexicon vocabulary idiom and identical

192
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,349
expressions

193
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,839
and in the real world forensic

194
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,039
linguistics is used in a number of

195
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:31,740
scenarios it's used in law enforcement

196
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,599
investigations prominently particularly

197
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,770
for things like ransom boats or for text

198
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,628
messages that have been sent after

199
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,240
murders or related to murders that sort

200
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,300
of thing it's used in academia to try

201
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,249
and investigate plagiarism allegations

202
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,449
it has been used in literature to try

203
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:47,189
and work out if Shakespeare actually

204
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,710
wrote Shakespeare's plays or if it was

205
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:52,589
someone else and similarly with the

206
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,008
Federalist Papers with JK Rowling's

207
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,689
first post Harry Potter novel which was

208
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,099
written under a pseudonym a forensic

209
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,319
linguistics was used to show that it was

210
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,360
her and uncovering miscarriages of

211
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,349
justice as with the Timothy Evans John

212
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,539
Christie case as well what forensic

213
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:11,128
linguistics isn't is working out if

214
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,378
someone's telling the truth or not and

215
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,089
that's a separate discipline and a

216
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,870
really interesting paper on this is the

217
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:22,789
one by van der Zee and others last year

218
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:28,080
they took the tweets of a well-known

219
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:29,938
world leader and they were able to using

220
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,309
a machine learning model and certain

221
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,949
kind of linguistic signposts when you

222
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,289
lie they were able to work out the

223
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,899
probability of each tweet being true or

224
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,309
not forensic linguistics

225
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,078
isn't trying to work out what someone

226
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:47,518
means by a piece of text it's not an

227
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:50,250
interpretation of it it's not as kind of

228
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,529
granular or precise as a fingerprint so

229
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,569
that's kind of a you know misconception

230
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,279
sometimes as I said it's not analyzing

231
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:58,439
handwriting or anything like that and

232
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,360
it's not looking normally at the context

233
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,699
or the content of text it's purely

234
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,150
around the structure and the kind of

235
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:07,880
technical elements of writing

236
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:11,510
so how do you do it there are various

237
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,040
ways complex methodologies involve the

238
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,069
creation of a corpus essentially a

239
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,569
database of texts from that database you

240
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,100
extract certain features that you're

241
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,589
interested in and they could be things

242
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,270
like word length sentence length number

243
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,070
of pronouns that kind of thing

244
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,189
and then you do some form of statistical

245
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,810
comparison nowadays one of the ones

246
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,730
that's most often uses support vector

247
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,770
machines and machine learning but there

248
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,910
are kind of traditional statistics that

249
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,850
are used as well as a principal

250
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,920
component analysis that kind of thing a

251
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,330
more basic usage of it and I'm going to

252
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,020
go into a bit more detail on this later

253
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,120
is just looking for unusual Spelling's

254
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,439
and punctuation and sentence structure

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,180
and that's something that doesn't

256
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,070
necessarily require any kind of machine

257
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,599
learning or anything like that and then

258
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,210
just searching for those same things

259
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,330
either on just Google or all within a

260
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,600
corpus that you've built so here are a

261
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,400
couple of examples of where that basic

262
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,990
technique has been used in the real

263
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,480
world the woman on the left is called

264
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,709
Julie Turner she was murdered in the UK

265
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,770
in 2005 and after she went missing our

266
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,540
text was sent from her phone to someone

267
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,329
else's phone saying that she was leaving

268
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,000
and going away to sort her head out one

269
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:25,310
of the suspects in that murder case when

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,890
interviewed by police used exactly the

271
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,410
same term when he was speaking to the

272
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,610
officers and it was later found out that

273
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,319
he was the one who had committed the

274
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,620
murder and who had sent those texts from

275
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,900
Judy Turner's phone pretending to be her

276
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:42,200
on the right are two Scottish men who

277
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:46,010
were sent to prison in the 80s during a

278
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,540
gang war in Scotland for for murder the

279
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,939
interesting thing here is this is about

280
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,459
um kind of recollection of memory as

281
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,470
much as linguistics so these two men

282
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:57,800
were alleged by the police to have said

283
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,110
a particular phrase some hours after

284
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,790
they were alleged to have said it and a

285
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,890
number of police officers were able to

286
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,400
apparently

287
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,110
the exact phrase that had been said and

288
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,490
research shows that really that's kind

289
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,840
of not possible people would have kind

290
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,740
of different memories that kind of thing

291
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,270
but again a basic technique because an

292
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,920
investigator into this googled that

293
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,800
phrase wasn't able to kind of find any

294
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,240
other appearances of it so the suspicion

295
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,229
was that the police officers had made

296
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,180
that up in terms of cybercrime assad

297
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,830
security specifically there's been a lot

298
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,180
of academic research on how to apply

299
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,460
forensic linguistics to various

300
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,989
scenarios looking at tweets looking at

301
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,300
things like detecting sock puppet

302
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,580
accounts so if one person for instance

303
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,260
is running multiple social media

304
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,790
accounts pretending to be different

305
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,380
people you could use forensic

306
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,939
linguistics to try and tie those back to

307
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,620
one individual

308
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,290
similarly with forum posts that have

309
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,100
been written under kind of anonymous

310
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,839
names or pseudonyms same with emails

311
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,220
there's also a really interesting

312
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,130
sub-discipline of this which is looking

313
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,140
at source code so using style on a tree

314
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,610
to try an attribute source code to an

315
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,870
individual because everyone has their

316
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,150
own kind of unique style of writing

317
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,460
source code and that has been expanded

318
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,449
recently by Calais can Islam and others

319
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,950
where they've been able to the anonymous

320
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,680
programmers based on compiled binaries

321
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,360
and so after compilation because some of

322
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,439
those artifacts still survive which is a

323
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,670
really interesting some case studies in

324
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,590
the real world applied to cyber

325
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:29,650
operation tripoli which was a checkpoint

326
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:33,520
investigation just a few months ago this

327
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,740
was a mass-scale facebook social

328
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,270
engineering campaign where fake profiles

329
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,790
were set up as kind of watering holes

330
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,199
and people visiting those profiles those

331
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,380
pages and clicking on links were

332
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,910
subjected to drug by malware attacks

333
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,200
what checkpoint were able to do which is

334
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,990
really cool is they were looking for

335
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,300
repeated spelling errors and grammatical

336
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,820
errors made by the authors of those fake

337
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,250
profiles and by doing so they're able to

338
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,430
reveal over thirty other profiles which

339
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,960
were by the same threat actor Judith

340
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,839
Braun in 2016

341
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,690
looked at the language used by IRS phone

342
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,050
scam errs so people who try and do

343
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,300
social engineering over the phone

344
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,800
so con people have money and was able to

345
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,500
find a number of techniques that those

346
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,920
individuals used which could help people

347
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,630
identify them as scammers before before

348
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,060
the crime actually occurs and then

349
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,890
lastly there's bücher 42.0 this is a

350
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,569
fascinating example so in this case you

351
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:30,740
had a suspect who was from one country

352
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,899
pretending to be a native speaker of

353
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,220
another country which was really

354
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,320
interesting so that's definitely worth a

355
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,380
look at the work by algum on a couple of

356
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,850
years ago some other use cases that you

357
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,860
could apply forensic linguistics to

358
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,990
would be spearfishing so where you've

359
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,670
got three actors sending emails perhaps

360
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,100
under different pretext but pretend um

361
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,719
but they are by the same author

362
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,130
things like manifestos that are posted

363
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,100
online after or before attacks

364
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,810
ransomware instructions and potentially

365
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,100
insider threats so kind of language

366
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:04,399
profiling tweets that coordinating like

367
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,050
DDoS attacks and then you could if you

368
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,130
wanted to if you're interested I suppose

369
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,160
you could try and use it to identify

370
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,149
people like Satoshi Nakamoto I'd be

371
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,680
surprised if that hasn't been done

372
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:16,459
already if someone hasn't tried that but

373
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,109
somebody potentially you could do it so

374
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,209
an example of how you could use this

375
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,860
would be saying a spear phishing email

376
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,209
comes into your organization or you're

377
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,279
working for an incident response team

378
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,439
looking at spear phishing emails come in

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,760
you might notice an unusual turn of

380
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,950
phrase or several kind of unusual

381
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,390
sentences you could Google that that

382
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,519
might then give you further leads to go

383
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,930
and investigate

384
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:38,399
similarly if you've got um if you'll

385
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,138
become aware of certain attacks like

386
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,930
DDoS attacks being coordinated on

387
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,339
Twitter you could take certain phrases

388
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,019
or words from those tweets and then

389
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,240
compare them either to a corpus that you

390
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:53,370
have or again search on Google to try

391
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,660
and get some some new leads now the the

392
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,779
problem that a lot of people kind of

393
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,339
suggest when I say this is but isn't

394
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,899
forensic linguistics are really kind of

395
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,699
specialist discipline that you need at

396
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,199
least a master's degree in linguistics

397
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,599
to be able to do it that internet

398
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,769
machine learning and have kind of

399
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,120
expensive stats software and things like

400
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:10,500
that and you don't really it's really

401
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,389
simple so I'm going to show you some

402
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,970
tools that you can use that are all

403
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:17,279
open-source they're all free to download

404
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,949
that you can kind of play around with so

405
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,069
this is the first one this is Jacob this

406
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:25,258
is fairly well maintained a fairly steep

407
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,519
learning curve because it uses a lot of

408
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,310
different techniques and you have to

409
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:33,089
play around with a lot of the settings

410
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,489
but it's a good introduction to it it

411
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,560
works pretty well there's a dealt of

412
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,620
spreadsheets um so this only uses kind

413
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,599
of one statistical measure and as

414
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,160
security professional issue you'll be

415
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,480
delighted to know that for this one you

416
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,170
have to download a spreadsheet and

417
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,790
enable macros but as you can see that

418
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,800
the kind of output of this doesn't look

419
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,209
that user-friendly at first once you get

420
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,380
used to it it's not that bad it's a

421
00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:01,319
fairly simple fairly simple process the

422
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,910
Salama tree which is a couple of Python

423
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,610
scripts this one gives you a nice

424
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,199
graphical output so the output of this

425
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,760
one is on the right hand side it's a

426
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,310
graph this is using a technique called

427
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,260
principal components analysis and what

428
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,109
it does is it groups texts according to

429
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,500
how similar they are so you can see here

430
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,880
there are various examples of well-known

431
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,350
novels and plays in English literature

432
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,810
and they've been grouped together

433
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,149
according to how similar this algorithm

434
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,709
determines that they are and you can see

435
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,050
how that could be applied to a corpus of

436
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,810
spear phishing emails or tweets or

437
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:36,120
something like that

438
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,880
stylo is a library for the stats package

439
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,920
are open source so this is a nice one

440
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,780
again a number of different techniques

441
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,599
you can use it's got a nice GUI I think

442
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,260
you need to know about kind of five

443
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,540
instructions to be able to run

444
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,390
everything in it which is quite nice

445
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,990
and then Shiloh which is my favorite is

446
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:58,230
a graphical wrapper for stylo so this

447
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,700
can be run in a browser and as you can

448
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,440
see again you've got the output on the

449
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,630
right-hand side here of which group text

450
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,530
according to how similar they are again

451
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,060
you can kind of play with the

452
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:11,099
configuration and stuff with this as

453
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:14,520
well so this is an example of me using

454
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:17,550
Shiloh for some blog articles within PwC

455
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,500
so you can see mine at the top there

456
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,270
wixi and then you've got some by my

457
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,310
colleague James Hampshire and Rob

458
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,510
MacGregor and you can see that the

459
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,619
algorithm has done a pretty good job of

460
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,200
kind of grouping those together

461
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,669
according to how similar they are there

462
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,590
are some caveats to that which I'll come

463
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,680
back to but if you're interested this is

464
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,540
a table of all the tools how hard I

465
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,240
think they are to use what methods they

466
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,310
use and how scalable they might be and

467
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:45,420
depending on kind of how how much you

468
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,460
wanted to use this so caveat so

469
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,650
something called register makes a very

470
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,720
big difference with forensic linguistics

471
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,370
register is the style in which you're

472
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,700
writing the audience which are writing

473
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,290
for you do need a baseline of text and

474
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,180
so you do need kind of some sizable

475
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,850
samples of text you can't just compare

476
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,590
kind of one tweet to one other tweet you

477
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:07,530
may need some ground truth depending on

478
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,149
what you're trying to prove if there's a

479
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,010
significant time lapse between two

480
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,150
pieces of writing that can affect the

481
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,440
results so if someone's written

482
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,670
something and in ten years they've

483
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,860
written ten years later they've written

484
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,870
something else it may appear very

485
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,500
different and it's not a silver bullet

486
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:24,419
it's not guaranteed to be 100% accurate

487
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,070
so here are a couple of examples of how

488
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,430
register can make a big difference just

489
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:31,260
to illustrate so the graph on the Left

490
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:35,640
contains various chapters from the novel

491
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:38,370
1984 by George Orwell has anyone read

492
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,430
1984 yeah are quite a few but I'll get

493
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,909
with them so in 1984 there's a chapter

494
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,620
you remember which is kind of a book

495
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,990
within a book is the book that was

496
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,199
written by goldstein the Winston Smith

497
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:54,240
is reading and that is that outlier here

498
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,850
down towards the bottom the bottom left

499
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,620
is that book within a book because all

500
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:00,030
well wrote that particular chapter in a

501
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,649
different style pretending to be a

502
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:06,740
different author so it shows you how

503
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:09,630
well that can kind of distort register

504
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,070
on the right you've got my blog articles

505
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,690
and then you've got like very short

506
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,250
stories and things I've written so even

507
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,360
though it's the same person writing all

508
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,950
these things because I've written them

509
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,290
in different genre different style

510
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,390
whilst my blog articles are all in kind

511
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,280
of corporate speak so you can group them

512
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,250
quite closely together everything else

513
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,168
is all over the place

514
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,580
now there are some previously applica

515
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,600
implications with forensic linguistics

516
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,370
obviously there are really legitimate

517
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,230
and powerful reasons why people would

518
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,149
want to write anonymously or under a

519
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,590
different identity and potentially

520
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,350
forensic linguistics could be used to

521
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,168
diminish that anonymity there are some

522
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,500
countermeasures available even just

523
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,299
being aware that you have a distinct

524
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,929
linguistic style can help you to kind of

525
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,799
overcome being tracked by and help you

526
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:56,809
to disguise it

527
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,918
you could try imitating someone else's

528
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:01,370
style that's something that's been

529
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,960
looked at before something that gets

530
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,449
suggested quite a lot is using Google

531
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,039
Translate so running a particular phrase

532
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,929
through Google Translate and then

533
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,730
translating it like twelve times into

534
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,470
twelve different languages and then

535
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,380
converting the end result back into

536
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,179
whatever language it is you want to use

537
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,559
you then kind of have to it really

538
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,600
messes up the meaning so you kind of

539
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,549
have to you know massage it a little bit

540
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,189
but some but that can work you can

541
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,780
combine with other authors that can help

542
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,970
it can be quite difficult to kind of

543
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,730
differentiate between different authors

544
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:36,770
there are specific tools as well that

545
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:39,080
have been developed to try and defeat

546
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,570
forensic linguistics one of which is

547
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,309
anonymous which was published in 2012

548
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,710
you can still get hold of that on github

549
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,270
it's not being maintained and you kind

550
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,120
of have to mess around with the code to

551
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,650
get it to work but it's an area I think

552
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,770
that is kind of crying out for some more

553
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,289
work in terms of countermeasures and

554
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:59,150
enabling privacy so what can you do now

555
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,740
with forensic linguistics if you want to

556
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:03,710
take this back to wherever it is you

557
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,380
work and your day job you could just

558
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,870
build up your corpus a kind of database

559
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,309
of text whether that's from previous

560
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,168
attacks whether it's open source stuff

561
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:13,250
just have a play with those tools and

562
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,470
see if they work and see if it's

563
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:19,159
something that you you might want to to

564
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,690
use if you could use it okay we'll move

565
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,330
on to the next human side channel which

566
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:27,169
is behavioral signatures

567
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,239
I always pause there for a laugh but it

568
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:32,239
never gets won because it's a very very

569
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:35,840
niche audience of machine learning

570
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:39,499
engineers and jay-z fans which I don't

571
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,449
think maybe doesn't exist so this is

572
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,980
about attribution specifically based on

573
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,669
behavior

574
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,929
so aside from things like discrete

575
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,999
identifiers that we mentioned previously

576
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:52,730
IP addresses MAC addresses that sort of

577
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:55,309
thing an active area of research in kind

578
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,470
of attribution is who acts and why do

579
00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:00,168
they hack so it's a kind of sociographic

580
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,519
ethnographic look at it and have been

581
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,889
various authors who have looked at

582
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,019
things like motivation and skill and

583
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:07,908
attack behaviors there's the hack of

584
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:09,919
profiling project you might be aware of

585
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,899
there's looking at the psychological

586
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,289
elements of being involved in the hacker

587
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:18,080
culture and specifically what attackers

588
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:20,029
do on a compromised machine what hasn't

589
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,629
been looked at is trying to compare

590
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,309
those profiles and those things and that

591
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,529
led me on to something called case

592
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,299
linkage analysis has anyone familiar

593
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:31,549
with case linkage analysis was sort of

594
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,749
it before it's a pretty neat discipline

595
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:37,639
and it's primarily been used in academia

596
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:40,489
it's essentially a way to statistically

597
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:42,678
try and link crimes together based on

598
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:46,600
very granular common features is not

599
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:49,159
offender profiling offender profiling is

600
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,668
trying to infer something about an

601
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,200
offender based on a crime case linkage

602
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:56,239
analysis is looking at particular

603
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,859
features of a crime and comparing it to

604
00:22:56,239 --> 00:23:00,859
another crime to see how similar they

605
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:04,470
might be and in doing so potentially you

606
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:06,449
can link it to a common offender

607
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,040
so there have been there has been some

608
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,600
success in academic literature with

609
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,120
applying case linkage analysis to

610
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,030
real-world crimes in homicide burglary

611
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,030
robbery sexual offences arson that kind

612
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,240
of thing but not cyber attacks until the

613
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,770
research I'm going to present to you now

614
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,120
the case linked analysis is based on

615
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,350
those same principles I mentioned

616
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,129
earlier of distinctiveness and

617
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:31,590
consistency this idea that offenders

618
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,470
like anyone else have distinctive yet

619
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,939
consistent ways of offending so if you

620
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,010
take one crime that they've committed

621
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,980
it's highly likely that they will behave

622
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:45,750
in a similar way in their next offense

623
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,850
and the benefits of linking are that you

624
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,560
can investigate crimes together so you

625
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:53,429
can save on resources you can build up a

626
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,960
body of evidence you can use it as a

627
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,540
decision-making aid various kind of

628
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,520
other benefits as well so let's look at

629
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,409
a couple of example is this a really

630
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,910
simple example but let's say you're a

631
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,370
police officer and you're investigating

632
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,550
this crime which in the UK would be

633
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:11,879
criminal damage and then you've got a

634
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:14,490
second crime not too far away and you

635
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,800
think that these crimes might be linked

636
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,050
but how do you prove it how do you kind

637
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,820
of get a statistical evidence base for

638
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,000
saying that these two crimes were

639
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,830
probably committed by the same person so

640
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,210
case linkage analysis requires that

641
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,189
first of all you create something called

642
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,470
behavioral domains which is essentially

643
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,580
kind of categories of behavior so in

644
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,040
this case you might be looking at

645
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,290
equipment used or property targeted that

646
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,790
kind of thing then within each of those

647
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,260
categories each of those domains you're

648
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,879
going to have very granular behaviors

649
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,840
which are essentially yes/no questions

650
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:49,320
so with these examples did the attacker

651
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,970
use a stencil did they use color or was

652
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,620
it in black and white did they sign the

653
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,120
image did they use this kind of paint or

654
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,860
that kind of paint and so on and so on

655
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,260
and you repeat that for every D

656
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,520
Haverhill domain that you've got you

657
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,400
then calculate something called a

658
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,680
similarity coefficient now this is a

659
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,120
pretty crude measure of the similarity

660
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,710
between two things has anyone done

661
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,539
anything with similarity coefficients

662
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,799
before

663
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:13,480
okay this is probably one of the

664
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,250
simplest ones this is the one that's

665
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,740
normally used in case linkage analysis

666
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,740
so for each behavioral domain that

667
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,230
you've got you have an x value which is

668
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,090
behaviors present in both attacks a Y

669
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,640
value which is behaviors present in

670
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,470
crime a but not crime be a Zed value

671
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,270
which is the opposite of that and that

672
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,190
will give you a value between one which

673
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,559
is perfect similarity so the crimes are

674
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:38,530
identical and zero which means that

675
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,000
perfectly dissimilar you could stop

676
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,649
there if you wanted to if you're not

677
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,150
kind of interested in getting into the

678
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,940
kind of statistical depth you could use

679
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,350
this a very crude measure if you wanted

680
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,640
to take it further there's logistic

681
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,389
regression

682
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,490
so logistic regression is a statistical

683
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:56,409
technique that will let us try and

684
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,870
predict whether or not crimes were

685
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,220
committed by the same offender using

686
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,649
that similarity coefficient as a

687
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,240
starting point it will also tell us

688
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,159
which of those behavioral domains

689
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,850
contributes more to predictive accuracy

690
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,530
and if we combine them what's the best

691
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:15,309
way of combining them to try and work

692
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,440
out the answer now if you haven't played

693
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,820
with logistic regression before but you

694
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,860
want to kind of play around with it and

695
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,260
see if you can replicate or test out

696
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,699
these results there's loads of tutorials

697
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,220
online is not difficult I've never done

698
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,630
any logistic regression before I did

699
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,230
these experiments so there's hope for

700
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,480
everyone

701
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,350
and you can use something called SPSS

702
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,850
which is a tool that you can I think

703
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,799
that's a paid tool but there's also R

704
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,199
which is a free one that you can use as

705
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,820
well so you would run logistic

706
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,799
regression for each behavioral domain

707
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,080
and that will give you a positive or

708
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,480
negative correlation something called a

709
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,330
p-value which just gives you an

710
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,039
indication of statistical significance

711
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:56,110
and you could also use something called

712
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,960
forward stepwise logistic regression

713
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,459
which essentially is machine learning so

714
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,110
you would start with one behavioral

715
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:04,240
domain and you'd add one at each step

716
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,770
and work out the extent to which that

717
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,710
contributes towards the predictive

718
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,820
accuracy of the entire model

719
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,420
you then use something called rock

720
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,159
curves

721
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,210
has anyone heard of ROC curves before

722
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:20,060
then play around with ROC curves

723
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,710
okay so ROC curves the rock stands for

724
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,020
receiver operating characteristic and

725
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:26,030
it's just a graphical way to represent

726
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,520
the predictive accuracy of machine

727
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,280
learning essentially so it's a graph it

728
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,960
plots X which is the probability of a

729
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,139
false positive against Y which is the

730
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,490
probability of a true positive and the

731
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,110
value that we're interested in is

732
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,210
something called an AUC value which

733
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:44,330
automatically gets calculated when you

734
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,850
create a ROC curve this is what a ROC

735
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:49,340
curve looks like so the area that we're

736
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:52,520
interested in is the AUC value our area

737
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:54,860
under the curve and if that AUC value is

738
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,930
0.5 to 0.7 that means it's low

739
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,600
predictive accuracy point seven 2.9

740
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:02,590
means good and point 9 into 1 is high

741
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,590
perfect

742
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:10,129
so why would you want to apply case

743
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,870
linkage analysis to cyberattacks and why

744
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:15,620
hadn't it been done before why did I

745
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:17,600
decide to do it well in principle a

746
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,969
cyber offense is the same as any other

747
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,969
offense you have an offender attacking a

748
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:25,039
target there's a victim the offender has

749
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,730
to have a certain offending strategy in

750
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,350
order to obtain a result that they want

751
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,639
and the idea for this actually came when

752
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:38,149
I was doing our CP a few years ago now

753
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:41,649
have you got any o SC pees in a room how

754
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:44,449
are quite a few awsome so you remember

755
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:47,209
when you do a CP that you get access to

756
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,740
like an IRC channel and you get to talk

757
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,269
to other students who are also doing

758
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,429
this and you're talking about machines

759
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:54,620
in the lab that you're attacking and

760
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,179
you're kind of swapping strategies and

761
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,668
tools and ideas and that kind of thing

762
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:02,440
and what I noticed in this IRC channel

763
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:04,580
was that um firstly that people have a

764
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,210
seem to have a different way of doing

765
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,830
things

766
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,480
everyone's got their own kind of pet

767
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,279
strategy for attacking a certain

768
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,629
vulnerability or something like that and

769
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:13,070
the second thing was once someone had

770
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:15,019
kind of settled on a particular way of

771
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,399
doing things they tended to stick to

772
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:19,909
that way of doing things so again its

773
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,590
distinctiveness and consistency so a

774
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:24,110
scenario where you might want to use

775
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,850
this is let's say you've got a network

776
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,129
breach any type of network breach really

777
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,899
and then a couple of years later there's

778
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:31,549
another one and it seems like the

779
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:33,439
methodology is really similar it might

780
00:29:31,549 --> 00:29:35,029
be the same kind of malware it might be

781
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,070
a similar vulnerability that was

782
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:39,200
exploited or their exfiltrating similar

783
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,000
types of data and going back to the

784
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,710
graffiti example what we'd want to do is

785
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,269
work out what's the statistical

786
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:48,830
probability that this is done by the

787
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:51,110
same offender so on to the interesting

788
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,270
part which is the experiment the I ran

789
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,740
to Troy and

790
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,540
empirically show the case linkage

791
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,110
analysis can be used for investigating

792
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:03,770
site preferences so I took a an open

793
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,240
source SSH key logger from github

794
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,190
modified it a little bit and I set up

795
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,280
two virtual machines and exposed them on

796
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,700
the internet over SSH so they were kind

797
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:18,870
of like honey pots and then I recruited

798
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,720
ten pen testers and students and amateur

799
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,300
enthusiasts and I asked them to SSH into

800
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,530
these virtual machines whereupon they

801
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,960
were given access they had low

802
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,750
privileges and I asked them to try and

803
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,040
get root to try and still day to cover

804
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,740
their tracks and just generally kind of

805
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:38,670
poke around the file system as if it was

806
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:41,820
like a CTF or something like that so

807
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,590
each person attacked each machine so

808
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,290
there were two virtual machines and what

809
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:48,389
I went to see was how possible would it

810
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:54,030
be to try and link together the paired

811
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:55,530
attacks so my key logger was recording

812
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,230
everything that these volunteers were

813
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,420
doing on these systems so I defined

814
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,040
behavioral domains in this case there

815
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,890
were three there was navigation which

816
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,290
was how the volunteers kind of navigated

817
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,900
around the file system enumeration so

818
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,100
commands they were using to try and find

819
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,200
out more about the machines that they

820
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,300
were attacking and then exploitation

821
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,580
which covered things like privilege

822
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,790
escalation attempts exfiltration

823
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:24,360
attempts downloading malware that kind

824
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:26,040
of thing and turn these into yes-or-no

825
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,199
questions so to give you a couple of

826
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,510
examples one would be did an attacker

827
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,220
try to use W get to download malware

828
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,389
from a remote site

829
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,460
[Music]

830
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:39,990
a more granular example did the attacker

831
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,340
use LS - lah as opposed to LS - al so in

832
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:43,499
some cases getting quite granular

833
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,879
looking at specific commands which is

834
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:50,450
that the attackers were using then

835
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:53,279
calculated the similarity coefficient

836
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,350
this gives you a better example of the

837
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,639
kind of granularity that I was looking

838
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:01,259
at this is for the exploitation

839
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:02,789
behavioral domain so you can see it's

840
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,480
not just a case of did the attacker use

841
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:08,158
sudo it's where they're using pseudo in

842
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,350
a particular context with a particular

843
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,580
switch where they're trying to pseudo as

844
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:16,830
a particular user that sort of thing and

845
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,139
these are the Jack odd values the

846
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,399
similarity coefficient values now I said

847
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:21,928
earlier that you could if you're not

848
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,369
interested in logistic regression or you

849
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,590
don't want to use it you could just stop

850
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:27,689
here and this is a good example of that

851
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,480
so if you look at the column the mean

852
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,509
average column second from the left

853
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,570
you'll see that the mean value for

854
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:39,570
linked offenses is much much higher than

855
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,899
the unlinked value so you've got 0.75

856
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,450
sorry 0.76 to 1.6 for example for

857
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:49,049
navigation for enumeration point six

858
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,519
four two point one one so you could just

859
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:52,139
stop there depending on how much data

860
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,840
you've got and how kind of in-depth you

861
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:56,039
want to go into if you want to carry on

862
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,990
doing logistic regression and roc curves

863
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,730
that kind of thing these are the

864
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,919
eventual ROC curve results and the

865
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,220
column to focus on here is the AUC

866
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:10,799
column remember from when I showed you

867
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:13,019
the graph of ROC curves that an AUC

868
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,330
value of 1 means it's kind of perfect

869
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,279
predictive accuracy so you can see with

870
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:21,360
navigation enumeration and exploitation

871
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,560
it ranges from 0.9 1 up to 0.99

872
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,570
which is very high

873
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,610
so some ways that this could be applied

874
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,409
in the real world is you could run

875
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,760
interactive honey pots and have some

876
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,400
kind of key logger running on them to

877
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,300
build up profiles of attackers

878
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,790
potentially you could also identify

879
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,810
attackers who've trained together who

880
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,850
have done the same kind of

881
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,950
qualifications or we've had the same

882
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:45,320
mentor or things like that because

883
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,910
they'll do things in a similar way there

884
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,399
are some caveats to using this technique

885
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,260
as with forensic linguistics some

886
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,960
offenders will be more distinctive than

887
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:57,550
others some behaviors will be less

888
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,990
consistent crucially and particularly

889
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:02,690
pertinent with regards to cybersecurity

890
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,390
is that an offender's mo is a learned

891
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,100
behavior and attackers offenders do

892
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,650
develop over time they learn new tricks

893
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,949
and techniques so they're common

894
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,900
strategies might change and crucially as

895
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:16,699
well it's been found in case linkage

896
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,320
analysis literature that offenders will

897
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,449
change their behaviors in response to

898
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,520
events what that means in practice is

899
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:24,859
that for crimes that involve a lot of

900
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,668
offender victim interaction so things

901
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,830
like robbery

902
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:31,790
for example offenders are generally less

903
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,310
distinctive and consistent because

904
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,139
they're sometimes acting in response to

905
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,759
what the victim does so if the victim

906
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,819
fights back or runs away or something

907
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,169
like that as opposed to something like

908
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:46,810
burglary where typically the victim is

909
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:49,668
not there so in terms of cyber offenses

910
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,270
the kind of attacker strategy may change

911
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,460
depending on

912
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,500
what security mechanisms are on the host

913
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,570
they're attacking whether the blue team

914
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,320
is aware of their presence that kind of

915
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:03,300
thing some caveats for this experiment

916
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,810
specifically this is a very small sample

917
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,150
of people is 10 volunteers so it really

918
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,869
needs to be kind of widened out with

919
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,090
more data

920
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:14,100
ideally real-world data as well to see

921
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,840
if this is a viable in the real world

922
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,730
it's only looking at one operating

923
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,450
system in one scenario in this case

924
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:25,380
Linux machines with low privileged ssh

925
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:26,700
accounts as their SSH access so it

926
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,990
remains to be seen whether the same

927
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,970
thing would apply to something like a

928
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,709
DDoS attack for example whether you

929
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:35,779
could get that level of granularity that

930
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:37,830
you need these weren't real attackers

931
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:40,710
firstly that they were kind of pen

932
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,540
testers or students but also that they

933
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:44,160
knew they didn't have to be that careful

934
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:47,100
about hiding their tracks for example

935
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,819
because they knew is an experiment for a

936
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,650
piece of academic research not all

937
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,990
attackers will have the same motivations

938
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:58,560
so for instance not all attackers will

939
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:00,029
want or need to escalate to root to

940
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,549
achieve whatever it is they're trying to

941
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,609
achieve and again not 100% accurate as

942
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:08,460
with forensic linguistics so there are

943
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:09,779
some privacy implications to this in the

944
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,400
sense that people can be linked to

945
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,770
separate hosts or separate identities

946
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,869
based on the way that they type and

947
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,609
potentially that's regardless of how

948
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,890
good their OPSEC all their anonymizing

949
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,540
measures are elsewhere so people could

950
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,240
be linked to historical or future

951
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,960
activity on a particular machine using

952
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,279
this technique countermeasures would be

953
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,710
kind of similar to forensic linguistics

954
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,450
in a way you could make a conscious

955
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,980
decision to try it if you know that you

956
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,779
always use particular switches for a

957
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,369
particular command or that you have a

958
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,880
particular strategy for doing something

959
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,490
you could switch the hop it'll be harder

960
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,020
to automate than a forensic linguistics

961
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,970
you could maybe semi automated using

962
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,800
scripts or something like that you could

963
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,350
randomize ordering of commands which is

964
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,110
you could switch up the tools you use so

965
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:58,080
you could use W get instead of curl

966
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,910
you could use buy instead of nano other

967
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,900
I realize how controversial that

968
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:06,029
statement might be so in terms of what

969
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,280
you can do now with this information you

970
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,990
can give this a go it sounds complicated

971
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,630
if you haven't done statistics before

972
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,779
it's really not not that bad so you

973
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,010
could run like a CTF or something

974
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,210
make sure the participants are aware of

975
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,220
what it is you're doing but you could

976
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,930
log over there keystrokes and maybe just

977
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,089
try and calculate the jackpot scores and

978
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,700
see if this actually works and if it

979
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,020
does work you could try and scale up so

980
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,899
one of the things that we're looking at

981
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,290
is whether this could be automated with

982
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,060
something like R or Python other

983
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,440
behavioral domains will also be of

984
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,080
interest as well so we didn't really

985
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,510
look too much at evasion techniques or

986
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,279
kind of anti forensic steps but that's

987
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,070
something that that could be done as

988
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,020
well if you want more detail there is a

989
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,390
white paper available on this and

990
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,730
there's also a longer talk on this

991
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:57,750
subject which I gave at Def Con last

992
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:01,050
year that's on YouTube ok I'll move on

993
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:03,480
to the last one before I start does

994
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,620
anyone get this reference otherwise we

995
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,680
might be in for it's horrid

996
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:09,569
20 minutes nope okay this would be

997
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,169
interesting okay so this is cultural

998
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:15,690
captures and this is a little bit more

999
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,640
abstract and more of an idea than the

1000
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,440
previous two so the previous two human

1001
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,420
side channels are talked about are very

1002
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,860
much kind of rooted in statistics as

1003
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,320
empirical evidence to show that they

1004
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,720
work they just haven't been applied that

1005
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,360
much to cyber offenses this is something

1006
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,399
a bit more experimental that needs a bit

1007
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,340
more research but essentially it's

1008
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,349
looking at a particular problem in

1009
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,829
social media on social media

1010
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:42,180
so if you have a given account on social

1011
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:44,789
media and you want to know is this

1012
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,140
account a human or a bot there are

1013
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,119
various things you can look for there's

1014
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:50,160
been a lot of research on various kind

1015
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,769
of behaviors and features that can be

1016
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,449
used to try and work out if it's an

1017
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,689
automated account or if it's a human at

1018
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:59,579
the keyboard and there are various paid

1019
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,049
and free services where you can submit

1020
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:02,009
the name of a Twitter account for

1021
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,900
example and it will give you a

1022
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:06,329
probability of how likely is that that

1023
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,499
account is a bot or not a much harder

1024
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:12,390
question is is the person running this

1025
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:14,968
account assuming I'm very short as a

1026
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:17,160
person if they're claiming to be British

1027
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:19,049
for example are they actually British

1028
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,969
and the context in which that's

1029
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,339
important would be things where you have

1030
00:39:20,969 --> 00:39:25,499
hostile social media accounts attempting

1031
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:29,009
to influence conversations or consensus

1032
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:31,589
around a particular political issue so

1033
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:34,680
an election a referendum something like

1034
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:38,219
that mentioning no specific words

1035
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,598
beginning with B so we think these

1036
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,940
people probably human but how do we

1037
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,380
prove that should equal authentic and

1038
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,019
this potentially the way cultural

1039
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,239
captures can come in so cultural

1040
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:50,698
captures is a term life come up with to

1041
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:53,160
describe a cultural artifact which

1042
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:57,209
hasn't really spread beyond its placed

1043
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,459
its regional country of origin in most

1044
00:39:57,209 --> 00:40:01,379
cases and the examples I'm going to show

1045
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:03,569
you that's popular culture but it can

1046
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,559
also be things like language cultural

1047
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:11,459
norms food music that sort of thing so

1048
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:15,209
which one example I I gave this talk at

1049
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:17,249
blackhat in August and this is a British

1050
00:40:15,209 --> 00:40:18,629
example and there was one British person

1051
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,899
in the audience so this didn't work at

1052
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,420
all

1053
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:23,250
but if you know who these two people are

1054
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,250
put your hand up

1055
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,900
okay and now if you're from the you keep

1056
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,020
you keep you handle and if you're from

1057
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,640
the UK or you grew up in the UK or you

1058
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,020
spent a significant amount of time in

1059
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,020
the UK put your hand down

1060
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,348
I won I won okay one outlier okay

1061
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:43,569
interesting all right

1062
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:45,750
if you're curious these two are

1063
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:48,400
children's entertainers they ran a

1064
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:50,410
children's TV show in the corner 90s and

1065
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,930
2000's but they never really kind of

1066
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,308
spread beyond the UK so this wasn't I

1067
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,578
don't think it was broadcast outside of

1068
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:59,890
the UK let's try another one so if you

1069
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:03,460
know the answer to this question put

1070
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:05,710
your hand up okay and again same thing

1071
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,700
so if you're from the UK grew up in the

1072
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:12,309
UK significant outside the UK hand down

1073
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,288
okay interesting so the answer to this

1074
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:15,839
is that this is just a comedy duo that

1075
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:17,950
called Reeves and Mortimer

1076
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,650
but you notice with this one I've kind

1077
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,598
of edited the image a little bit and the

1078
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,880
reason I've done that in this example is

1079
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:26,079
that if you reverse image search that

1080
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,940
image you get the answer straight away

1081
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,619
Google tells you what the answer is if

1082
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,500
you mess with the image a little bit and

1083
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:35,289
manipulate it then you can't tell any

1084
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:39,059
more from Google what the answer is okay

1085
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:42,240
do we have any Americans in the audience

1086
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:45,369
one okay do you know who this guy is

1087
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,828
okay that works hundred percent success

1088
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,329
rate

1089
00:41:46,829 --> 00:41:52,680
does anyone who's not American know who

1090
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:56,859
this guy is this is an interesting one

1091
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,359
okay so this guy is is from a meme

1092
00:41:56,859 --> 00:41:59,710
actually which is why I was kind of

1093
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:03,190
curious whether this might have spread

1094
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:04,059
beyond America so this guy is Jake from

1095
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,880
State Farm

1096
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:09,999
disarming any bells at anybody yeah but

1097
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,829
again like in the UK we've got no idea

1098
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:14,078
what State Farm is what it means who

1099
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:15,220
Jake is so you can kind of see where I'm

1100
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,809
going with this so you can potentially

1101
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,519
use this as a kind of challenge

1102
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:20,920
if someone's claiming to be from a

1103
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:23,348
particular country to kind of work out

1104
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,170
if they actually are this is a real

1105
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:28,119
interesting example so this one is from

1106
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,799
the film Inglourious Basterds and you'll

1107
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:32,230
be familiar with this one a thing if you

1108
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:34,749
if you haven't seen the film the context

1109
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:37,539
behind this is Michael Fassbender is a

1110
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:39,399
british army officer and he's gone

1111
00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:42,730
undercover as a nazi officer and he's in

1112
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,690
a bar in france and he's trying not to

1113
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,809
give himself away

1114
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:48,970
he's just ordered three glasses for

1115
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:52,539
whiskey but what he's forgotten is that

1116
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:54,038
in germany you order three glasses so he

1117
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,599
kind of gives himself away there but

1118
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,019
again something that someone kind of

1119
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,849
outside you know of that culture of that

1120
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:04,238
country of that region wouldn't

1121
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:05,619
necessarily get so there are kind of

1122
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,619
other examples you could use for this as

1123
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:10,359
well food so roy out with cheese is the

1124
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,769
example there but things like music and

1125
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,170
cultural norms that kind of thing as

1126
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:16,538
well so i want to kind of run through a

1127
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,009
case study of this being used in the

1128
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:19,839
wild and this wasn't me that did this

1129
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:24,039
this was someone else using this

1130
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:27,690
technique to potentially identify a

1131
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:29,950
suspicious hostile twitter account so I

1132
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:31,720
haven't kind of put the Twitter account

1133
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,879
name here but when you search it on one

1134
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,649
of these services it says that it's

1135
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,109
probably you know it's involved in some

1136
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,999
kind of troll activity but it's probably

1137
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:41,259
not automated it probably is a human

1138
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:44,509
behind it

1139
00:43:41,259 --> 00:43:47,329
this was the question this person posed

1140
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:49,339
to this account this account claims to

1141
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,289
be British it came sort of lived in

1142
00:43:49,339 --> 00:43:57,759
Britain for 50 years it's posting some

1143
00:43:51,289 --> 00:44:00,650
very very dedicated committed Pro brexit

1144
00:43:57,759 --> 00:44:05,779
material and propaganda and this is the

1145
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:09,769
question posed so a UK specific example

1146
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:11,539
and just for the sake of fun let's try

1147
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:13,600
it try again so put your hand up if you

1148
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,820
know the answer

1149
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,650
okay and keeping your hands up if you're

1150
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:20,580
from the UK significant about time in

1151
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,580
the UK hands down

1152
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:31,680
one has you you again okay so this is a

1153
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:34,440
it's actually a character characters

1154
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,529
from a TV show that's better forgotten

1155
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,540
probably but yeah we'll leave that there

1156
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,730
so these are the responses so the

1157
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,070
account that's posted the challenge is

1158
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,950
the account in the top left with the the

1159
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,390
Connick brown-red profile picture the

1160
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,419
account that they're targeting is the

1161
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,009
account with the blue Chelsea flag and

1162
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,950
you can sell apologize for the language

1163
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,570
that that account is using but what this

1164
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,069
challenger has done is they've posted

1165
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,690
this picture and this is a these are

1166
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,940
some examples of the conversation that's

1167
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,910
happened afterwards and you can see that

1168
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,339
the the account that's got the Chelsea

1169
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,520
flag he's consistently refusing to

1170
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:12,740
answer the question to provide an answer

1171
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,220
and they're getting kind of pretty

1172
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,220
aggressive about it

1173
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,440
and what's really interesting is the one

1174
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:23,989
on the bottom left where they say I know

1175
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,579
who they both are I'm just not going to

1176
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:28,700
tell you and then kind of uses a lot of

1177
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:30,559
profanity which suggests possibly the

1178
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,180
back account here's one that maybe needs

1179
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:36,829
further investigation in terms of where

1180
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:38,749
it's actually being operated from so you

1181
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:41,509
could use this as a kind of verification

1182
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:43,549
system for possibly accounts that have

1183
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,170
been reported as false or hostile or

1184
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:48,410
something like that

1185
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:52,690
not just for a brexit in the UK but also

1186
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:54,920
for political elections for any kind of

1187
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:58,910
influencing operation that may or may

1188
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:00,470
not be going on okay

1189
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,450
so there are some caveats to using that

1190
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:05,419
so firstly you're relying on very

1191
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:08,058
specific cultural knowledge some of that

1192
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,789
may be age dependent and it may become

1193
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:13,759
increasingly difficult to find examples

1194
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:16,819
that are the kind of younger generations

1195
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,609
get as kind of globalization increases

1196
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:22,788
and people kind of you know connectivity

1197
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:25,279
across the world increases users might

1198
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:27,200
genuinely not know the answer even if

1199
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,880
they're you know for example from the UK

1200
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,718
just because they didn't watch a lot of

1201
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,099
TV or that kind of thing and in that

1202
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,690
case it might be similar to genuine

1203
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:37,999
captures sometimes you just genuinely

1204
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,410
won't know the answer to one there's

1205
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:40,968
also the problem that you don't want

1206
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,109
those images to be searchable inline as

1207
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:43,519
I mentioned earlier so you have to do

1208
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:46,640
some kind of manipulation and stuff as

1209
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:49,008
well so in terms of what you can do with

1210
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,069
it with this now as I mentioned this is

1211
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:53,539
very experimental stuff it's never been

1212
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:57,380
kind of tested in the wild to see how

1213
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:58,430
effective it might be at scale so it's

1214
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,060
something that needs some further

1215
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,190
research

1216
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,740
in terms of her resilience it would be

1217
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:07,200
what whether the use cases would

1218
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,870
actually you know merit using this this

1219
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,640
technique and an interesting kind of

1220
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,580
slide area of research potentially for

1221
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,650
this would be around clique farmworkers

1222
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,160
and catfish accounts and that kind of

1223
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,840
thing if they're kind of paid to pretend

1224
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,879
to be from a particular culture or a

1225
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,260
particular country how much research

1226
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,090
they actually do and how much background

1227
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,760
information they're given or they learn

1228
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:32,570
about about the country so that could be

1229
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:36,660
an interesting area for future research

1230
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:38,100
so key takeaways so the human side

1231
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,100
channels we've talked about forensic

1232
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,259
linguistics and behavioral signatures

1233
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,580
potentially cultural captures as well

1234
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,980
often kind of under explored in a

1235
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:49,440
cybersecurity context a little bit

1236
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,930
unconventional and multidisciplinary but

1237
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,030
sometimes they can offer cost-effective

1238
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:55,950
opportunities for both attribution and

1239
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,470
investigation and defense as well

1240
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,720
potentially they're often thought of as

1241
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:03,359
very specialist areas so linguistic

1242
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,709
statistics that kind of thing but

1243
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,270
hopefully as you've seen the barrier to

1244
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,950
entry isn't necessarily that higher

1245
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:10,470
there are kind of tools and stuff that

1246
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,180
you can download and use now that a

1247
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:15,149
pretty user-friendly that you can kind

1248
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,160
of play with and experiment with and

1249
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:19,529
kind of see how how useful those

1250
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:23,649
techniques might be to you

1251
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:25,359
there are some definitely a lot of areas

1252
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:27,308
of future research around human side

1253
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,719
channels so expanding the privet

1254
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:30,459
concepts and the techniques that I've

1255
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,089
shown you here may be looking at other

1256
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:35,529
possible human side channels as well

1257
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:39,729
further research into cultural captures

1258
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:41,349
in terms of scope and viability it would

1259
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:44,678
be really interesting to hear if anybody

1260
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:46,149
either has already or would use or is

1261
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,799
planning to use things like forensic

1262
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:49,479
linguistics or behavioral signatures in

1263
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,788
actual incident response work or threat

1264
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:54,428
intelligence work and if so what the

1265
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:55,749
results of that would be automating some

1266
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:59,140
of this stuff particularly the case

1267
00:48:55,749 --> 00:49:01,118
linkage analysis work as well so if

1268
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,759
you're interested in that then get in

1269
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,989
touch more than happy to have a chat and

1270
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:06,369
potentially collaborate if you're

1271
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:08,979
interested in doing that as my email

1272
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:11,529
address and my Twitter as well or send

1273
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:12,009
me a DM or something and we can chat

1274
00:49:11,529 --> 00:49:13,869
about it

1275
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:15,849
just to go back to the aims from the

1276
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:18,279
beginning of this talk hopefully these

1277
00:49:15,849 --> 00:49:19,719
have been met so being aware of three

1278
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:21,359
human side channels how they work some

1279
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,199
practical takeaways for each one

1280
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,969
implications for security and privacy

1281
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,809
possible countermeasures and some ideas

1282
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:29,289
for future research as well so that's it

1283
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:30,899
for me

1284
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:34,359
thank you very much again for listening

1285
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:38,439
again any questions or anything you can

1286
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:40,989
contact me on those two or I will take

1287
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:42,060
some questions down but yeah thank you

1288
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:45,469
very much

1289
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,469
[Applause]

1290
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,550
