00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,110
so bear with me I'm gonna have to refer

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,689
to some of my speaker notes here only

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,329
because I'm an extreme introvert and

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,859
this is very difficult for me so shout

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:41,460
out to all my introverts in the audience

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:43,859
who can do this so I'll spend 30 seconds

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,600
telling you about me I'm currently the

13
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,789
director of security engineering at

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,309
trusts building out my own security

15
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,069
practice at a company that focuses on

16
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,568
software infrastructure and security

17
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:59,190
familiar with the US government don't

18
00:00:54,569 --> 00:01:00,870
boo me I didn't do what's wrong now but

19
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,818
I worked for NASA securing instrument

20
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,369
and ground systems and then I worked for

21
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:07,860
digital delivery services organization

22
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,830
within the federal space building out

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,500
infrastructure in AWS at 18f so my

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,240
backgrounds in these things Incident

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,590
Response pentesting malware analysis we

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,589
can go through the thing but I do

27
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,780
security things so I'll tell you bats

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,790
are amazing and my handle is bath that

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,250
doesn't mean I think I'm amazing I just

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,790
really like bats the animal not the

31
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,770
weapon comic book sir boss so I'm going

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,990
to hit again tomorrow and find all the

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,720
comic book shops and I did come through

34
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,280
all your chocolate so if you know of a

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,840
good place hit me up after and let me

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,460
know where to find those so the title of

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,930
the talk comes from this quote it's an

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,169
African proverb it takes a village to

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,900
raise a child the idea is that a

40
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,300
community has to come together to bring

41
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,970
up the younger folks within the village

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,360
that's kind of where it comes from we in

43
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,800
security have our own village and I

44
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,890
don't know about you but I'd like to

45
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,140
retire someday so it's up to us to make

46
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,970
sure newcomers like learn what they need

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,489
to do so that we can pass the torch at

48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,680
some point there's also this saying that

49
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,530
the best way to get promoted is to hire

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,400
and train your replacement so you can

51
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,900
keep that in mind

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,030
and you can argue with me about it later

53
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,640
if you wanted to okay so today hard to

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,769
wake up on Saturday or Friday mornings

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,349
after the party last night I guess so

56
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:33,000
I added a game to my keynote I don't

57
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,798
know we'll see what happens but

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,260
basically every one of my section

59
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,730
headers has some song lyrics and I'll

60
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,810
give you like 5 seconds to raise your

61
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,879
hand if you know where the song came

62
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,470
from please participate because this is

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,720
really hard for me and I need you like

64
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:51,120
to be involved it'll help me help you so

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,049
we'll do like a quick instructional the

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,400
Sun is up I'm a mess who knows anyone oh

67
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,209
no see this might not translate well

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,450
because us music and we'll say

69
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,359
chandelier by SIA 2014 right do you feel

70
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,909
me on this no no okay so what you'll

71
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:10,799
have at the end of this also is a

72
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:14,459
ridiculous incoherent playlist that you

73
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,810
can download to your iPods later alright

74
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,120
so we're going to talk about the talent

75
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,400
pipeline works been sent our way that

76
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,459
could last a lifetime

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:28,440
anyone know I thought you liked music

78
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,910
alright pipeline by Depeche Mode in 1983

79
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,910
it's a really good song you should

80
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:37,379
download it so jobs we'll start with the

81
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,989
pipeline and this is kind of where we're

82
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:42,358
going with the with the morning here

83
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:45,209
I pulled an article from Forbes that

84
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,280
talked about this security pipeline 2020

85
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,519
one three and a half million unfilled

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,319
cyber security positions so what do you

87
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,530
think that means for those of us working

88
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:03,988
in security overtime job security yeah I

89
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:07,949
like the glass is half-full attitude now

90
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,389
it's coming if if your if your team

91
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:12,060
needs three people and you're the only

92
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,169
person like stuff still broken the work

93
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,310
still has to be done who's gonna do it I

94
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,539
mean unless you're like a sociopath

95
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,738
you're probably going to do the work

96
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,710
great

97
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,810
and everyone gets a shell so you get

98
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,388
hopefully you just feel me on that one

99
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,940
if you're down three people on your blue

100
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:32,970
team somebody's probably getting the

101
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,979
shell and I added this little bit about

102
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,530
relying on technology to solve a people

103
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,139
problem I'm not going to talk too much

104
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,500
about AI but HR is trying to solve the

105
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,930
problem right with tech and I'll talk

106
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,150
about why that's not working so well in

107
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,620
just a little while recruiting come on

108
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,349
what you're looking for has been here

109
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,020
the whole time

110
00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:04,860
what meatloaf no no no there's like a

111
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,960
thing I would say drink you belong with

112
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,580
me taylor swift own tailor swift in

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,609
belgium no i don't love her so much

114
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,800
either but this is a great song alright

115
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,509
so the challenge is with recruiting and

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,820
i'm gonna give you this with the caveat

117
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,130
i don't know the answer to a lot of

118
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,020
these problems but i think it's

119
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,030
important that we frame out the

120
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,130
challenges so that we can just we can

121
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,080
start to tackle them it's it's like the

122
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,539
engineering part of my brain like what

123
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,090
problem are we trying to solve do we get

124
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:35,250
user stories oh god it's turning into a

125
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,799
calm on board I mean I can like digress

126
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,130
all day but there are a lot of

127
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,139
challenges and so let's talk about some

128
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,099
of them budgets I can't fix your budgets

129
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,789
sorry

130
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:52,229
and who in here I guess raise your hand

131
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:59,039
if you think that your company has an

132
00:05:52,229 --> 00:06:01,919
ample budget for security three four

133
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,789
five great okay

134
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,620
raise your hand if you're screwed I mean

135
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,659
it's just kind of the nature of it right

136
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,360
budgets are budgets and and some of this

137
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:14,520
is like a cultural piece right that that

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,520
companies are still investing in sales

139
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,389
and selling the thing but not realizing

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:26,310
that we need to do sort of a balanced

141
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:28,979
approach to security hiring as well so

142
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,289
company reputation this is a challenge

143
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,159
in hiring if you're CTO has a reputation

144
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,150
for

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,770
abusive we all talk to each other we

146
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,539
know people aren't going to apply your

147
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,430
company it's just kind of a thing the

148
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,130
hunting grounds so with this I'm

149
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,860
thinking a lot of companies tend to seek

150
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,630
out those in the u.s. it's called back

151
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,940
the Big Ten schools right the Ivy League

152
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:58,500
schools the best universities or the

153
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,300
best corporations there they're

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:06,150
searching for talent in these places

155
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,650
that that they think have the top talent

156
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,330
right because for whatever reason these

157
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,739
these schools are ranked really high and

158
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:15,359
it's not that that's not a valid way to

159
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,340
do things there are a lot of places that

160
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,490
we can search for talent other than

161
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,460
these normal go to big companies big

162
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,590
universities distributed teams have

163
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,260
become a challenge in our space you know

164
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,989
five years ago maybe I don't know we we

165
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,630
debated this a little bit yesterday but

166
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:34,980
definitely ten years ago you didn't see

167
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:38,490
security folks come up and say I wanna

168
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:41,250
be remote has a job requirement right or

169
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:46,350
I don't want to travel a lot or I don't

170
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:48,180
want to work in an office I mean we SSH

171
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,640
into everything anyway for the most part

172
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,940
right there is I'm not dismissing the

173
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,250
need for four butts in seats we'll say

174
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,750
but for the most part we've got a larger

175
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,690
community entering the workforce that

176
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,270
expect to be able to work distributed or

177
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,040
at least have the option to that's a

178
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,849
challenge for companies that are still

179
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,710
culturally living in a space where

180
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,520
managers want butts and seats right

181
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,989
leaders just want good talent so you

182
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,469
know we have to think about that mind

183
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:23,190
shift and then job descriptions in the

184
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:27,000
in the ten six ratio so so there was a

185
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,890
study out of HP and then Forbes took it

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,480
a step farther and then you know another

187
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,340
polling organization took it even

188
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,010
farther and I've put some references for

189
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,410
you and in my slide deck for the

190
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,460
takeaway but but essentially what it

191
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,350
says is when you write out your job

192
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,050
descriptions

193
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:45,330
men and this is grossly gendered and I'm

194
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,550
sorry but this is what we're gonna do

195
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,590
right now so men tend to apply for jobs

196
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,650
if they meet about 60% of the

197
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,800
requirements on a job description that's

198
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:57,750
reasonable right what we tend to see is

199
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,020
women and minorities applying for jobs

200
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,450
only if they meet like 95 percent to a

201
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,650
hundred percent of the job requirements

202
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,800
so if you think about the way that

203
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,470
you're writing your job descriptions we

204
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,750
all want that like black unicorn right

205
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,150
the person who can come in and and Java

206
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,010
and Perl and Ruby and but do you really

207
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,620
need that like or do you just need one

208
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,980
person who can write tools in one

209
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,710
language right so we have to think about

210
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,570
the the way we're doing that okay let's

211
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,820
talk about unconscious bias and just get

212
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:34,200
it over with I think there's a Fault in

213
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:37,140
my code anyone palsy yay

214
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,460
your prize is that you get to know that

215
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,990
you're smarter than everyone else in the

216
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:47,130
room right now but only for like the

217
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:48,810
next 30 seconds so that's gasoline by

218
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,000
housing it's really good song if you

219
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,469
don't know it's it's good all right so

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,790
unconscious bias I'm not gonna read

221
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:59,520
these things to you you know this stuff

222
00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:03,630
exists it just does I will admit that in

223
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,510
the u.s. we may face different types of

224
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,460
bias and you face here in Europe and so

225
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,170
I'm not going to speak to those because

226
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,490
I don't know I don't live here and I

227
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,380
don't know what you're facing day today

228
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,780
but I can tell you that I've never been

229
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:22,890
anywhere that these things didn't all

230
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:25,170
exist in some form so I'm gonna say the

231
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,790
first four just suck travel heard not to

232
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,990
do that I don't know what else to say

233
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,550
for stereotypes that's a subtle one and

234
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm gonna tell you a story about one of

235
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,349
my friends because it just seems like a

236
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,790
good way to kind of talk about

237
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:46,020
stereotypes she became the first female

238
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,480
red teamer at her security firm and we

239
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,660
were all so excited for and she's like

240
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,610
jamming it out writing tools popping

241
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:59,100
shells like she has a mentor

242
00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:02,339
everything's going great until her team

243
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,870
sort of has a social breakdown I don't

244
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,610
know if I have a lot of pin testers in

245
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,450
the room or folks who work with pin

246
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,390
testers I mean we can be kind of hard to

247
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,690
work with sometimes right I was just

248
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:18,689
just gonna put that out there so her

249
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,040
managers solution was to pull her out of

250
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:23,279
her pen test role where she was very

251
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,860
happy and asked her to be the project

252
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,160
manager that handled the red team for

253
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:34,860
three months until they were able to

254
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:39,839
bring in another project manager so

255
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,399
what's this done to her right the work

256
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,640
that she enjoyed doing she's not doing

257
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,870
now this other burden has been placed on

258
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
her shoulders and we'll call it

259
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,740
emotional labor that all of a sudden

260
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,329
because she was the woman on the team

261
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,220
and because she was friendly and she got

262
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,380
along with everyone they thought oh well

263
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,880
we'll just move her out of the role that

264
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,560
she's doing that's a very technical that

265
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,800
she'd say come fluent and I'm moving

266
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,380
into this place where she's solving what

267
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,969
is ultimately a team and human resources

268
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,110
problem and that's not what she signed

269
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,079
up for and that's not what she's getting

270
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,870
paid to do and that's like a subtle

271
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,729
stereotype right that she could fix it

272
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,350
because she's a woman and and she can

273
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,579
get all these guys to be nice because

274
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,240
they're mean to each other but they

275
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:23,760
won't be mean to her and shitty fun all

276
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,040
right because now all the things she was

277
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,810
excited about doing or put on hold and

278
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,529
her career is essentially put on hold

279
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,209
until they decide to bring in a PM and

280
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:37,800
what if that person can't solve the

281
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:40,170
problem right so tribalism tribalism is

282
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:45,689
a little different in the way that it

283
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:47,729
manifests in our culture and this is

284
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,500
gonna seem like such a weird question to

285
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,370
ask right but can all my introverts

286
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,370
raise their hands

287
00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:00,459
so this is the thing introverts don't I

288
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,589
know so myself speaking for myself

289
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:07,750
through my own filter I don't mean to be

290
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,459
tribalists I just tend to flock toward

291
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,529
the people that I already know and that

292
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:16,119
I'm already comfortable being around and

293
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:18,880
comfortable talking to but how do you

294
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,010
think that the the junior or the intern

295
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,889
in the room who really just wanted to

296
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:27,130
ask me a question feels when they see me

297
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:29,470
kind of flock to my people like do you

298
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,320
think they're gonna come up and and

299
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,500
interrupt me or try to talk to me what

300
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,610
if they're an introvert too so there's a

301
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:42,490
breakdown in communication and and so

302
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,649
tribalism not to be confused with being

303
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,440
an introvert but just be aware that

304
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:52,570
sometimes it can feel that way to your

305
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,459
spectators let's talk about networking

306
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,040
and some of the challenges in our

307
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:59,560
pipeline and things that we can look at

308
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,939
oh I get by with a little help from my

309
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,989
friends if you don't know this I'm just

310
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:10,630
quitting I'm not stopping until somebody

311
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,040
answers Beatles thank you finally so

312
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:20,079
that what it is I needed to pull in a

313
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:22,750
European okay so 1968 a title decide

314
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,670
homey don't you know me right like how

315
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,370
many people have gotten a job because

316
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,899
somebody referred them or because they

317
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,790
knew somebody that already worked at the

318
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:32,589
place and you don't have to know them

319
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,209
personally right maybe you met them on

320
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,389
Twitter or maybe you met them on

321
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,380
LinkedIn I don't know maybe you met them

322
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,019
through your best friend's girlfriend

323
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,769
like who knows but networking is a big

324
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:46,389
deal it builds trust so if two people

325
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:51,069
come in off the street to apply for a

326
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:53,410
job and I have one open spot I'm

327
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:56,829
probably gonna give the interview to the

328
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,420
person that has with has been referred

329
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,859
by a colleague that I know in respect

330
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,599
who may have even worked with the person

331
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,829
in the past and that's just the way it

332
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,040
is again not sure how things work here

333
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:11,349
but in the United States we have this

334
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,130
thing called USAJOBS and it's our portal

335
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:17,290
for federal work if you just hold apply

336
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,850
into USAJOBS your application can sit

337
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,420
there for years without anyone looking

338
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,630
at it and so people think it's very very

339
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,269
hard to get a government job but if your

340
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:31,180
friend is already a Fed or a federal

341
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:34,480
employee and hands your resume to their

342
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,910
boss like you're in the part about

343
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,350
applying through USAJOBS happens at the

344
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,339
end when they're ready to hire you and

345
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,250
they just need to capture your

346
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:47,920
information and right across the t's dot

347
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:51,300
the i's referral bonuses fall into

348
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,920
networking why do you think that is

349
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,670
does anyone's company here have referral

350
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,920
bonuses do you know what these are right

351
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:04,029
you you bring your friend over they get

352
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,019
the job taking a job you get a bonus

353
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,360
it's win-win right what if you come in

354
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,760
and you suck and you're like the worst

355
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,730
and your friend referred you like what

356
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:21,399
does that do to their reputation right

357
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:23,139
no bueno so if you can find a way to

358
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,819
network and make friends or

359
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:29,500
acquaintances business contacts whatever

360
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,860
it's a win-win for them if they can

361
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,819
refer you for a job right everyone

362
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,529
everyone kind of understand what I'm

363
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,540
saying there so I'm speaking a little

364
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,040
bit to the hiring managers in the room

365
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,019
right now if your company doesn't offer

366
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,459
a referral bonus program you're probably

367
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,519
missing out on some talent that you

368
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,959
didn't even know was available right and

369
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,510
when your friends are out of work in

370
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,149
looking you're the first ones to know

371
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,769
right like what do you have so keep that

372
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:59,550
kind of that kind of thing in mind as a

373
00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:02,290
as a good networking tool social media

374
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:07,809
this is our world I'm not on Facebook

375
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,550
really but LinkedIn I am endorsed for

376
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,500
cheese and sweaters my LinkedIn is not

377
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,799
serious okay like it's ridiculous I'm

378
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,199
also endorsed for Wizardry

379
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,730
but in most companies LinkedIn is kind

380
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,459
of the first place your employer will

381
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,589
check to see where you've worked before

382
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,659
it's a bonus if people have already

383
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,609
written little recommendations for you

384
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:29,260
in those fields and linked and it kind

385
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,120
of lets them know that oh you actually

386
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,720
aren't lying and you did have a job at

387
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,850
that place

388
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,350
twitter twitter is a great place for

389
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,049
like information security professionals

390
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:43,779
to to collaborate to talk to each other

391
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:47,320
to fight to post memes to be awful you

392
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,669
know like yeah we digress sucks but

393
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,639
Twitter is a good place to like meet

394
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:53,289
other security professionals so think

395
00:17:51,639 --> 00:17:55,750
about those those things as you're

396
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,250
building out your online presence and it

397
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,519
sucks and if you're a security person

398
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,350
with no social media cool but what I'm

399
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,940
saying is that potential employer is

400
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,918
gonna try to look you up they're gonna

401
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,200
do recon before they bring you in like

402
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,740
it's just a thing so for better or for

403
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,350
worse like be ready to stand by whatever

404
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,340
like awful meme you post it on Twitter

405
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,990
right cuz your potential boss may see it

406
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,908
I've posted some terrible ones and I

407
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,149

419
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,059
hiring looking sticker but it's a good

420
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,320
way to find your counterpart and just

421
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:55,600

429
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,260
don't do this too often in this talk

430
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,399
today but I have some tips for employers

431
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,789
and then I'll have some tips for people

432
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,100
who are looking so focus on your brand

433
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,450
so for my employers and folks

434
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,449
representing their companies in this

435
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,549
room branding has always been kind of a

436
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:35,470
marketing term right we think of it in

437
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:37,779
terms of logo and you know websites and

438
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,149
you know we're moving past that for

439
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,989
branding now when I talk about branding

440
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:46,178
I'm talking about your company's culture

441
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,049
your company's values are they listed on

442
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,639
your website

443
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:54,279
it sounds very soft skilosh but I can

444
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:56,590
tell you that underrepresented groups

445
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,710
and Technology are checking your

446
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,809
websites and and they are looking for

447
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,879
some sort of statement of company values

448
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:09,389
some sort of statement about culture

449
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:15,699
even some statement about families

450
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:18,459
benefits employees are doing recon on

451
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:23,739
your companies as well so just be aware

452
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,509
of that your job descriptions you

453
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:26,950
probably need to go back and like half

454
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,559
of you should go back and rewrite half

455
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,599
your job descriptions there are some

456
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:33,190
little things that you can do in your

457
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,309
job descriptions to attract more talent

458
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:41,710
like it's just proven there's languages

459
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:44,289
there's I have freezing there even tools

460
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,700
out there if you're you know a tech nerd

461
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:47,950
like I am that'll help you there's a

462
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:52,570
tool called text EO and it'll scan your

463
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,970
job description for little flags that

464
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,220
may make your your description of the

465
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,070
position seem biased so here's an

466
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,080
example did you know that if you put

467
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:05,200
sports references in your job

468
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,499
description consciously or unconsciously

469
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,080
it kind of turns people who aren't into

470
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:12,849
sports off so if you are like we're

471
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,789
gonna knock it out of the park or a par

472
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:18,158
for the course like if you're not really

473
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:19,690
into sports you're just like what kind

474
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,169
of culture is this I don't want to go

475
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:26,440
and and talk about sports all day it's

476
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,659
just a thing and with the phrasing that

477
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,609
there are some mistakes that you're

478
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:31,929
making in job descriptions because you

479
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:33,830
want to find the person who knows

480
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:38,390
everything about everything and

481
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:40,460
we all I do so let's say you have an

482
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,220
open position and you list that you are

483
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,309
looking for someone who knows well how

484
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,630
do you put it you'll put proficient in

485
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:52,639
Python Java Ruby and Swift do you really

486
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,350
need that from one person do you really

487
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,750
mean that do you want somebody who's

488
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,340
like okay at all four or do you want

489
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,700
somebody who's really good at one

490
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,350
because I mean at the end of the day you

491
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,450
can build the tool in any language you

492
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,309
want as long as the tool works like I

493
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,710
don't care what language you write it in

494
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,428
so maybe you just a simple word change

495
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,019
from and or would open up the pool of

496
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,029
applicants that then feel like they

497
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:19,250
should apply to the position and this

498
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:22,190
goes back to that ten six ratio right

499
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,710
if I see that you want all four of these

500
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,840
languages and you have the end like I'm

501
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,269
not qualified for that role but maybe I

502
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,129
was maybe that was just your laundry

503
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:33,049
list looking for like your magical

504
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,049
security fairy you could come and do all

505
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:39,710
these magical things those folks are

506
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:42,049
rare and then taking chances so that's

507
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:44,269
that's part of it right like what if you

508
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:47,120
switch to or what if you interview

509
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,279
someone who only wants to code in one

510
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,268
language what if you think outside that

511
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,279
box of this strict formula that you've

512
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:57,380
had for the last ten years and hiring

513
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:59,179
and realize that the landscape is

514
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,409
changed and you've got to change with it

515
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,269
or you're not going to attract the

516
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:06,919
talent so for my job seekers in the room

517
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:08,419
I will make you raise your hand but you

518
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,080
could get one of those stickers and find

519
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:14,419
each other do your research so this is a

520
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,769
recon piece that I was talking about you

521
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:20,480
know I'm not dismissing that that we all

522
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:22,429
reach points of desperation where we

523
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,669
find ourselves unemployed I need to just

524
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:28,789
like find a job right like I've

525
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:31,730
bartended between finding the job that

526
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:33,799
was on my career path it's a thing I'm

527
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,470
not talking about that piece talking

528
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,929
about if you kind of have the luxury to

529
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:41,510
to look around for a job or your senior

530
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,190
in college and you're trying to to think

531
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,930
about what's next or you feel

532
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,890
underemployed under

533
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,680
valued in your current role but you have

534
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,210
a job it's a little bit easier to find a

535
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,430
job when you already have one there's

536
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,480
there's some kind of conscious thing

537
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,420
that's happening in your brain that

538
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,970
makes that possible but do your research

539
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:07,360
look for those things like culture

540
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:10,910
values benefits is it important to you

541
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,560
this also can speak back to phrasing one

542
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,400
of the other things that I've seen

543
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:20,960
lately on benefits sites is companies

544
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:25,580
offering maternity leave okay but what

545
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,920
happens is you're a male male couple and

546
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,679
you see this place has maternity leave

547
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,490
what happens if your life is the

548
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:36,860
breadwinner and you're thinking about

549
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:40,490
staying home for a little while but it

550
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:43,459
says only maternity leave right so a

551
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,920
simple shift in maternity leave versus

552
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,890
family leave right could attract more

553
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,120
talent so for folks looking if this is

554
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,000
important to you look for that word

555
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,580
family leave you know if if that's

556
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,010
important to you tune up your resume

557
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,710
practice interviewing I'm gonna give you

558
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:02,540
a link at the end to my really horrible

559
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:06,620
website and the only thing on it is the

560
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:10,720
link to my github repo what I've done is

561
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:13,969
build out a workshop that partners

562
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,060
mentors with mentees in the security

563
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:22,580
space for hiring managers to help folks

564
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:26,510
tune up their resumes right get past the

565
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:30,050
keyword filters add the relevant

566
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,790
experience practice interviewing how

567
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,740
many people in the room nailed their

568
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:38,120
first job interview just like nailed it

569
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,070
right good job man that's great for you

570
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,300
for the rest of us who went home and

571
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,000
cried and thought about all the things

572
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,730
we should have said yeah I that's I feel

573
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,070
like oh and then how many people like

574
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,770
sent the email after oh I forgot to tell

575
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,659
you I I realized the answer to this

576
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,550
technical question after we hung up the

577
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,080
phone and then the hiring manager is

578
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,510
like you know you googled that show like

579
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,350
on

580
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,900
you did you went right to stack overflow

581
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,100
so practicing though it'll help you

582
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:09,540
understanding the question so in that in

583
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,399
that framework I've got on my github

584
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,590
repo there's there's also sample

585
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,570
questions now for cultural pieces

586
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,030
technical pieces whatever you feel like

587
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:22,590
your weakness is in that area it's never

588
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:25,080
good to try and plug it again at the end

589
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,360
but the goal of this framework is for

590
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,520
you to go out into the world and take

591
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,918
the framework to your own conferences

592
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,610
communities workspaces and help each

593
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,470
other and then the same thing take

594
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,120
chances go with your gut so the go with

595
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,710
your gut piece is let's say you're in

596
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,330
the very fortunate position that you're

597
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,590
offered two jobs at the same time has

598
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,840
that anything happened to anyone in the

599
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,490
room they get multiple offers at one

600
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,500
time it happens right because we're

601
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,630
applying to a lot of places when we're

602
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,130
we finally like said okay I'm gonna do

603
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,040
this my resume is awesome

604
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,750
you throw a wide net right but then oh

605
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,879
shit now you have to make a decision how

606
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,919
do you make it so that's this go with

607
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:07,500
your gut piece and and that's really all

608
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:10,559
it is if it's a job and it pays you know

609
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,230
twenty thousand more than this other job

610
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,580
is your knee-jerk to take it because you

611
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,840
need money but what if this other job

612
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,970
really lays out there mentorship

613
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,299
programs a professional development plan

614
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:27,120
and show a real commitment to your

615
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:32,460
growth in your career rather than just

616
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:34,229
paying you for a job right you're gonna

617
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,210
have everyone in the room will probably

618
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,590
have a different spin on that or a

619
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,940
different type of answer for that but

620
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:42,389
it's something to think about you just

621
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:45,059
have to kind of at some point go with it

622
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,380
right the choice not made is the one

623
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:51,480
you're given so don't take too long

624
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,059
alright so hiring come on give me a

625
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,220
break will you

626
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:58,610
anybody no no I just I'm gonna give up

627
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,270
on my game take a chance on me

628
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,070
adda 1978 I'm looking forward to seeing

629
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:08,629
you all like increase the downloads of

630
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:12,350
these particular songs right so hiring

631
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:14,210
challenges hmm your budget remember that

632
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:17,750
thing I can't fix your budget hiring

633
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,630
cost a lot of money think about how much

634
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:24,740
money your folks make and then how much

635
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:26,059
time spent during interviews that's

636
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,460
money that you're paying them that

637
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:30,649
they're not actually doing the job that

638
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,840
you hired them to do right interviewing

639
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,309
cost money

640
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,899
recruiting cost money if you're doing it

641
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:41,330
right it's gonna cost you some cash and

642
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,799
let's say you hire the person onboarding

643
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:48,980
costs money right who's seen in in a job

644
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:52,010
interview or a job description that term

645
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,900
hit the ground running anyway I think

646
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,970
that term is such a bullshit no one hits

647
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,179
the ground running right like unless

648
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,640
you're maybe in a different field where

649
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:04,700
like here's your job move this bottle to

650
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,880
this like you don't hit a security job

651
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,400
running like it's just not a thing you

652
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:14,840
access who got access the first day at

653
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:18,950
their company right because you set it

654
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:21,860
up yourself Rob alright so human

655
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:25,070
resources is a challenge and again I

656
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,620
don't know how this translates here but

657
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,049
in the United States human resources

658
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,059
tend to be like one of the biggest

659
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:34,760
blockers for us actually bringing in

660
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,190
good people so there's this this one

661
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,080
piece with the filters right what's off

662
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,120
the problem with AI we can train the

663
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,309
Machine to spot the key words and the

664
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,659
good resumes okay so I'll tell you like

665
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:49,879
a quick story about that in my

666
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,650
government position with 18f I was a

667
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,690
term employee which meant that I had a

668
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,700
four-year term it was under an Obama

669
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,460
initiative and you finish for four years

670
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,210
and then you're out so as I neared the

671
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:05,140
end of my four years as acting director

672
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:08,149
of infrastructure engineering

673
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:11,899
they found funding to make that position

674
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:13,340
permanent late so they came to me and

675
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:17,239
asked me to write the job description

676
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,428
from my own job and to apply from my own

677
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,740
job through USAJOBS because again the

678
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:27,559
system is so broken and convoluted and

679
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:30,169
about two or three weeks later the

680
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,750
director asked me like my director above

681
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:34,220
me asked why he hadn't seen my resume

682
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,659
and the pipeline yet was I not

683
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:41,260
interested in the position okay so fill

684
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:44,419
me here I wrote the Job Description

685
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,419
based off my own resume and submitted it

686
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:52,570
and I didn't get through HR filters for

687
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:58,220
my own job what hope do any of you have

688
00:30:52,570 --> 00:31:01,039
right so in that in those my github repo

689
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,990
I have some keyword things that you

690
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,379
should add to your resume and I'm

691
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,149
telling you you should like research

692
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:10,309
really read the Job Description and if

693
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:12,529
you notice any words that sort of stand

694
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,539
out to you in the Job Description figure

695
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:16,010
out a way to work them into your resume

696
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,019
because it's like the reality is you

697
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:22,309
have to hack the system which is just

698
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:23,870
weird and then job descriptions like do

699
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:27,168
you feel my theme with job descriptions

700
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,000
yet like so the pipeline when we're

701
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:34,789
thinking about the pipeline the pipeline

702
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,730
starts with what right someone needs a

703
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,980
job the job description is kind of the

704
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,299
first thing they see so if you're joking

705
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,710
at the Job Description like you've

706
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:46,100
you've bottlenecked your whole pipeline

707
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,740
so let's think about ways to open that

708
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:54,320
up so that we get lots of applicants and

709
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,669
we have a different problem right you're

710
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,010
not gonna know I don't even know why I

711
00:31:55,669 --> 00:32:01,010
bother only time will tell if you can

712
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,169
break the spell no one knows Shakespeare

713
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:06,539
sister

714
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:08,820
1992 maybe I'm just dating myself should

715
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:11,509
I've picked more modern music is it a

716
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,399
metal thing did you want metal EBM

717
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:16,619
trance-like what's your deal okay well I

718
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:26,309
blame Larry for not filling me in on

719
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:29,728
this right so why do people leave why do

720
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:33,859
people leave does anyone ever left a job

721
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:37,440
because the money sucked I mean you know

722
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:40,228
that's the thing your work culture you

723
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,769
just couldn't work for that manager one

724
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:47,729
more day or they were gonna just go nuts

725
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:48,509
right who hated their team members do

726
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:49,919
you don't have to raise your hand

727
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,389
especially if your team members are in

728
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,389
the room I encourage you not to raise

729
00:32:51,389 --> 00:32:57,959
your hand

730
00:32:53,389 --> 00:33:00,918
unconscious bias it's a it's a thing and

731
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,759
I only have like us numbers for this but

732
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:08,190
annually in a there's a company that did

733
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,789
a survey base it was like leavers survey

734
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:14,999
or something 10 million at least in

735
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:19,109
America 2 million folks leave their jobs

736
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:21,869
voluntarily every year because they feel

737
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:25,049
like it's either unfair or there's a

738
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:27,149
sense of any of those unconscious bias

739
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:30,599
things that we talked about earlier that

740
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:33,899
were terrible and that translates to

741
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:36,960
billions of dollars in cost either with

742
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,109
lost revenue or reopening the hiring

743
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,409
pipeline each year so we're culture

744
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:46,789
super important it's it's not just a

745
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:50,849
foo-foo soft-skills thing anymore

746
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:52,739
we you know that thing with houses where

747
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:54,178
it's either like a buyers market or a

748
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,429
seller's market and that kind of

749
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:58,710
determines the price right if it's a

750
00:33:56,429 --> 00:34:01,109
seller's market the prices on houses are

751
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,669
just gonna be completely out of control

752
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:06,658
if it's a buyers market the markets

753
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:09,779
flooded with inventory so the cost of

754
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:11,339
housing goes down security professionals

755
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:13,980
remember that number three and a half

756
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,909
million unfilled cyber cyber security

757
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,299
positions and

758
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,750
21 that means that people who know how

759
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:27,299
to do this job to get to write their own

760
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:31,739
ticket right now so mm-hmm they had the

761
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:34,710
luxury and a lot of times a moral duty

762
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:37,558
to focus on companies with a good

763
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:41,480
culture when I took a job after the

764
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:44,879
federal government in the civilian space

765
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:47,639
with a company that I knew to to do work

766
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,159
for the federal government it was

767
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,369
extremely important to me to know that

768
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,349
they wouldn't work with ice so that's a

769
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:58,410
u.s. thing but I don't know if you've

770
00:34:55,349 --> 00:35:03,210
seen we have a little immigration issue

771
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:05,640
right now with like very unkind tactics

772
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,200
being taken to eject immigrants from our

773
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,150
country

774
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,069
it was important to me not to work for a

775
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,500
company that supported that type of

776
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:15,720
treatment of immigrants so it meant the

777
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,760
world to me to find out in an interview

778
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,660
it was one of the questions I asked and

779
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,440
then I knew that that was the place that

780
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,680
could work

781
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,480
but again I had a couple of different

782
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,160
opportunities and I had the luxury so

783
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,660
this won't apply to everyone if you need

784
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,089
a job and you need to feed your family

785
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,000
get the job feed your family but then

786
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,869
you can do all these things right

787
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,400
professional development is super

788
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,770
important how many people now in

789
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,109
interviews ask what the company's plan

790
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,700
for professional development is like do

791
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,578
it maybe you ask it do I get to go to

792
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,169
training job training budget do I get to

793
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:53,160
attend conferences do you support me

794
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:55,190
speaking at conferences work-life

795
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,190
balance

796
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:02,120
who wants to work 90 hours a week Bob

797
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,750
that's just not true maybe you do I

798
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,400
don't know

799
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,690
you saw his keynote yesterday did he

800
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,980
strike you as somebody that would want

801
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:13,400
to work 90 hours a week probably for the

802
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:17,360
rest of us in the US we adhere to a

803
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:22,490
40-hour workweek some companies have 36

804
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:24,980
but the norm is 40 so just as employers

805
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:27,500
expect you to work 40 hours a week to

806
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,480
earn your pay employer should also

807
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,570
expect you to adhere to the 40-hour

808
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:38,720
workweek and not expect you to be nights

809
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:40,730
weekends you know on call 24/7 busting

810
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,060
your tail so that they make their

811
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:45,830
numbers but you're getting paid the same

812
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,840
as someone else who maybe does it here

813
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:51,590
too the 40-hour workweek do you feel me

814
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,300
on this there's like a sense of fairness

815
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,880
there burnout is real one of the

816
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,490
questions that I like to ask my

817
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,870
interviewer and I encourage folks to ask

818
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:04,819
if you make it to that stage where do

819
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,380
you think it's coming together for you

820
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,300
do you know that moment when you feel

821
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,460
like okay this is lining up I've had the

822
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,530
intro I've had the technical review and

823
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,810
then you get to the part where either

824
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,290
Human Resources or maybe the director

825
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:20,330
level asked you you know do you have any

826
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,850
questions for us so great one is when's

827
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:24,920
the last time you took a vacation when's

828
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:28,279
the last time like someone on your team

829
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,290
took a vacation if that team lead says

830
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,950
oh you had spent a couple years man

831
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:38,029

832
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:39,680
out get out right so I asked at my

833
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,750
current job when I asked one of the I

834
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,279
the founder did my last interview you

835
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,170

836
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,760
vacation and he was like oh you know I

837

amazing I'm like that's great music yeah

839
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:53,480
it had been like a year in three months

840
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,250
and then my business partner threatened

841
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,660
to turn off my email if I didn't

842
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,510
schedule a vacation by the end of the

843
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,140
week so I had to go do that

844
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:05,970
and I'm like great that's good and I

845
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:10,000
like to hear that so encouraging

846
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:11,109
work-life balance right professional

847
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,810
development you're not going to know

848
00:38:11,109 --> 00:38:16,660
maybe you will must have been cold

849
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:19,720
they're my shadow you guys never saw

850
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:25,810
beaches it's like the ridiculous sappy

851
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,310
no okay my wings you'll think of this

852
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:30,970
song now today you're welcome

853
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:33,820
it's a terrible song by the way okay so

854
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,490
you get hired now what and I should see

855
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:41,260
how I'm doing on time

856
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:42,368
so talk about your career when you get

857
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,260
to work let's start talking about

858
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:45,730
careers not just the job you're doing

859
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,070
you can talk about the job you're doing

860
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:52,720
certainly but start thinking about ways

861
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:56,350
to like change that conversation right

862
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,299
from job talk to career talk training

863
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,100
and speaking learning teaching all the

864
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,260
things I'll do a quick little plug for

865
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,779
sans anyone attend you to Sam's training

866
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,650
they're really expensive does anyone

867
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:11,440
like had to pay for it themselves no

868
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:12,970
right so you know that's expensive

869
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,950
the other thing called the facilitator

870
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,129
program though and you can attend the

871
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,089
SANS training and do the training and

872
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:21,359
get an exam attempt for the

873
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,560
certification for a fifth of the price

874
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,910
so I just throw that out there for those

875
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,080
of you who are looking or looking to

876
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,080
grow yourselves but have to do it on

877
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,090
your own budget look for inexpensive or

878
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,290
even free training opportunities out in

879
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,420
the community they're out there you just

880
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:37,420
have to look but if you if you think a

881
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,310
cert will help you with the job that you

882
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,710
want to get because it like lists what

883
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:43,210
sorts they want to see and you just

884
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,609
don't have the cash to do it think about

885
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,380
the facilitator program that's all I've

886
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:49,480
done it a few times because the feds had

887
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,430
a three thousand dollar annual budget

888
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,260
for training and one sans training can

889
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,259
be about seven thousand in the u.s. so

890
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:03,850
mentorship please really see you're

891
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,930
dancing you see you feel me there you go

892
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,529
you probably don't know who did it

893
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,370
though do you

894
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,460
[Music]

895
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:14,299
so close we'll give you like a applause

896
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:17,540
for dancing though Rob base and DJ EZ

897
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,400
rock alright so what doesn't work you

898
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,870
enjoy my back pictures yet is anybody

899
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,430
loving backs as much as I am right now

900
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,470
or no you just thought they were ugly

901
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,560
right they're super cute so much

902
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:31,299
personality like sky puppies alright so

903
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:34,520
for mentorship what's not going to work

904
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:39,830
mmm all these things don't work in a

905
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:41,480
mentor mentee relationship if you don't

906
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,850
talk about what the goal of being

907
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,850
mentored is how do you expect to get

908
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:49,370
anything out of it right like you have

909
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,560
to have some conversations about this if

910
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,450
you're not committed to the process and

911
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,520
this is for mentors and mentees in the

912
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,520
room they're not committed it's not

913
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,560
going to work

914
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,940
you have broken promises like how many

915
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,740
people in the room were assigned a

916
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,840
mentor and it just all fell apart

917
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,410
because life happens and you get busy

918
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,730
with work I mean those of us who have

919
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,259
tried to mentor people and we

920
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,650
desperately want to provide that support

921
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,500
for them throw it out of runway right we

922
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:23,540
just no more spoons this is the saying

923
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:25,760
goes quitting after failure well this

924
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,500
mentor mentee thing didn't work so we're

925
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,300
gonna just you know we're gonna

926
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,820
disengage from this program we're gonna

927
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,200
shut it down whatever like ooh that

928
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,640
doesn't help anyone just because like

929
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,200
one pairing didn't work doesn't mean

930
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,980
they won't like another one wouldn't

931
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:41,870
work really well and gatekeeping I just

932
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:44,920
can I assume that everyone knows what I

933
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:47,509
mean when I say gatekeeping I don't

934
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,410
don't try to be that person who decides

935
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:52,970
who does and doesn't belong like just

936
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,560
think of it oh they're not a hacker

937
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,049
because I haven't written an exploit

938
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,940
yeah you know what though they like

939
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:03,200
defend it against these four things and

940
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:05,390
they have a CBE like so don't don't do

941
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,509
that like kind of step outside that that

942
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:10,879
box and just let's assume that everyone

943
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:14,330
belongs and and break out of that place

944
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,579
where there's this like elite mentality

945
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,429
that only us and and then

946
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,449
and we'll talk about that knowing that

947
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:22,880
alright but what works in a mentoring

948
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:24,229
relationship do the opposite of all

949
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,439
those other things I just talked about

950
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:29,359
right and then the capturing failures

951
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,949
piece if a pairing doesn't work if your

952
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,660
mentor program at your organization

953
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,789
doesn't work whether your mentor or a

954
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,828
mentee capture that and bring it to

955
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:40,099
somebody who cares about the mentor

956
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:43,489
program so that you can make change in a

957
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:46,999
positive way to improve the program all

958
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:50,089
right so the us versus them all it does

959
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:53,718
is promote fear and consternation anyone

960
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:59,779
oh you know this one Bad Religion that's

961
00:42:53,719 --> 00:43:03,040
right okay you should download this

962
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:04,959
album if you haven't already all right

963
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,859
[Music]

964
00:43:04,959 --> 00:43:11,390
come on crowd so it's not us versus them

965
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,479
where we now if we're gonna move forward

966
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,249
we have to be a we there's enough pie

967
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:18,319
for everyone do you know what I say what

968
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:19,759
I mean when I say this so if you think

969
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,079
about the piece of pie and you cut it

970
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:22,969
and you know there are eight people in

971
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:25,779
the room and they all get a slice if

972
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:27,949
that guy takes two then you know

973
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:29,809
somebody's not getting pie or what if

974
00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:32,959
two more people come in well we're out

975
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:36,829
of pie no no there's just enough pie so

976
00:43:32,959 --> 00:43:38,569
jobs opportunities for everyone remember

977
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:43,069
that number three and a half million

978
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:45,079
unfilled positions in the next year stop

979
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:49,308
thinking about other people's successes

980
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:52,189
as your failures like other people can

981
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:55,789
be successful too you can be successful

982
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:58,038
we can all be successful if a person at

983
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:59,569
your work achieves a level of success it

984
00:43:58,039 --> 00:44:02,809
doesn't mean that there's not a place

985
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:06,499
for you to like find your way or let

986
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:09,400
your light shine right so be happy for

987
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:14,178
your colleagues and I know that that's

988
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:17,119
not always easy right but it's it's a

989
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:19,789
you're gonna live a happier life if you

990
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,910
can find a way to one stop taking

991
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:25,609
everything so personally and to like

992
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,109
enjoy the success of others and then

993
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,930
that will come

994
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:30,220
back to you it's not like hippie dippie

995
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:32,890
stuff like it's a real thing

996
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,288
silos are garbage how do you think I

997
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,058
feel about silos it's pretty clear on

998
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:42,099
this one so what do I mean by that

999
00:44:37,059 --> 00:44:46,269
though how many security people in the

1000
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:50,680
room are stupid frustrated with their IT

1001
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:53,038
team liars everyone without their hand

1002
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,629
raised liars

1003
00:44:53,039 --> 00:45:03,430
how many security folks are frustrated

1004
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:06,609
with engineers so how many security

1005
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:08,069
folks find that infrastructure is there

1006
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:10,480
blocker

1007
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:12,538
right except some infrastructure but

1008
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,029
yeah I'm my own blocker a lot of times

1009
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:18,460
so when I talk about tearing down silos

1010
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:20,859
I I think and this is just a little bit

1011
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,230
of a take away if you can get away from

1012
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:25,779
that idea again and this us versus them

1013
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:29,680
and realize that you all have the same

1014
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:32,829
goal right to build a secure thing it's

1015
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,279
just that some people's task is securing

1016
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:38,140
the user some folks tasks are securing

1017
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:41,099
the infrastructure some folks have to

1018
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:43,420
focus on writing secure code or

1019
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:46,029
rewriting code once the security team

1020
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:49,599
tells them their codes not secure those

1021
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:52,869
conversations are hard to have but if

1022
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,059
you can think of all of that as a we

1023
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:57,549
instead of like a security versus

1024
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:59,980
everyone else and you should build a

1025
00:45:57,549 --> 00:46:03,279
better thing you don't I mean just try

1026
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:06,660
it once and you'll see maybe if you

1027
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:10,749
plant a security person in your first

1028
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:12,308
sprint with the engineers you'll find

1029
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:14,618
that you get a very different outcome

1030
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:16,690
than if you try to deal with the

1031
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:18,549
security piece once the Sprint's over

1032
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:22,390
and the things built in you're you're

1033
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:24,130
ready to go to testing right you can

1034
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,348
save yourself some time all that baked

1035
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:28,989
insecurity who knows the word to term

1036
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:30,640
well now you do baked insecurity so it's

1037
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:33,220
like the idea that from the beginning

1038
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,578
you're working together to just build

1039
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:41,250
the best thing and

1040
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:42,990
stop fighting oh my god I considered a

1041
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:47,069
challenge before the whole human race

1042
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:54,598
secured all the things I swear please

1043
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:57,829
yes Queen your prize is that you're now

1044
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,829
my favorite okay

1045
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:03,390
1977 all right so I'm gonna throw some

1046
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,099
final thoughts at you

1047
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:10,078
security is a journey not a destination

1048
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,180
Bob I think touched on this a little bit

1049
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,960
yesterday like with his security as a

1050
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:18,750
feeling but raise your hand if the thing

1051
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:21,930
that you work on is 100% secure and

1052
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,380
unhackable but raise your hand if you

1053
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:28,169
feel pretty good about it

1054
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:31,640
okay you know that's the best we can do

1055
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:35,190
right don't hoard knowledge that's weird

1056
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:38,040
folks that's just weird hey can you show

1057
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:42,660
me how you like pivoted to this server

1058
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:45,210
from you know that exploit know what

1059
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,020
okay that person is never gonna ask you

1060
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:49,230
another question

1061
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,329
how about yeah let me write this report

1062
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,000
that's gonna take 12 times longer than

1063
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:55,260
it took me to pop the box and then we

1064
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,869
can sit down and I'll show you what I

1065
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:03,300
did right like just try to share

1066
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:05,190
knowledge yeah so it's it's like my

1067
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,599
little mantra but we are all in this

1068
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,760
together if we're gonna do this and

1069
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:12,390
we're gonna do it right we have to start

1070
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:17,220
thinking as a team as a collective as an

1071
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:17,868
us as a we we're gonna fail take a

1072
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:20,279
vacation

1073
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:27,510
please taking a vacation within the last

1074
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:29,520
six months look at that see Europe very

1075
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,530
different in the United States you

1076
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,369
probably get like mandatory vacations

1077
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:36,569
here don't you I would flip you off but

1078
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:37,530
it's a keynote and I probably shouldn't

1079
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:41,550
do that

1080
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:43,840
be kind right like if you take nothing

1081
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:48,610
else away from this today

1082
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:51,970
just be kind like what does it hurt it

1083
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:55,390
you know when you carry around this like

1084
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:57,819
animosity and like hirings broken we

1085
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,170
can't fix the pipeline not enough women

1086
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,930
are applying we need to check a

1087
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,850
diversity box we need to fix all these

1088
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:10,480
things and you keep thinking of it in

1089
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:13,480
this like very stressful way you're kind

1090
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,700
of unable to be kind you're not able to

1091
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,950
really like be your best self

1092
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,960
but if we can think about things like

1093
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,600
hey how can I be more thoughtful with my

1094
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,510
job descriptions how can I sell my brand

1095
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:29,279
in a way that lets folks know I care

1096
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:32,350
about values and culture if I can

1097
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,820
encourage folks in interviews by by

1098
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,450
letting them know we're gonna have some

1099
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:39,100
professional development opportunities a

1100
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:41,200
lot of those other problems we're trying

1101
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:48,130
to solve with like diversity inclusion

1102
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:51,000
and bringing folks from marginalized

1103
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:53,800
communities into the tech world those

1104
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,770
problems kind of work themselves out

1105
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,540
because we've addressed some of the

1106
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:03,910
things that are choking the pipeline

1107
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:07,000
very early on in the process so we're

1108
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:10,270
almost out of time I could take like two

1109
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,760
questions maybe until they yell at me or

1110
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:15,400
jog me off with a number I just know

1111
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,590
anyone have any questions it's cuz you

1112
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,900
you're smarter than people in the ass is

1113
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:22,980
that what you're saying no I get you

1114
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:26,890
fine then here's what you get oops sorry

1115
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,250
we're out of time so this is all the

1116
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:31,390
back Doc's this is all about me my

1117
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,690
twitter handles them is back

1118
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:36,100
not-safe-for-work Kimber I trust that

1119
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,950
works if you want to shoot me an email

1120

or you know if you're interested I mean

1121
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:46,149
a secure infrastructure on AWS call me

1122
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:50,190
up but this mock interview and resume

1123
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:54,790
workshop repo lives at Starbucks calm

1124
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:56,170
and that's where you'll find the repo if

1125
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:57,550
you want to contribute if you have a

1126
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:59,140
community project that you

1127
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:01,360
working on that partners mentors and

1128
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,190
mentees feel free to contribute to the

1129
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:06,100
repo like let's build it up it's a

1130
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:08,770
community effort I just happen to own it

1131
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,839
or maintain it but everyone's welcome to

1132
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,270
take it back to their communities if

1133
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:15,250
you're her PyCon has used the framework

1134
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,390
at their conference a lot of b-sides in

1135
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,830
the united states have used them and

1136
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,770
i've gone to a few conferences and run

1137
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:23,890
them when they workshop myself and then

1138
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:27,220
