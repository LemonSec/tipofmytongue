1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,070
thank you very much

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:13,910
this talk is a hacker's view two eyes

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,779
OSA e21 four three four and even though

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:20,690
the title is rather complex and sounds

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:24,350
like organizational security I'm trying

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:26,780
to get the picture on where we are

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:31,220
regarding automotive security and what

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,250
will happen in the next few years so I'm

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:37,640
Martin I'm on Twitter during the day I

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,700
work for the automotive industry but

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:45,200
from the supplier point of view by night

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:48,680
I do digital forensics and work on

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,710
applied privacy schemes so privacy is

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:57,559
kind of my thing in between I have a

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:01:00,020
very old car so this car is my

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,530
experience and automotive hacking mostly

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:06,170
but it's built in the 80s so all the

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,179
fancy parts which we have now in modern

19
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,569
cars are not included

20
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:15,020
not even closely so everything here

21
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:17,420
which is electric is basically electric

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,340
there's no buses to communicate there's

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,560
no e call no airbags not even seat belts

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,789
so usual disclaimer this is me not my

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,029
employer also I have the bird's eye view

26
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:35,029
on the documents but not the process so

27
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:38,630
I'm not actively involved in the process

28
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:41,869
to this standardization there are plenty

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,719
of people in the standardization process

30
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:47,630
involved so they might have a different

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:51,740
take on why specific elements are part

32
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:56,419
of the standard and some are not however

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:59,869
I think the the current draft of this

34
00:01:56,419 --> 00:02:02,419
standard is in a state which is somewhat

35
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,520
presentable and this is why I'm here

36
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:05,779
because I think it's kind of an

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,750
important topic and I'd like to

38
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:10,340
encourage everyone to actually look into

39
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,160
automotive security because it's

40
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,860
actually fascinating itself

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,079
so all started for me at least back in

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,410
2015 when Charlie Miller and Chris

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,050
valasek they hacked the Jeep they hacked

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,070
the entertainment system remotely over

45
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,740
the Internet

46
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,040
and were able to send Khan messages this

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,750
was kind of like the super gal for the

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,810
automotive industry in the fall out they

49
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:42,450
had to recall 1.4 million cars into the

50
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,240
workshops which is among the most

51
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,780
expensive things you can have as a car

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,450
manufacturer and of course people lose

53
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:55,320
trust into your brand of cars and the

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,880
implications are numerous and that did a

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:03,180
pretty damaging impact an interesting

56
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,040
thing about the fixes so once they had

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,200
the black hat talk and this video came

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:13,769
online they they showed how they hacked

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,890
those jeeps and one of the things which

60
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,370
let them to connect these cars over the

61
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,519
Internet

62
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,920
were open ports which are reachable over

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,959
the mobile network so the car had a SIM

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,799
card in it it was used for connectivity

65
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,870
features pretty usual but the network

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,310
was not separated from the regular

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,950
network so everyone within the mobile a

68
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,830
mobile provider could find these devices

69
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:47,310
and basically this is what exactly what

70
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:50,250
they did yeah and also interesting the

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,410
quickest fix for these issues were that

72
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,420
the service provider they dropped

73
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,570
forwarding those packets and this is

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,570
like one I pee table role this was

75
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,730
conducted within hours so the ISP the

76
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,820
network operator cooperated in a way

77
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,869
that this issue was fixed within hours

78
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,150
and just in the fallout afterwards

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,730
these devices were called into the

80
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,519
workshops they have been patched some of

81
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,488
them were patched remotely and yeah it's

82
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,990
an interesting story how this all turns

83
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:27,138
out so this is second quite popular hack

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,710
it's a so-called relay

85
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,120
attack against keyless entry system so

86
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,159
usually when you have a keyless entry

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,949
system and I have one myself it's really

88
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:39,560
convenient when you come home you drop

89
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:42,439
the key next to the entrance and this

90
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,180
was caught on video how the thieves in

91
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,580
that particular case stole the car they

92
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:50,389
had two devices they extended the range

93
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:53,659
of the overall keyless system got into

94
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,719
the car drove away and we're out of the

95
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:58,248
country probably within hours

96
00:04:55,719 --> 00:05:00,949
interesting thing here is that if the

97
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:03,409
key is no longer present in the car the

98
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,960
user gets an indication saying hey you

99
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:07,849
maybe forgot your key if you turn off

100
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,680
the engine you will not be able to start

101
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:12,199
it again but the engine is allowed to

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,610
run and it runs and runs it runs as long

103
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:18,740
as you do not turn it off last year

104
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,289
there was another black hat talk and was

105
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,979
by Keane Labs again they do amazing

106
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:28,998
research in vulnerability identification

107
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:32,599
and they hacked BMWs expensive ones they

108
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:35,180
do pretty pretty good stuff on the Left

109
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:39,438
there's the list of the C V's and so

110
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:44,569
forth but yeah hacking cars is common

111
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:48,560
and yeah it actually works remotely over

112
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:49,810
Wi-Fi or over wireless networks which is

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,389
kind of scary

114
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,300
so the overall motivation for this talk

115
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:58,399
is that vehicles are complex if you buy

116
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,830
a modern car you have about 100

117
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,250
microcontrollers in there they control

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,878
and configure everything that you move

119
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,649
in the car or that can be moved from

120
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,529
lights to airbags to brakes to the

121
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:14,689
engine everything is tightly coupled

122
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:16,759
they're highly intervened they need to

123
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:19,819
communicate with each other using

124
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,240
various protocols and often they have

125
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:26,240
real-time requirements meaning that if

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,270
some sensor detects a crash you really

127
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,310
want the airbag to detonate within

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,710
milliseconds or microseconds even to

129
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,430
prevent the passengers from actually

130
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,008
hitting the car

131
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,900
however security not a priority - so far

132
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:42,910
so history

133
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:46,299
bound to repeat itself we had same

134
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,820
issues for I don't know 30 40 years ago

135
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,370
when the public internet was invented

136
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,650
security hasn't been an issue look where

137
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,050
we are now it would be great if we

138
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,229
wouldn't have to repeat all the errors

139
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,400
with it back then but we're on the best

140
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:06,789
way to actually do that so this is the

141
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:11,080
the network map of a modern car it's

142
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:15,280
from a paper which took a Skoda some car

143
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:19,270
modern car 2017 model and they mapped

144
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,599
all the different ECU's and components

145
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,000
which are part of the actual car so

146
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,479
usually at top you have the OBD port

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,699
this is mandated by California and

148
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,219
us-based laws that you have to have this

149
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,440
diagnostic port you have then the

150
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,229
Gateway module which more or less

151
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,169
separates the different networks this

152
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:44,110
separation is not due to security

153
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,389
reasons would be great but actually it's

154
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,440
for bandwidth reasons so you couldn't

155
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:53,250
put every ECU on the same bus simply

156
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,810
because the bandwidth is much too small

157
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:00,130
and you can see you have different buses

158
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,930
you have chassis cars chassis bus you

159
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,510
have a comfort bus somewhere is the

160
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,210
infotainment system and they can

161
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,020
communicate with all the other buses

162
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,630
happily Everafter

163
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,210
over the Gateway and if the Gateway is

164
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,479
not built to actually fill the frames

165
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,609
and messages sent between those

166
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,880
different buses then this is just one

167
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:26,740
gigantic possible Broadcasting Network

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,889
another problem is that software updates

169
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:33,130
for cars are not a thing yet so we have

170
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:35,560
software updates for plenty of devices

171
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,740
ranging from our smartphones to

172
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:42,809
operating systems whatever you name it

173
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,390
and updating software and cars is still

174
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:49,359
stigmatized so every car vendor would

175
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:51,490
love to have the capability to actually

176
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,040
push updates over the Internet no works

177
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,640
have involved having them signed and

178
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,860
have them

179
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,680
transported securely but this is not yet

180
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:05,110
happening weakest part are often the

181
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,880
customer so I as a customer buy a brand

182
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,310
new car I have no say in the

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,350
architecture or the software update

184
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,829
policy I have no idea how long I will

185
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,830
receive software updates if there are

186
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:21,270
software updates planned so I'm the one

187
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,220
left in the dark more or less

188
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:27,910
interestingly for car manufacturers

189
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:31,870
money is a great incentive so they do

190
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,689
build the cars as secure as they need to

191
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:37,270
be and as they some even go further and

192
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,360
they derive fascinating architectures on

193
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:44,199
how to secure communication common fear

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,010
however is for wonder on the liability

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,020
in the US law meaning that if you toast

196
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:55,600
your hamster you can be liable as a

197
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,840
manufacturer of a toaster and insurance

198
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,410
cost so if there is a specific car which

199
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:05,410
is particularly easy to steal then the

200
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,390
insurance prices for that car will go up

201
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:11,170
and the car manufacturer will sell

202
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:14,949
actually less cars of that model so this

203
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:18,130
is kind of the the balancing act between

204
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:21,100
a car manufacturer the customer and the

205
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:28,090
rest of the world trying to be safe from

206
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:30,490
that actual threat so some background in

207
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,000
a car we have the so called can bus it's

208
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,820
a rather robust communication channel

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,610
which works very well has been invented

210
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:42,010
other than I don't know 30 years ago and

211
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,950
is a real-time protocol allowing

212
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,260
communication between different

213
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,510
components bandwidth is low you have

214
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,710
about a megabit tops usually you have

215
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,530
250 or 500 kilobit the payload is very

216
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,980
small you have 64 bits of payload per

217
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,750
frame meaning that if you want to add

218
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,550
encryption or authentication to that

219
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,730
this is really really challenging

220
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:11,269
because you have 64 bits of data

221
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:14,660
and you have to actually split the this

222
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:16,730
area one part for the data you want to

223
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,618
send a data part for a signature and I

224
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,609
don't know that many signature themes

225
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:25,639
schemes but 64 bit tops capacities

226
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:29,359
sounds like a real challenge to me and

227
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,069
of course no security built in there so

228
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,779
the only security in there is that you

229
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:35,540
have arbitration so if two different

230
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,160
components are talking at the same time

231
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,368
the one with the higher priority

232
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,019
assigned will win so you have

233
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:46,009
prioritized signals that can go back and

234
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:48,980
forth and yeah in essence this is the

235
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:52,879
holy grail for automotive hacking if you

236
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:56,359
can send raw conference it's just the

237
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,999
same as if you got rude on the Box it's

238
00:11:56,359 --> 00:12:03,730
basically that put everything everyone

239
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:06,679
is trying to achieve the attack surface

240
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:11,389
arranged from top to bottom is also

241
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:13,399
quite large you have physical attack

242
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:16,369
surface meaning that people will try to

243
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,139
take out the chips and the control units

244
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:21,949
try to reflash it with different

245
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:24,859
firmware and most commonly this is used

246
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,899
for chip tuning so you have the car you

247
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:30,379
flash the different software and all of

248
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:33,139
a sudden you get 20 horsepower more of

249
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:36,399
course this is not allowed and shouldn't

250
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:40,569
be done but this is the the most basic

251
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:43,160
physical attack against the car there is

252
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:44,868
then you have the wireless protocols

253
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,769
every modern car is equipped with a

254
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:49,999
multitude of wireless communication

255
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,549
capabilities you have wireless key fobs

256
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:55,549
which allow you to approach the car and

257
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:57,980
enter it without actually doing anything

258
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,730
you just have the key in the pocket and

259
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,970
it works

260
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,850
tire pressure sensors so back in 2010

261
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:07,369
there was a neat attack against the tire

262
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,759
pressure sensor because they were not

263
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:14,839
communicated communicating securely and

264
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:17,029
using a radio which you could program

265
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,639
you could send more or less con frames

266
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,470
by manipulating the tire pressure values

267
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,290
you have the infotainment

268
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,150
system so all the big breaches not the

269
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,839
breaches but the big hacks in recent

270
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,670
years where cars have been hacked most

271
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,940
of them used the infotainment system

272
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,160
there was a poem to own last this year

273
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:42,650
and they Tesla participated and they

274
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,750
whoever hacked the car did it via the

275
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:49,160
unpatched browser and the infant nment

276
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,290
system yeah if you're getting physical

277
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,439
there's always an obd2 port in the car

278
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,540
it's a standardized connector you can

279
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,880
connect to it and then talk directly

280
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,770
with the car this is what every workshop

281
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,570
tool does to actually read out the error

282
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:08,380
messages to get an information on the

283
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,850
state of the car and so forth and

284
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,189
increasingly their back ends so every

285
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,620
car is connected it talks via public

286
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,860
network private network whatever to some

287
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,660
back-end it sends some data there are

288
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,280
API is available to act

289
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,189
I don't know start the heater in your

290
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:30,050
car remotely and this is also part of

291
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:33,860
the attack surface of course some

292
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:36,380
interfaces it's not only limited to con

293
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,180
you have a multitude of wired and

294
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,430
wireless protocols that the car is able

295
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,790
to speak you have flex rate most Lin

296
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:47,359
those are bus based systems to exchange

297
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,219
data at a higher data rate you have

298
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,350
automotive Ethernet which is not the

299
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,420
standard Ethernet that we put into our

300
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,920
walls to connect our devices but it's a

301
00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:01,010
twisted pair Gigabit Ethernet still its

302
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,360
Ethernet so all the tools and the

303
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:08,270
different parts of the available

304
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,150
literature should work you have wireless

305
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,530
in the different spectrums which are

306
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:18,319
openly available used for key fobs or

307
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,610
whatever and of course convenience you

308
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,350
have NFC Wi-Fi Bluetooth if you have a

309
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:25,220
phone book which will be synchronized

310
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,270
with the car

311
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,940
of course that's a an attack vector as

312
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,250
well most of these things have no

313
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,089
security specified they're just built to

314
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,800
work with Anik

315
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:40,249
and in the challenging environment of a

316
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,969
modern vehicle most of them have no

317
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:45,999
security or it's optional so Bluetooth

318
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:48,949
we should all know can be made secure

319
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:51,379
but it has to be configured properly and

320
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,139
to actually be encrypted and

321
00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:56,389
authenticated and without anyone being

322
00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:02,149
able to do a man-in-the-middle attack

323
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:04,759
for example then we have gsm LTE this is

324
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:06,829
in europe mandatory so if you buy a new

325
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,769
car today this is mandatory to have the

326
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:13,099
e call feature if the airbag detonates

327
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:15,290
into your face it will automatically do

328
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,139
the call for help

329
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,019
usually this interface is only activated

330
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:22,670
when the airbag detonates so you don't

331
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:26,089
have the always-on connection which is

332
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,430
trackable body service provider but

333
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:30,529
still it's men that they mandated by law

334
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,959
that you have to have a SIM card in your

335
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,959
car which is able to actually do the e

336
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,899
call and you not only have one you have

337
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,599
multiple SIM cards so these things are

338
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:44,059
connected some of them are able to speak

339
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,439
GSM so you could do MC capture deployed

340
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:50,990
with a u.s. RP next to the car and try

341
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:54,529
to actually communicate with the car

342
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:57,410
over this communication channel and of

343
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,850
course there's vehicle to a vehicle to

344
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,269
vehicle communication vehicle to

345
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:05,419
infrastructure vehicle to whatever this

346
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:07,609
is currently being developed these are

347
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,610
protocols which we'll see in the next

348
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:13,279
five years they have security to some

349
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:16,569
extent built in there we will see which

350
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,010
of those protocols will prevail but

351
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,720
currently there are two protocols which

352
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,329
are discussed one is based on LTE

353
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,480
technology the other one is based on

354
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,658
Wi-Fi so they are built to communicate

355
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,360
the information that there is a car the

356
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:35,679
direction the speed anything you can

357
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:39,879
imagine could be transported to nearby

358
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,880
receivers in the future

359
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:48,330
but best security measures so far and

360
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:51,030
this is the the one of the things which

361
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,159
actually makes automotive hacking very

362
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,139
expensive if you want to hack an

363
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,500
expensive car you have to have access to

364
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,539
an expensive car and if you look at how

365
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,910
you have to dismantle all the different

366
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:05,250
body components to get access to the

367
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,870
different issues this is nothing which

368
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,090
will happen over the not over the night

369
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:11,370
or at the weekend so you cannot do it

370
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,949
with a rental car but you have to have

371
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:17,610
access to that and most people don't do

372
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:19,350
that for money but for fun so you need

373
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:24,928
to have access to a car which you can

374
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:26,610
then actually do your hacking on so this

375
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,010
is pretty dark pictures so we have

376
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:33,360
plenty of proprietary technology

377
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:34,860
protocols we have low accessibility for

378
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,449
people to actually look into these

379
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,309
things which doesn't look so good from a

380
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,049
hacker's point of view so we have

381
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:44,610
challenges in getting access to those

382
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,549
things we have the problem of getting

383
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:50,610
the information that would be needed

384
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:53,129
from a public point point of view to

385
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:56,129
actually look into the things and have

386
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,350
been implemented this is not a good

387
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:02,360
thing this is but this is the the way it

388
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:05,879
is right now there's not much we can do

389
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:10,439
so this brings me to the ISO part of the

390
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:15,179
talk there is currently a ISO standard

391
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:19,080
being drafted to actually improve the

392
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:22,799
security of cars and entire cars as well

393
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,289
as components so currently this is a

394
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,210
committee draft I don't know when it

395
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,879
started it's already probably three

396
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:34,500
years back when standardisation of this

397
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,909
process began but right now the draft is

398
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,350
about 120 pages some of them are only

399
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:43,110
informative so they have annexes they

400
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:47,399
have examples describing the different

401
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:50,729
steps on how to actually secure a car

402
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,890
it's internationally collaborated so

403
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,120
manufacturers are included as well as

404
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,670
suppliers

405
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,790
the general public is missing I will

406
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,980
come to that in the second and sometime

407
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:06,800
next year it's expected to be released

408
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:10,280
so the ISO standard procedure says that

409
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:15,600
right now we're in the community draft

410
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:18,090
phase and once there is a more or less

411
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,110
public draft available then the members

412
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,560
will vote on accepting or not accepting

413
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:30,860
this as an international standard and

414
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,860
this is going to happen sometime in 2020

415
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,710
so some fun facts when my background is

416
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:42,810
in IT so I studied computer science in

417
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,640
the automotive world the v-model

418
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,710
development process is still a thing

419
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,230
which is a good thing because you have

420
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,930
complex things and agile is not built to

421
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,970
suit for any case however when I first

422
00:20:51,930 --> 00:21:00,570
discovered this I was like what is this

423
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:03,920
so the model development still works in

424
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:06,929
the entire draft you have 822

425
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,860
occurrences of the word cybersecurity so

426
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:12,390
cyber is king you have one time cyber

427
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,969
security with a - so they're

428
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:19,350
inconsistent and you have plenty of

429
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,030
risks agile only ones so what is the

430
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,179
draft all about

431
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,850
in essence it's risk management so it

432
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,370
takes the entire picture of how a

433
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,189
component or how a vehicle will be used

434
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,520
and tries to identify and then mitigate

435
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:41,070
the risks that can be applied against

436
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:44,160
this component or car so beat a

437
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:47,129
component or be the entire car the the

438
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:51,000
goal is to identify the risks and make

439
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,460
this thing secure with everything that

440
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,650
comes with it so not just the

441
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,590
development process but also the

442
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,530
operations and decommissioning which is

443
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,480
a pretty good thing it also can include

444
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,120
vulnerability management meaning that

445
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,130
any manufacturer any OEM which is

446
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,000
actually

447
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,190
committing themselves to this ISO

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,010
standard to be they have to have a

449
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,740
process in place to if there is a

450
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,500
vulnerability identified then they need

451
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,600
to be able to actually work on that they

452
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,600
need to process it they need to provide

453
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:34,370
updates and and this is a core component

454
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:37,889
of the entire standard it is based on

455
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:40,110
two things one is the functional safety

456
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,760
stand standard which is a big thing in

457
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,560
the automotive industry so there's

458
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,140
always the confusion between safety and

459
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,210
security safety is built around that the

460
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,410
thing you're looking at is not able to

461
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:54,870
kill you and security is always about

462
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:57,900
that someone else could use this thing

463
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,409
against you to kill you so well

464
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,420
safety is four things against humans and

465
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,730
Security's

466
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:10,620
four things against different set of

467
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:15,510
humans there's also a internet the sa

468
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:19,139
sae standard the security guidebook for

469
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:21,990
cyber physical vehicle systems this has

470
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,700
been published beginning of 2016 and

471
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,310
this was interesting because this came

472
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,540
out shortly after the like half a year

473
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:33,240
after the cheap hacks and it already

474
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,580
includes a multitude of steps to

475
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,450
actually secure things during

476
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,669
development it doesn't speak much about

477
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:45,150
the usage of the product and how it can

478
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,770
be made secure during runtime but it

479
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,050
includes a lot of steps during the

480
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:54,750
development process which is kind of

481
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:57,480
impressive also relevant easel 31,000

482
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,180
ish that's the standard risk management

483
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,260
thing without reading the draft this is

484
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:07,620
just common sense if you have a risk you

485
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,680
can identify the severity of manifesting

486
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:12,449
that risk with the likelihood of this

487
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:15,120
thing to happen so this is what we do

488
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:16,620
every time we cross the street or we

489
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,770
browse a website or we click an

490
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,209
attachment on an email that's always how

491
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:25,440
likely is it that this is

492
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:30,510
going to be bad versus what's the impact

493
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:34,380
and what will happen if I do also in

494
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,658
2016 d8 nhtsa the national highway

495
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,289
Transplant Security Agency in the u.s.

496
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:45,390
they published a best practice booklet

497
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:48,629
on cyber cyber security in cars also

498
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:53,010
shortly after the hacks this is also

499
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:56,640
pretty complete in a sense that it came

500
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,620
at the right time and did good however

501
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,140
it wasn't mandatory it can be audited

502
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:04,799
and so forth automotive industry is a

503
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,340
bit slow so everyone knew that it was

504
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,320
there

505
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:16,049
but many didn't simply care also quite

506
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:19,168
recently the UN body for economic they

507
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:22,049
drafted a standard for security in cars

508
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:24,390
as well as over-the-air updates this is

509
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,520
impressive because usually if the UN

510
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,730
comes in and draft something like this

511
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:33,210
it means that all the others are late

512
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,820
for the party and in 2018 there was a

513
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:39,120
California IOT security law published

514
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:41,639
which is basically for everything which

515
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,699
has an internet connection and is small

516
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,260
enough to steal it more or less which

517
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,750
could also mean that this applies to

518
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,570
cars because they have an internet

519
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:55,679
connection and they use it for all kinds

520
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:58,470
of different things one of the early

521
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,809
documents was kind of interesting

522
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,230
because it recommended using an

523
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:06,510
intrusion detection system in a car and

524
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,840
imagine you have this complex Beast of

525
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,549
networks distributed systems and then

526
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,320
someone tries hey wouldn't it be great

527
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,350
idea to actually do intrusion detection

528
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,740
on those signals and everybody's like

529
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:22,500
yes it could work we don't even get it

530
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,899
right on the internet not sure what to

531
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:28,140
look for how do you do the baselines and

532
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:32,149
so forth so this made quite some

533
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,260
confusing looks from my side as least

534
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:37,800
yes you have a

535
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,410
physically bounded thing that moves but

536
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,800
just doing intrusion detection on the

537
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:49,610
signals that are transmitted seemed a

538
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:52,560
bit far-fetched to me so what's in the

539
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:56,399
standard itself this is standard risk

540
00:26:52,560 --> 00:27:00,419
management this is happening both for IT

541
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,480
systems as well as humans every day of

542
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,850
their lives you identify the assets what

543
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,520
is important to you you identify

544
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,840
possible vulnerabilities and then you

545
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,670
get resulting threats the risk value is

546
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,199
impact of the threat to manifest itself

547
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:21,900
times the feasibility and around these

548
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,980
list of risks you can then sort this

549
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:29,220
list and then start mitigating them

550
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,440
accordingly to the risk value also

551
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,010
security goals you want confidentiality

552
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,900
integrity availability was also for

553
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,960
vehicles interest is freshness and

554
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:44,910
authenticity of course you do not want

555
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:48,330
the wiper control to actually ignite the

556
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:53,370
air packs so you have authenticity in

557
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:55,530
there as well some basic examples you

558
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,449
have the acid the acid for example could

559
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,389
be the engine control unit which

560
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:03,980
actually controls the engine every part

561
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:08,430
about it for against and protected

562
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:10,280
against chip tuning goal is to preserve

563
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,840
the integrity of the software in their

564
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,430
impact could be severe so if anybody

565
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,860
modifies the software of the engine

566
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,600
control unit this could have severe

567
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,030
consequences while you're driving for

568
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,860
example engine shutting down to to a

569
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,290
narrow state this is not something you

570
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:29,040
would like to have and feasibility is

571
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:32,030
high because chip tuning is a thing and

572
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:34,409
you can buy tools of available online

573
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,600
outcome of this risk estimation is a

574
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,090
better do something about it protect the

575
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,649
integrity of the software running in

576
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,620
there and this is actually happening so

577
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,590
you have integrity protecting mechanisms

578
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,699
like secure boot authenticated boot

579
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,889
signed software updates

580
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,110
to actually prevent someone from

581
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:56,150
modifying the software of that

582
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:59,010
particular component if you take another

583
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,810
example you have the infotainment system

584
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,870
the thing which actually plays the

585
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:06,690
sounds of the radio or whatever it is

586
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:10,199
you're listening to goal is availability

587
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:12,450
so customers will be rather fed up if

588
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,750
the radio is not working or if they

589
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:20,550
cannot couple their smartphone with the

590
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:23,550
car to listen to their music so goal is

591
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:27,240
availability impact if that doesn't work

592
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:29,159
is rather low it's frustrating for

593
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,190
customers but at least you can die of

594
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,140
that and feasibility is high outcome

595
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,050
could be okay but it's probably not

596
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:41,040
depending on the particular

597
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:43,110
circumstances so this is happening for

598
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,850
every component for every vehicle

599
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,610
according to the draft prior to

600
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,919
development so before you actually start

601
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,929
implementing stuff you identify okay

602
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,900
what are the risks what are the threats

603
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:57,890
and how can I mitigate them to prevent

604
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,690
those threats to manifest themselves

605
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,630
next step then is to develop a security

606
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:07,820
concept to actually mitigate those risks

607
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:11,070
so you specifying that okay to prevent

608
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:13,200
modification of software or inspection

609
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:16,800
of communication channels you actually

610
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,540
encrypt them you put these things into

611
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:23,820
the requirements and they will then be

612
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,920
implemented these can be requirements

613
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,320
saying you need to encrypt every

614
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,060
communication with the public internet

615
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:37,740
end-to-end and you have to authenticate

616
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:40,379
it and so forth can be also not strict

617
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,030
could be organizational measures so

618
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,710
proper training of developers for

619
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,930
example could be a requirement to be

620
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,960
fulfilled that people should know okay

621
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:53,190
you're using C C is a known language to

622
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,380
be not memory

623
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,570
not good regarding security with memory

624
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:05,890
management so you would like to have

625
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:08,080
your developers trained trained the

626
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,299
standard then describes you develop your

627
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,600
software you verify that actually the

628
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,950
thing you built is according to the

629
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,370
expectation you have and then you

630
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,980
validate the entire concept for example

631
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:25,479
using a penetration test this is

632
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:28,320
interesting because if you apply or if

633
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,149
you want to follow this standard

634
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,039
eventually this will mean you have to

635
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:35,610
have someone externally of the

636
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,059
development process to actually verify

637
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:43,600
that the things you did are sane and the

638
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:47,230
product is not able to be in the

639
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,149
headlines this could be for one a

640
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,809
penetration test this could be also an

641
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:57,279
audit to check the security organization

642
00:31:52,809 --> 00:32:00,309
on and so forth the good thing is it

643
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:05,220
doesn't end here because once the car is

644
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:09,210
in the field it is still a valid attack

645
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:12,190
it still has a valid attack surface so

646
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,320
the good thing about this particular iso

647
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,450
standard is that it doesn't take the

648
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,450
development process into scope but the

649
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,789
entire lifetime of that thing which is

650
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,340
great because usually it was you sell it

651
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:29,049
it's out there you're done as a

652
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:32,559
manufacturer but now the responsibility

653
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:37,590
lies even further until the end of life

654
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,730
of that particular car or component

655
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,980
meaning that once development is

656
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:45,309
complete you should have a list of the

657
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,799
residual risks specifying okay this

658
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:50,168
could happen but it's too funky to

659
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:54,809
actually mitigate it or impact is too

660
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:57,909
low to actually do something about this

661
00:32:54,809 --> 00:33:00,399
these residual risks are not static so

662
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,860
every time a new attack arrives by some

663
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,658
conference presentation the first thing

664
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,649
you can do is take the list of residual

665
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:08,020
risk

666
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,210
you ate them if one of those risks gets

667
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:14,620
more likely or impact gets more severe

668
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:17,470
to redo the analysis step and then again

669
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,379
triage figure out what is it and how

670
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:24,450
does it work it also includes aspects

671
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:28,810
for production security some aspects of

672
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,980
production are rather interesting to say

673
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:34,899
it like that

674
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:37,500
having key management is useful if you

675
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,910
have individual cryptographic keys in

676
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,470
different components you really would

677
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,090
like to have some key management you

678
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,130
would like to track the serial number

679
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,800
with the key you need to know who is in

680
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:50,650
possession of the key and so forth and

681
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,230
also production is usually another one

682
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:56,710
shot so once a car is made it's made for

683
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:59,590
five six ten years then it's refurbished

684
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:02,830
or upgraded but the entire process is

685
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:06,330
not done by simply say great we're going

686
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:08,830
to production thanks for everything

687
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:11,649
it then goes even further

688
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,569
once the thing is in the field you have

689
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:17,909
the operations and the maintenance phase

690
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:21,909
where actually incidents can happen so

691
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:25,659
you as the producer have to monitor you

692
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:28,030
have to triage for incidents and then to

693
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,940
proper Incident Response so figuring out

694
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,480
okay how did this attack okay did you

695
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:38,470
can you verify that it actually is valid

696
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,800
and then to incident response in the end

697
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:46,389
of the day it boils down to update so

698
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,909
once some issue is identified that needs

699
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,759
an update there has to be a process in

700
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:54,190
place to actually to updates

701
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,649
it also trickles down the supply chain

702
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:01,300
so if you're just as a manufacturer

703
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:05,230
getting components you will likely need

704
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:08,050
your supplier to be able to ship updates

705
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:11,410
and so forth so this is our current

706
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,300
position at least my that we are part of

707
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:16,390
the supply chain we have suppliers

708
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,020
ourselves and now the responsibilities

709
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:21,290
trickle down to two

710
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:24,910
the last end of the supply chain like

711
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:28,460
the chip makers or the manufacturers

712
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,950
which are contracted this will be

713
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:33,200
interesting and in the end you have at

714
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,230
the Commission phase so once this thing

715
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,618
is no longer expected to be alive it can

716
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:45,470
be killed and then responsibilities

717
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:48,470
regarding security ends that's it so

718
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:52,009
what's my take on this basically I think

719
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:56,410
it's a great approach it to make this an

720
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:59,360
international standard cars are rolling

721
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,180
distributed system with attack surface

722
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:06,650
as large as the butt of an elephant

723
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:10,399
more or less so cars are currently a

724
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:13,790
challenge to secure them properly one

725
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,820
thing on the standardization process ISO

726
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,490
has a business model of actually selling

727
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,619
those standards so they are not keen on

728
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:24,799
open development of these standards

729
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:30,470
which is in my particular view not a

730
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:33,080
great thing to have so standard this

731
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,569
asian process is closed and E's have to

732
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:38,000
be signed every time I talk to someone

733
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:39,830
if I can get a copy of the current draft

734
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,290
for example then I have you signed the

735
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:46,970
NDA yes of course of scientist

736
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:52,009
however it's 2019 soon to 2020

737
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:53,930
I really thought we are over this the

738
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:58,190
quote Kenny Patterson Kenny Patterson is

739
00:36:53,930 --> 00:37:01,009
my hero in back in the standardization

740
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:06,710
of TLS 1.3 there was a discussion about

741
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,890
RSA's RSA key transport someone from the

742
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:13,100
banking industry came and said hey we

743
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:15,379
thought we could keep RSA key exchange

744
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,980
alive because we needed were need to

745
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:20,750
comply with the laws and Kenny Patterson

746
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,230
then responded you're a bit late to the

747
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,619
party

748
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,420
further down he said I know the banking

749
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,380
industry is usually a bit slow but this

750
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:32,529
takes the biscuit with the

751
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:36,309
UK dryness of humor

752
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:40,359
so I would really like to see more

753
00:37:36,309 --> 00:37:42,910
openness in developing such standards

754
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:46,209
because it could make sense to include a

755
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,589
broader range and in the end someone

756
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,629
will complain they have not been

757
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:52,619
involved they didn't participate in the

758
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:58,539
standardization process or they are not

759
00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:00,819
keen on actually following it as usual

760
00:37:58,539 --> 00:38:02,709
with everything that is technical

761
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:07,749
related with risk and the devil is in

762
00:38:02,709 --> 00:38:10,269
the details so if one of the good things

763
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:13,569
that comes out of this standard is that

764
00:38:10,269 --> 00:38:15,538
the awareness is made that okay you need

765
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:18,940
entick ation you need to encrypt your

766
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:23,170
communication and so forth but the devil

767
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:26,410
is always in the details so there is

768
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,609
likely to be a project or a vendor or I

769
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,449
don't know sure where you take your

770
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:33,640
privacy series but sure we use secure

771
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:35,890
boot but we store the key in unprotected

772
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,160
memory these are likely phrases that

773
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:41,489
might or might not actually happen but

774
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,399
if they eventually happen I call dibs on

775
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:49,390
them yeah sure we use TLS but we don't

776
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,549
pin has happened for smartphone apps has

777
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:56,109
happened for everything on the Internet

778
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:57,699
I find it unlikely to that the

779
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:00,880
automotive industry is not repeating

780
00:38:57,699 --> 00:39:03,009
this sure we have individual keys but no

781
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,749
true random number generator so this is

782
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:09,940
the Sony flaw which may or may not

783
00:39:06,749 --> 00:39:14,939
actually manifest itself in actually

784
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:18,249
weakening encryption than increasing it

785
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,859
so don't wanna jinx it but I think the

786
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:24,669
this standard will be good mostly

787
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:27,640
because people will at least

788
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:30,729
manufacturer suppliers and customers

789
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,339
have something to talk about so they

790
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:36,430
have a specific set of recommendations

791
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:37,089
and requirements that they can walk

792
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:40,089
along

793
00:39:37,089 --> 00:39:41,819
however cars are really really complex

794
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:45,299
they

795
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:50,219
have again an attack surface as large as

796
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:53,009
a tent and it's all in the details we'll

797
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:56,369
see how that works out so I'm optimistic

798
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:58,650
but I'm rather optimistic person however

799
00:39:56,369 --> 00:40:02,150
feel that we as a community and in

800
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:06,569
particular as technicians who actually

801
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:12,620
tinker with our physical things can work

802
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:23,170
on improving that thank you very much

803
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:23,170
[Applause]

804
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:32,550
is there a microphone angel running

805
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:47,399
around you have a microphone I'll repeat

806
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:48,510
the question for the stream so the

807
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,520
question was if there's anything

808
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,340
regarding autonomous driving in there

809
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,730
not specifically no this is a distinct

810
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,100
topic there are there's a different SAE

811
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:02,340
a standard which defines different

812
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,170
levels of autonomous driving that I'm

813
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,780
aware of but that doesn't doesn't

814
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:10,590
include security so they are kind of

815
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,450
distinct and of course if you want to

816
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,850
have autonomous driving it's a good

817
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,759
thing to actually include security so

818
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:21,350
the awareness is is there in that regard

819
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,350
but it's not included in this standard

820
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,370
any other questions

821
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,200
great so I'll be around I think next

822
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,720
item on the timetable is lunch thank you

823
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,109
very much

824
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:49,138
