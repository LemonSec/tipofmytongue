1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,250
okay so my name is ravi shankar bulgogi

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,490
I work in mobile communication since

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,830
last ten years almost since I started to

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,890
do my master studies it was still telco

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,290
so it's been long played that I'm

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:23,630
working with telco protocol stacks and

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,849
networks as well and and I have with me

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,490
Altaf

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,800
he is currently in Germany where Berlin

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,099
where he's doing a PhD now about to

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,489
finish

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,880
he will tell more about him and this is

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,260
the talk so partly we also presented in

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,170
blackhat so how many people were in

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:46,010
blackhat so I don't know who you've seen

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:48,560
this or not so so up to you if you want

17
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,230
to repeat but I think we got a feedback

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,059
that we only talk about 5g radio

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,459
protocols that we've been actively

20
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,800
working on 4G and Phi J specification

21
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,750
because that has been frozen and that's

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,780
that's been what we're gonna see on the

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,610
market now and this is what we've been

24
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,659
doing and this is the main area but many

25
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,740
people wanted to also see what the Phi G

26
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,359
security is about what people are

27
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,699
talking about some countries are being

28
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,429
banned or some vendors are being banned

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,130
what's controversy is going on so we

30
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:21,020
thought we add some 15-20 minutes on

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,060
that part to explain what the 5g

32
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,920
transition is about and and then we come

33
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,560
back to the Phi zero do protocol the

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,039
fact that what we present so how many

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,990
people really know Phi G in detail or or

36
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:35,569
let's say they heard of something they

37
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,759
know what in inside looks like or 4G at

38
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:40,720
is how many people know in the room

39
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,430
don't be shy I'm not going to say that

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,900
you work for operator but he just if you

41
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:46,150
know if you can just say yes or no okay

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,619
it's very few people so I'm not going in

43
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,540
detail but I just try to explain you

44
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:55,060
what this Phi G or type says rather than

45
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,530
rather than rather than saying what Phi

46
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,659
geez I'm not really still gonna say if

47
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,270
IG has a high-speed Internet or a low

48
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,190
latency you can do remote surgery what

49
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,229
people say about use case of Phi G

50
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,149
that's everybody's talking but I will

51
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,949
just try it technically what this Phi G

52
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,890
means so so we're gonna get two types of

53
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,070
Phi G in the Europe right now so this is

54
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,809
basically you have a 4G infrastructure

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,420
that is being everywhere in Europe or

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,000
all over the world and basically people

57
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,859
will just deploy Phi G base station and

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,500
they will hook those base station to the

59
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,750
existing 4G core network and that's like

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,640
one type of Phi G that we are already

61
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,220
seeing now everywhere you are hearing

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,589
that something some companies are trying

63
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,840
pilot project or or in Asia they have

64
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,000
launched the Phi G network also in Sudan

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,739
for example so this is like this kind of

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
network we have so it's just a Phi G

67
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,730
base station we have a Phi G base

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,760
stations and they are connected to the

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,920
4G and that's we call non standalone

70
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,640
more network this is what we gonna sing

71
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,140
nowadays but this has no problem because

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,820
what you are hearing the controversy

73
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,890
about this is not about this network

74
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,690
okay because this is quite people

75
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,000
believe that they're safe and it's under

76
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:06,760
control of the mobile operators but

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,220
people are afraid or making so much

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,959
complications is about the second type

79
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,420
of network which really has the unique

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,190
feature of Phi G which is basically a

81
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,200
low latency where you have a high-speed

82
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,630
network highest higher than what we have

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,730
with this first type of Phi G and this

84
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,769
is basically you will have a Phi G base

85
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,560
stations which are attached with a real

86
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,630
Phi G core network this is called Phi G

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,190
standalone network and this is what

88
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:32,859
people are afraid of are talking about

89
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,450
how what we should do or how should we

90
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:37,209
deploy this network so this is like a

91
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,670
mix complication and what we what I try

92
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,350
to give some hint about what is the

93
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,940
problem with this second type of network

94
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,650
and why people are

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,800
some controversies along this right okay

96
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,780
first of all I mean Wi-Fi is really

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,660
important this is just a point I wanted

98
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,300
to highlight you so roughly what is the

99
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,430
average fibers the broadband speed you

100
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,170
get you get at your house so let's

101
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,840
assume that it's 100 Mbps something

102
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,329
right I I say average right so you may

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,650
be getting 1 Gbps with a fiber fiber to

104
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,720
home or something like this but the

105
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,350
point is if IG is about to give you 1

106
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,570
Gbps wireless speed would you dig start

107
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,358
to dig the ground or or can I imagine

108
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,070
after 10 years when I buy a TV it will

109
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,810
come with the embedded SIM card and I

110
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,990
don't need to plug any cable to my TV

111
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,700
and I it will just works wirelessly you

112
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,290
just hook the power and that's it so you

113
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,640
don't need to put any cable modem

114
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,400
anything like this because you have a 1

115
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,530
Gbps speed which you pay let's say 50

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,780
ro4 per month or something like with the

117
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,119
plan unlimited data so people will not

118
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,219
have a cable to any IOT device or any

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,410
smart any smart device which you deploy

120
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,910
in the house so this may happen so what

121
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,670
the point is basically then we are

122
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,730
talking about a network which will carry

123
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:52,960
all the device data through the mobile

124
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,400
network so so most of the devices Alvie

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,349
I mean already we are using mobile

126
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,690
network for many purposes right so how

127
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,970
many you use move your mobile for many

128
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,950
services right nowadays at least banking

129
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,510
your you check business email or many

130
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,430
things like this and now we're gonna

131
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,620
increase more and this dead that that

132
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,760
says that Phi G will after 10 years may

133
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,010
become a national critical

134
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,380
infrastructure itself so it will carry

135
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,940
more data than even what we carry over

136
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,890
the broadband connection right now even

137
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,260
enterprise business as well so that

138
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,820
makes situation complicated that every

139
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,680
every data is being transmitted over

140
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,120
this network now what's the problem with

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,060
this network on this on this

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,220
architecture in that scenario right so

143
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,780
just to briefly explain so I just

144
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,880
explained this now in a normal figure

145
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,799
and what's the problem is so what you

146
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,450
see on the left side is basically we

147
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,430
call radio access network that's a

148
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
technical term we we called in mobile

149
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,360
networks so this is like every network

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,100
you can divide in this category okay so

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,600
left side you have a mobile phone and a

152
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,120
base station so everybody has mobile

153
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,789
phone then you see mobile base stations

154
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,500
on buildings or somewhere and that's

155
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,780
whole block is called radio access

156
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,800
network okay and that is common in every

157
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,750
mobile network

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,979
even in Fiji okay that's not gonna

159
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,810
change and that's what we have first

160
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:04,599
type of fight G and the second block is

161
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,639
which part we call core network and this

162
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,860
is basically a closed ward and why why I

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,810
put this green symbol because if you

164
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,280
want to hack into this infrastructure

165
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,080
it's not that easy because it's not

166
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,698
connected to internet straight ahead of

167
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,818
course there are some exceptions but

168
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,440
still this is quite close border so if

169
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,509
you I need to access this one I just

170
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,889
need to send some guy or I just need to

171
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,389
break some building and get access to

172
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,539
this for example because this is still

173
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,069
closed warden until 4G okay and and this

174
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:32,139
is what I want it explains what exactly

175
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,210
changed and now when we come to Phi G

176
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,620
things has been changed now so what you

177
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,419
see this block diagram this is the

178
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,080
standard diagram which has been

179
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,000
finalised by the 3gpp the the entity

180
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,680
which designed the Phi's architecture so

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,409
this is the exact figure we have been

182
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,870
discuss and and this will be shipping

183
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,280
all the 5g core networks but what is

184
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,259
interesting I'm not going to explain you

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,090
all the point but I just won't tell you

186
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,979
two key differences here really two

187
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,359
important when people were designing

188
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,310
these standards they were thinking of

189
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,500
because everybody talks about okay tell

190
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,759
me where the encryption starts and ends

191
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,889
because that's what you wanted to know

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,590
whether this architecture has end-to-end

193
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,449
security or not and when people started

194
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,400
to design the protocol this was also hot

195
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,590
topic so where should be our ending

196
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,929
encryption ending point so if I ask you

197
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,960
people when you make a mobile phone call

198
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,669
you do many times or you use internet do

199
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,349
you know where your encryption ends when

200
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,448
you make a call on 4G do you know

201
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:26,830
anybody know in the room let's say your

202
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,050
encryption starts from your mobile phone

203
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,880
and do you know where it ends I'm not

204
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,770
talking about I'm not talking about SSL

205
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,199
or application level I'm just talking

206
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:42,539
about call specific yeah BTS so this

207
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,539
guy's correct 4G ohh-ho-ho how about 3G

208
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:50,560
tooji okay I tell you in 2g encryption

209
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,550
ends on base station

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,349
in 4G ends on base station in 3G it

211
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,599
never ends on base station it ends on

212
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,840
radio network controller that's another

213
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:05,409
hop which you no longer have access and

214
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,159
in Phi G lots of debate happen and again

215
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:10,990
encryption is ending on base station so

216
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:12,729
if you compare encryption the ending

217
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,000
point 3G is the best technology you had

218
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:17,409
so far and which we about to kill

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,330
because encryption ends on radio network

220
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,860
or at controller there and here as well

221
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,900
what you see on the left side it's a

222
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:24,550
it's a ue means mobile phone and and

223
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,409
then you have used your mobile phone SIM

224
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,509
card so encryption starts from there

225
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:30,280
it's n on the G note B that's called

226
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,990
base station okay there are some

227
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,848
carriers they have done some smart trick

228
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,320
there to prevent that somebody can

229
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,300
compromise base station and can

230
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,240
intercept calls for example or channels

231
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,859
and and basically it ends on a base

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,570
station but from there there is

233
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,450
encryption as well it's not like there

234
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,339
is no encryption but there is encryption

235
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:51,190
which can be IPSec tunnel for example

236
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:53,260
which goes to the core network and it's

237
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,390
a mandatory sometimes optional but if

238
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,920
you can ask to any of your operator a

239
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,810
friend of you if you have a friend who

240
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,370
works in mobile company do you really

241
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,779
use those tunnels or not I'd be sick

242
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,070
many people say no we don't use it

243
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,329
because we believe that it's our own

244
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,920
network we don't care about putting

245
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,170
IPSec tunnel or anything so it's a plane

246
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,610
take some time within the network but of

247
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,930
course when you have a small base

248
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,990
station of course we have IPSec

249
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,120
encryption there and rest of the blocks

250
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,860
are there is a funny thing about a rest

251
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,779
of the block so right now in 4G the

252
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,060
similar kind of a core network we have a

253
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:24,760
dedicated IT hardware for each and every

254
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,750
block of this component of a network but

255
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:32,019
in Phi G those blocks I mean H of every

256
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,170
block can be a cloud network so we

257
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:36,670
deploy all these blocks in the cloud and

258
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,430
this is what the file architecture is

259
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,740
called service base architecture and it

260
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,229
use rest based java api is to deliver

261
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,699
new services create new api so it's

262
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,760
basically they are trying to integrate

263
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:51,099
all the IT or in internet kind of

264
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,170
architecture into this mechanism right

265
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,579
now and this this makes things little

266
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,860
bit complicated and I try to explain

267
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:57,839
again

268
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,240
which scenario so this file Chico

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,010
Network has been transferred so this is

270
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,779
the biggest change in Phi Chico network

271
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:06,540
and this is what people are afraid of

272
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:08,610
something and and why it's problematic

273
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,240
because it's uses different disciplines

274
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,800
of IT and disciplines are basically it

275
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,170
uses cloud computing is uses

276
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,699
programmable Network it also uses mobile

277
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,860
edge computing network function

278
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,070
virtualization like Sdn and many things

279
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:26,310
and every technology has its own

280
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,060
security issues and now all this has to

281
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,489
be tackled when you deploy 5g network

282
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,170
and if I tell you now if I build it

283
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,269
those blocks and if I look at the

284
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:40,319
architecture there is one element they

285
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,880
have to trust hypervisor so can you

286
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
imagine now you have to trust your

287
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,779
hypervisor completely in order to

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,180
provide all this kind of security

289
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,800
principles on 5g core network and I'm

290
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,089
not saying I provide is the best thing

291
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,620
but how many people really trust the

292
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,079
hypervisor when they deploy something

293
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,279
with hypervisor architecture we really

294
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:01,349
trust I paralyze them so this is like a

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,510
different area which we are heading for

296
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,390
words and and again this is also kind of

297
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,439
a difference I tried to say so if I

298
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,300
compare with the existing architecture

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,250
and now with the new architecture we

300
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,349
have a less separated of core network

301
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,800
and related network radio network

302
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,020
controller then all the software's and

303
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,849
hardware are basically it just you run

304
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,079
the bare metal it could be a data center

305
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,720
and then you run all the building blocks

306
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,060
on data centers and the funny thing is

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,430
how many people know ss7 attacks ss7

308
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,869
attacks been in telco I think Belgium

309
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,069
must be knowing many things about those

310
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,070
as well

311
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:37,140
so ss7 was really a signaling protocol

312
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,240
which is still being used in until 4G

313
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,750
and it has been shown that this has been

314
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,750
used by various entities to hack you an

315
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,640
SMS so dps as well I mean they they not

316
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,820
only track people but they can also hack

317
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,209
your SMS OTP even get encrypted calls as

318
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,339
well

319
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,949
and now files you decided that we're not

320
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,790
going to use this as seven but we will

321
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:04,109
use the web-based protocol and this will

322
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,569
be basically in protocol protected over

323
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,670
HTTP TLS and all the certificate based

324
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,600
mechanism is a good thing but at the

325
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,699
same time is a char

326
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,949
so every two operators will be

327
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:16,589
interconnected with them with using some

328
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,810
risk-based Java API is protected over

329
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,250
SSL and TLS for example so we are coming

330
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,050
to our sort of things all internet

331
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,730
standards and now we have to rely on

332
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,589
certificate management's and everything

333
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,480
for those core networks it's a good good

334
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,610
approach but it has to be properly

335
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,500
configured in that scenario okay so what

336
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,170
exactly makes this situation complicated

337
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,519
so what exactly we will have a increase

338
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,560
attack surface many people say is

339
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,449
increasing attack surface but what

340
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,758
exactly that means right on the radio

341
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:43,439
level side it is fine is called obvious

342
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,269
you still have a radio channel it means

343
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,740
this can be attack even though you have

344
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,410
encrypted we have a jamming attacks

345
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,750
right and the one point is from the 5g

346
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,490
architecture this is also I see from

347
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,410
last couple of psi I am doing research

348
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,560
as well so when we design these

349
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,149
standards let's assume that if I give

350
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,768
you a challenge let's design a protocol

351
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,750
and you have a mobile phone and you have

352
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:05,670
a base station and now you want it to

353
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,009
establish some kind of secure channel so

354
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,959
how do you design and and during the

355
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:11,670
design phase what people said that they

356
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,500
always give the higher power or higher

357
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,029
authority to the base station so base

358
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,949
station is a master and your mobile

359
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,660
phone is slave and that's what I use the

360
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:21,329
terminology in mobile communication your

361
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,339
mobile phone is smart but it is a dumb

362
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:25,138
or slave device it has no negotiation

363
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,610
for example base station says let's

364
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:29,850
stock plain text your mobile phone just

365
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,529
talks plain text it has no power to say

366
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,420
that let's use this encryption it has no

367
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:34,949
power there is there are options but the

368
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,860
options are chosen by the base station

369
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:41,370
only not the mobile phone and that still

370
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:44,089
sim same in Fiji as well and again this

371
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,259
is due to the legacy systems or also

372
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,850
some flexibility so this is still we

373
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,680
have this problem then of course then

374
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,329
you have all the classical attack you

375
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,819
can have a bidding down attacks asking

376
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:55,920
5g mobile phones go back to 4G go back

377
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,599
to 3G go back to 2g because your mobile

378
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,449
phone will be talking all those

379
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,339
technologies not only Phi G and and how

380
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,139
many people in the room really can know

381
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,579
that they can you lock your mobile phone

382
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,660
on 4G only have you tried this or do you

383
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,529
know that there is a feature at least

384
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,969
for you actually you can you can go on

385
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,350
your mobile phone and check the mobile

386
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,000
network settings and there is option

387
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,019
actually you can select the network 4g

388
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,110
3g 2g

389
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:23,470
4g 3g or 4g but very few phone give you

390
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,080
the option 4g only

391
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,690
but it also has a disadvantage if you if

392
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,070
you put you your phone on 4G only if you

393
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,480
go to some places you will not get

394
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:33,280
coverage so you will be out of coverage

395
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,720
for example you're not going to receive

396
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,160
any call so that's the problem so you

397
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,810
never bring down attacks you have a

398
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,780
denial of service attacks then you have

399
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,520
a tracking an interception as well on

400
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,680
the radio side as long as you're if you

401
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,600
don't use proper encryption methods as

402
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,910
well but in Co network this increase

403
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,770
attack surface as I said we're gonna use

404
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,240
cloud security principles we have a

405
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,550
virtualization security when you use

406
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,470
hypervisors as well and third party API

407
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,589
security which is somewhat little bit

408
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,030
complicated and and and this this way I

409
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,860
explain you unseen are you know what

410
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,600
exactly been happen and and what this

411
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,580
phi gene I just made a small use case to

412
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,070
explain you the scenario so assume this

413
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,650
is the case of 2027 something like this

414
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,390
when full Phi G is deployed people start

415
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,650
to use many devices which are being

416
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,210
using base station and they are

417
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,890
connected to the cloud base core

418
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:21,070
networks so this could be a data center

419
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,650
close to the base station this is what

420
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:25,150
we call edge cloud Center in Phi G so it

421
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,220
means that some of the building blocks

422
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,740
can they can be deployed on to this edge

423
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,390
cloud where you no longer need a core

424
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,780
network to be support so this is also a

425
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,819
scenario something goes bad a city

426
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,770
should be I mean a city like Ghent

427
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,390
should have his own mobile network and

428
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,500
they should not rely on a central part

429
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,030
of core network and you can have

430
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,660
everything in edge so this is one

431
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,310
example and this is a infrastructure

432
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,439
which has been using hypervisor based

433
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,810
security and then it creates a different

434
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,480
slice slice means virtual machine biggsy

435
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,949
so let's let's put abstract it's a

436
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,540
virtual machine and then you have a

437
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,250
different instance of those clouds and

438
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,050
first cloud is for gaming services

439
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,690
because Phi Z has the best use case that

440
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,609
you can use VR based games with 1gbps

441
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:09,460
speed and and that's like for users so

442
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,770
that's one cloud for only for those

443
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,500
users one cloud for electricity let's

444
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,060
say smart grid and one is for operator

445
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,830
via an app it means that is for a normal

446
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,680
mobile services so what this really

447
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,570
means is basically when anymore any user

448
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,459
on this left block wants to use mobile

449
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,110
service so the base station decides

450
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,550
which category of device is and they

451
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,910
will offer the service through this one

452
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,219
block so your traffic will be dedicated

453
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:36,040
to different blocks of the cloud for

454
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,430
example and similar way many companies

455
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,050
can buy those service

456
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,579
locks from mobile operator saying that

457
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,829
fine I'm a car company

458
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,050
I want my all autonomous car data in a

459
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,490
separate block and this is the best use

460
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,170
case for Phi G as well so you can have a

461
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,600
dedicated service for autonomous cars

462
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,849
every car using mobile network will have

463
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,649
a traffic going to their own cloud which

464
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,360
will be quite separated but now

465
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,880
everybody's relying on a security of

466
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,830
hypervisor basically there and now you

467
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,839
have to make sure that if something goes

468
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,459
wrong with the hypervisors data should

469
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,929
not be leaked and you need to give a

470
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,120
guarantee that ok you need to have a

471
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,250
segregation of traffic I mean in the

472
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,958
hardware level as well and this is this

473
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,179
is who I quite keep challenging for

474
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,339
mobile operator I mean you can do for

475
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:18,500
some entities but how do you scale this

476
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,208
aggregation that's that's the main

477
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,980
problem which I provide this as well I

478
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,199
mean how do you scale those aggregation

479
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,459
of civil traffic using hardware and

480
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,620
software level techniques and this is

481
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,780
this is a main problem actually and

482
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,330
that's what many people say it's a tag

483
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,240
it's an increasing attack surface and

484
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:39,919
and the second thing I try to give an

485
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,360
example of incident is basically how

486
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:48,440
many people know this Greek wiretapping

487
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:51,050
scandal yes very very few people know ok

488
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,940
and I just I just giving example because

489
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,309
why this is important so this is

490
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,840
basically is called Athens affair so

491
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:58,639
what exactly this means every mobile

492
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,070
company should have a lawful interface

493
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,350
it's called Li interface and that means

494
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,600
that you're every mobile phone and SMS

495
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,399
is being stored on this block okay this

496
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,350
is mandatory for everybody and nowadays

497
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,179
we also have this infrastructure but we

498
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,919
have a dedicated machine or

499
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:16,130
infrastructure or building which which

500
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,290
handles this part but now in Fiji we may

501
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,660
not know that this block will go in a

502
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,159
cloud cloud or somewhere for example

503
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,570
where you have to rely on separation

504
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,030
something but what happened in Greece

505
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,879
actually back in 2007 I think remember

506
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,740
that time so this has been developed by

507
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,330
one vendor and even I don't know

508
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,650
actually I'd I try to investigate what

509
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,689
kind of operating system these blocks

510
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,250
really then what kind of hardware

511
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,990
software configuration they have are

512
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,120
they connected to internet or not I

513
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:45,550
tried to dig lots of information but I

514
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,139
couldn't find it but in 2007 one country

515
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,360
had a special malware for this kind of

516
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,640
piece of machined

517
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,919
they did install malware on this machine

518
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,520
it was running flawlessly for six-month

519
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,650
and what it was doing it was tapping

520
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,600
communication calls of almost some of

521
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:04,850
the minister of Greece Greek government

522
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,149
as well as prime minister of Greece he

523
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,980
was being live tap using this interface

524
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,230
and one cable was going to one embassy

525
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,530
of country and this was happening

526
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,260
flawlessly for six month imagine 2007

527
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,730
they had this capability now we are

528
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,570
thinking about having this kind of

529
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,430
machines into a cloud okay and you have

530
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,870
to be really clear sure that and trust

531
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,520
that this will be you'll have a safe

532
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,530
it's a similar kind of guarantee on

533
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,139
those interfaces and this read this

534
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,420
really tells you the problem of scope

535
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,790
what kind of telco blocks we need to

536
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,110
handle when we think of having Co

537
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,720
network with with virtualization

538
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,580
techniques as well yeah so I skip this

539
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,200
one also we have the problems of Co

540
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,600
Network as well this is also I give a

541
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,100
one best example so there was one

542
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,770
company in Belgium who was doing pen

543
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,780
testing with some Belgian operator and

544
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:56,420
by mistake some of the fuzzing packets

545
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,430
came to Norway because every mobile is

546
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,500
operators are being interconnected to

547
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,970
each other and the packet arrived to the

548
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,790
Norwegian operator and actually their

549
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,970
HLR the main center of system or the

550
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,920
main server of telco got crash and it

551
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,950
took three days to recover it only by

552
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,690
not understanding few fuzzing packets so

553
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,430
the point is we are talking about a

554
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,580
telco network putting into some blocks

555
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,110
and and we haven't been really taken

556
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,730
care of lots of pentesting and

557
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,679
infrastructure for different blocks and

558
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,300
this kind of problems happens as well

559
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,270
and then we have a different incidents

560
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,370
like Snowden you already know that so at

561
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,830
least no document says that they have a

562
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,169
OTA keys which means over there keys and

563
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,030
master key which is ki which is for SIM

564
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,240
card because every SIM card has a main

565
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,700
key ki if I got your ki key it is

566
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,800
possible until 3g and 4g I can decrypt

567
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,510
your calls in Phi G it may not be

568
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,060
because we improved some mechanisms

569
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:55,430
there but nowadays relying on more on e

570
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:57,710
same how many people use iPad air 2 very

571
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,070
few people do use somebody uses a

572
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:03,610
SmartWatch i I phone Apple Apple watch I

573
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,080
for series for series Phi

574
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,850
so basically you have embedded a sim

575
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,049
card on your mobile phone and do you

576
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,988
know how do you change the mobile

577
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:14,408
subscriber when you use when you change

578
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:15,909
the SIM card basically future devices

579
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,610
will have embedded a SIM card which you

580
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,899
cannot take out for example right and in

581
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,070
this case you will go to the operator

582
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:22,268
saying that I wanted to change the

583
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,460
subscription and you will get a new

584
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:27,580
operator but what happened is actually

585
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:31,119
your secret key K I will be transmitted

586
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,090
over there to your to your SIM card so

587
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,980
it comes over there using using OTA keys

588
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,629
which is over there key for example and

589
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,039
as stolen document already said that

590
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,899
they had infrastructure I mean they

591
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,460
already bypassed some OTA keys as well

592
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,018
for example I mean again I'm not saying

593
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,489
that it will be good but again we

594
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,499
relying on some key mechanisms and

595
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:51,070
something and this like a single source

596
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:52,720
of and again as an user for me I can't

597
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,359
take out the SIM card or how can you

598
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,710
ensure that okay is it's kind of a

599
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:59,470
different problem with embedded SIM card

600
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,629
and denial of service attack I skip and

601
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,299
now we talked about radio side or

602
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:06,399
attacking radio protocols especially on

603
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:09,429
4G and that's also affects Phi G and now

604
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,988
we start with attacking radio side here

605
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,720
Altaf will talk about the radio side and

606
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:16,649
then I will talk about the protocol

607
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,649
authentication protocol vulnerabilities

608
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:55,929
excellent we have like more expertise

609
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,590
and then we start getting the hands

610
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,730
dirty so we found some did some like

611
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:02,500
fingerprinting attacks and

612
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:06,100
man-in-the-middle attacks on 5g protocol

613
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,380
so let's go through that so we know that

614
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,360
I think people are already aware of this

615
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,950
term called MC catcher so basically

616
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,110
these are some devices in

617
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,360
telecommunication networks that usually

618
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,270
intercept conversations or identities

619
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,490
like MC which is a permanent guarantee

620
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,930
of your SIM card and IME ice so

621
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,810
basically these identities are actually

622
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,760
protected in 5g so they're never

623
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,220
transmitted in plaintext to the to the

624
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,920
network so they're kind of safe so we

625
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,510
started looking a bit more into the 5g

626
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,580
protocols like how can we actually track

627
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,950
users or how can we actually fingerprint

628
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,580
devices and subscribers so then we came

629
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:45,130
across something called capabilities so

630
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,439
every device or every modem like has

631
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:49,600
certain capabilities so when I mean

632
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,760
capabilities I'm not talking about the

633
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,860
processor the Android processor or the

634
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,020
speed of the system so not this one but

635
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,719
the Cape the exact capabilities of the

636
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,639
modem so basically these are defined in

637
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,650
the standard and these are implemented

638
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,440
by the baseband vendors into the modem

639
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:08,410
so they program it and then they're like

640
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,020
somewhere around 500 MB or 500 bytes of

641
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,670
this information it talks about like

642
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,620
what kind of capabilities this device

643
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,000
supports there can be like two different

644
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,919
types the first one is like the

645
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,810
coordinate for capabilities which talks

646
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,850
about what kind of security algorithms

647
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,860
is the device supporting does it support

648
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,780
null algorithms or or the normal

649
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,479
traditional algorithms which which do

650
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,670
like AES on 4G or there are even better

651
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,380
ones on 5g saw so what kind of

652
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,000
algorithms and then something like does

653
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,370
the device support why is calling

654
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,840
facilities SMS later than v2x

655
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,729
capabilities which are coming up in the

656
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,350
future so these are some of the

657
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,630
network capabilities then the next one

658
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,399
is the radio access capabilities just by

659
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,560
the name it says like something about

660
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,060
the radio so basically it's about

661
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,010
frequency bands then what are the

662
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,560
physical air parameters mac parameters

663
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:55,360
then does it support my mo which is like

664
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,250
multi-input multi-output so this is

665
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,310
these are like some new techniques to

666
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,750
actually get high speeds on 4G and 5g so

667
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,020
and then there is something called

668
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,660
category so let's say a new iPhone like

669
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:11,020
like iPhone 11 has a Cat Cat 18 or cat

670
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,630
20 if you go back then Samsung Galaxy s4

671
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,210
was a cat 4 device so the higher the

672
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:19,840
version of the the phone or the model

673
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,010
then the higher the category so so

674
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,959
basically like these are some of the

675
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:25,960
different capabilities these are

676
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,850
something 5g specific like v2 X there is

677
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,190
something called ciot which is like

678
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,310
cellular IOT maybe if you have heard of

679
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,530
narrowband narrowband IOT or LTE M

680
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:37,870
protocol so these are something which

681
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,780
which are like devices coming up maybe

682
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,340
in a couple of years so these are some

683
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,310
of the radio capabilities I just took

684
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,870
some traces from the Wireshark so

685
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,190
basically these capabilities are sent to

686
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,379
the network when the device is

687
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,880
registering to the network so when you

688
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,410
insert a SIM card turn it on so

689
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,420
basically during the registration we see

690
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,860
that in the first step there is the core

691
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,170
network capabilities are sent to the

692
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,570
network then authentication and security

693
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,970
happens which is mutual so it's very

694
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:05,470
good then the next one is like the radio

695
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:08,350
capabilities are actually sent to the

696
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,300
network if you observe here closely so

697
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,250
all the capabilities are actually sent

698
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,590
to the network and then happens the

699
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,870
security or what the air which is in the

700
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,909
bottom and then these capabilities are

701
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,739
actually saved at the network I mean we

702
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,150
do not want to do the transmissions

703
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,650
again so we just want to optimize the

704
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,990
network so and then there's a

705
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,490
registration success so if we look here

706
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:30,520
carefully like these capabilities are

707
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,080
actually vulnerable to some passive and

708
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,850
active attacks so what kind of attacks

709
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,460
we'll see now so basically the problem

710
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,050
was you set up a rogue base station and

711
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,760
you can actually access these

712
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,440
capabilities without doing any kind of

713
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,540
security or authentication so you can

714
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,760
just skip them directly ask the device

715
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,550
just give me your capabilities and then

716
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,140
let's see what we can actually do so we

717
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,070
we try to see different types of attacks

718
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,660
one was the MN map

719
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,580
they're bringing on attack then a

720
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:59,000
battery drain attack which is especially

721
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,250
dedicated for iwata devices so for this

722
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,450
we build a set up so because like some

723
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,250
of the attacks needed to be a

724
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,640
man-in-the-middle it was not just a

725
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,050
sufficient to be a rogue base station so

726
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,630
you have to be a man in the middle so

727
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,820
basically you build a whole set up like

728
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,800
here we are using like two software

729
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,110
radios basically we stick to us our

730
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,600
piece you can also use other maybe a bit

731
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:24,229
cheaper versions like hack RF or or lime

732
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,480
SDR but these are quite stable so so

733
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,400
basically we build a rogue you note B

734
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,140
which nothing but a base station then

735
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,360
rogue you E which is nothing but the

736
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,550
rogue the phone side so both are

737
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,139
connected together and then whatever the

738
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,270
messages that are coming from the victim

739
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,490
UE so in this case I'm showing an iPhone

740
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:43,220
but it applies to all kinds of devices

741
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,110
which has which has any type of modem so

742
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,300
we are actually routing the traffic from

743
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,100
the victim UE to the rogue in would be

744
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,010
to the rogue UV and to the real network

745
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,889
so this is so we use some parts of

746
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,500
software from SRS LT so we extensity try

747
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,180
to modify them just add the capabilities

748
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,200
like whatever requires to be a

749
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:04,610
man-in-the-middle so there was a lot of

750
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,750
trouble playing with the timing of the

751
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:10,159
messages like so it was quite a bit of

752
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,350
programming and then try to get this

753
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:16,640
running so once we have this kind of

754
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:18,709
setup the first one was MN map so this

755
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,990
is nothing but the mobile network

756
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,270
mapping so we we are like familiar with

757
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,790
n map so basically and map what it does

758
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,670
it try to find out live hosts on the

759
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,170
network and then check what applications

760
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,600
it's running and then what operating

761
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,920
system the version so it tries to give

762
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,840
us open ports and I call this

763
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,840
information so we try to do a similar

764
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,730
thing on mobile networks so you try to

765
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,350
operate a rogue base station and then

766
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,810
you just try to find out what kind of

767
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,899
devices are surrounding you so it could

768
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,970
be a car mobile phone or IOT device or

769
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,920
an iPad so we try to distinguish each of

770
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,630
them and then try to find who is the

771
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,760
maker then the model the operating

772
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,720
systems and applications and then the

773
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,670
version if possible so this is the kind

774
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,990
of tree that we build so basically we

775
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,680
follow a tree style

776
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,780
where

777
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,460
try to first identify the basement like

778
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,040
who is the maker of this then the model

779
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,660
if then from that like we try to

780
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,730
identify if it's a cellular device then

781
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,520
if it is a little RI were to device then

782
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,650
from that is it a phone or is it another

783
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,840
type of device but if it's a phone then

784
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,360
you could possibly do Android or iOS I

785
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,280
mean we skip the rest of them not much

786
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,320
market there so then there's Android

787
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,750
different types of Android trying to

788
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:32,360
distinguish what it is then if it's an I

789
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:35,330
was trying to find is it an iPhone watch

790
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,649
or an iPad and then also if possible in

791
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,169
some cases like you could also get the

792
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:41,990
version of the operating system then the

793
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,880
other side we try to find if it's a car

794
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,830
modem or if it's a railway Mordan there

795
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,040
are some techniques how you figure it

796
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:52,429
out then you can also figure out like

797
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,960
USB sticks then routers laptop so we try

798
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,430
to create a huge database that actually

799
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,650
allows us to fingerprint all these

800
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,150
different type of devices on the other

801
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,430
side like on the IOT side there are

802
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,680
different narrowband IOT and then I mean

803
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:06,140
these devices are not as popular as on

804
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,120
the left ones so we couldn't have enough

805
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,160
information about the narrowband IOT

806
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,879
device but still I think it's not a big

807
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,680
big issue it's okay you might ask me

808
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,510
like okay why is this identification or

809
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,730
fingerprinting possible two reasons

810
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,920
because the basement vendors like they

811
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:24,470
implement the capabilities differently

812
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,390
because it's not really mandatory to

813
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,220
implement or to enable all these

814
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,500
capabilities in the basement so some of

815
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:32,270
them enable or some of them disable it

816
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,950
so there are some differences in that

817
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,070
how you can actually use them to

818
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,410
identify each basement vendor then the

819
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,020
next one is each target application

820
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:44,630
requires different set of capabilities

821
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:47,120
to be active for example if we take a

822
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,830
phone I mean obviously you need voice

823
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,360
codec capabilities to be active I mean

824
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,720
without that you cannot make the voice

825
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,280
cones or if you take a USB stick I think

826
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,080
mostly we are using this for data

827
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,120
purposes so I think the voice

828
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,439
capabilities would be off and then the

829
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,929
other capabilities which are required

830
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,420
for data transmission are active or take

831
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,670
something for an automated car you have

832
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:09,710
this v2x capabilities always-on or else

833
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,880
the network doesn't know that this is a

834
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,920
v2x device so

835
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,900
for this we try to create actually try

836
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,940
to build a model first we try to gather

837
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,580
somewhere around like 70 to 80 devices

838
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:23,800
like all kinds of phones all kinds of

839
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,590
some cars some devices from the military

840
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:32,260
some some from the like USB sticks

841
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:35,709
laptops iPads some cars yeah so a lot of

842
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,930
devices and then try to acquire the

843
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,710
capabilities from them just construct a

844
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,390
huge model

845
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,550
so basically when I am saving these

846
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,850
capabilities in in the Wireshark I try

847
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:48,159
to like just put the name of it what's

848
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,050
the device then who is the baseband then

849
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,760
what model it's running on what model of

850
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:55,540
the basement it's running I try to save

851
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,370
it in this way and from then once I have

852
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:59,470
this big model and then I can actually

853
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,020
try to go in the while and then just

854
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,330
collect random capabilities compared

855
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,190
with the model and then extract what

856
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,860
kind of device this could be for example

857
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,900
something a prince I bring out some

858
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,360
fingerprints here to identify like a

859
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:16,720
specifically Qualcomm basements you

860
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,000
could look for something called e is

861
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,460
zero it's an integrity algorithm in 4G

862
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,770
and it's usually it's analytically to

863
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,990
algorithm and then it's always disabled

864
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:27,790
in Qualcomm based chipsets and then the

865
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,710
rest of them enable it we don't have a

866
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,659
specific reason it could be that they

867
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:35,710
could activate them dynamically when

868
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:38,110
when required but but like I think 90%

869
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,600
or a 95% of the devices from Qualcomm VC

870
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,760
is like it's always disabled if you take

871
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,800
something from MediaTek then they have

872
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,540
this measurement capability which is

873
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,909
always on then the rest of them just

874
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,620
disable it so the thing is like it's not

875
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,630
really mandatory to implement some of

876
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:54,250
these capabilities so with this you

877
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:59,170
could use them and then try to identify

878
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:01,690
what kind of device it could be did I

879
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:04,030
skip okay once you know who is the

880
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:06,340
basement maker of this you just go on

881
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,350
wiki and then try to find out from that

882
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,419
particular model you just click on one

883
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,980
of this it will give you like a list of

884
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,870
devices that are actually using this

885
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,610
processor or this particular basement

886
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,189
model

887
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:19,780
so once you have this like you have list

888
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,930
of supported devices and then we want to

889
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,210
fight I dent if I like what kind of

890
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,130
application is this device running so

891
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,560
from that okay before that we have to

892
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,380
split between IOT device and then like

893
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,610
normal cellular device so there are some

894
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,150
specific capabilities which can actually

895
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,500
distinguish both of them then we found

896
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,300
certain specific capabilities that

897
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,800
actually distinguish between phone and

898
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:46,149
other type of devices like codecs or

899
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,710
voice domain preference settings like

900
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,430
these are something specific for phones

901
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:54,760
and phones always have them enabled some

902
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:56,710
some common fingerprints is like whoever

903
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,600
I phones always use huawei basement and

904
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:00,250
Samsung devices use Samsung basement I

905
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,010
mean Samsung could also use a Qualcomm

906
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,230
basement but there's a different way how

907
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:09,480
you distinguish then Apple you have only

908
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:11,740
two choices maybe one in the future so

909
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,380
then this was a bit hard trying to

910
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:15,819
differentiate Android and iOS devices

911
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,850
these are the only two capabilities that

912
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,650
are related to two GPS it's always

913
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,779
enabled in Android devices I don't know

914
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,160
why Apple disabled it I mean there's no

915
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,030
compulsion that you have to enable it

916
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,560
but but yeah so this is it's good that

917
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:32,620
you find some fingerprints and then you

918
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,690
could use it for this detection I also

919
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,389
have like other capability like that

920
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,159
could be used for fingerprinting or like

921
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,949
trying to find out the version maybe we

922
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,810
could discuss it later so but most

923
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,870
importantly like some things when you

924
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:49,330
are doing fingerprinting is there are

925
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,339
some issues for example different SIM

926
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,960
cards can actually SIM cards can play a

927
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,760
key role different SIM cards can

928
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,790
actually activate and deactivate certain

929
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,170
capabilities so this is the place where

930
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:01,540
an attacker might actually get tricked

931
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,270
so that you might result in a false

932
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:09,850
positive some sometimes this is

933
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:11,710
something to care about then so the

934
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:15,190
important thing it is like you try to

935
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,840
build a model as big as possible that

936
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,460
that helps for a better detection or

937
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,810
like that that gives you like an

938
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,390
accurate result in the end

939
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,610
so it's not necessary that you have to

940
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,080
operate an oak base station to actually

941
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,690
get this capabilities you can also do

942
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,069
these things passively just because we

943
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,620
are used to operating rogue base

944
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,120
stations we just try it this way because

945
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,920
like passive it's possible because you

946
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,810
saw that the capabilities are sent to

947
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,640
the network before establishing any kind

948
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,920
of security so they are usually going in

949
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,170
plaintext

950
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,790
you could actually link this

951
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:50,600
capabilities to a particular MC maybe

952
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,800
you also in 5g then launched our target

953
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,140
specific attacks once you know the

954
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,550
operating system so it's and then the

955
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,290
nice thing what we are doing is like we

956
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,420
are willing to share this kind of traces

957
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,910
or the kind of big model that we have it

958
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:05,030
which automatically like spits you out

959
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:09,859
what kind of the exact information that

960
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:11,270
you need from the from the tool ok so

961
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,370
there was about the fingerprinting then

962
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:16,250
we tried the man the middle attack with

963
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:18,200
the bidding down so like we saw in the

964
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,910
during the registration procedure where

965
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,240
the capabilities are actually sent to

966
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:25,190
the network before the OTA security over

967
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,509
there security so being a

968
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,050
man-in-the-middle what we try to do is

969
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,910
like we try to modify these capabilities

970
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,680
and then send it to the network and the

971
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,930
network actually saves all these

972
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,549
capabilities at the core network so next

973
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,680
time when you are doing a transmission

974
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,540
or sending a message again the phone is

975
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,339
actually not asking the device or the

976
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,560
network is not asking the device to

977
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,480
resend its capabilities it will just get

978
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,140
it back from the core network and then

979
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,300
reuse them so if you manage to save fake

980
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,540
capabilities over the core network so

981
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,400
until you actually restart your device

982
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,380
the the base station is actually using

983
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,940
fake or that modified capabilities of

984
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,400
the device so what kind of modifications

985
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,680
we could do we could just change the

986
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,990
category like we just downgrade the

987
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,149
category from for example like a cat 16

988
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:13,729
device which is supposed to have a speed

989
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:15,650
of like 300 or 400 Mbps you just bring

990
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,650
it to cat phone device which which has

991
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,810
like maximum speed of maybe 50 or I mean

992
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,500
if you are looking on a live network it

993
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:26,990
could be up to 1 Mbps like real networks

994
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,640
you disable like specific parameters

995
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:31,069
that can actually kill the speed like

996
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,660
the carrier aggregation then my mo you

997
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,020
actually remove the frequency bands so

998
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,509
which

999
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,630
means that you're not supporting LT

1000
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:40,640
based frequencies then obviously what

1001
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,380
happens is like if you're travelling so

1002
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,730
your device would be handed over to 2g

1003
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:47,120
base station because you're obviously

1004
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,760
not supporting LT frequencies then you

1005
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,279
remove the voice over LTE capabilities

1006
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,690
like these are the traditional way this

1007
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,970
is a traditional way like how you make

1008
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,130
noise calls and lt which is much more

1009
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,740
secure than doing on a on a GSM base

1010
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,210
network if you remove like v2x

1011
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,240
capabilities like it's not a card

1012
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:07,070
anymore it's just a normal modem so this

1013
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,430
is one of the trace from one of the

1014
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:11,900
operators and then just to show that the

1015
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,220
security mode command is actually

1016
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,150
happening after the capabilities are

1017
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,609
transferred to the network so we did

1018
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:22,250
some tests on live networks basically

1019
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:24,110
what we see here is like like the voice

1020
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:26,360
calls are denied to the to the phone

1021
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:30,140
then the data rate is killed then the

1022
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,090
handlers are actually being over to the

1023
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,259
2g or 3G networks so basically what

1024
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,610
you're trying here is like in this

1025
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:39,320
you're trying to attach normally like a

1026
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,460
5g or a 4G phone to the network like it

1027
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,850
I were to device so you're actually

1028
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:46,250
killing all its capabilities so we tried

1029
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:49,009
or like 32 networks and then 22 of them

1030
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,690
are actually using this kind of

1031
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,160
configuration where they asked the

1032
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:54,680
capabilities first and then do the

1033
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,230
security so which has to change and the

1034
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,240
the the success for their tag is like

1035
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,950
because these capabilities are saved at

1036
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,319
the network you're not doing the

1037
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,319
retransmission of them so they are being

1038
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,300
used until you make restart so to just

1039
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,820
get over this attacked like the phone

1040
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,130
needs a restart I mean like imagine how

1041
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,720
many of us do a restart of our phone I

1042
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,030
think I did it two months ago or

1043
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,529
something or or automatically when I was

1044
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:22,460
updated I think it did

1045
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:25,880
early started by itself so you might ask

1046
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,920
like okay why is this happening like why

1047
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,720
why is the standard allowing like to to

1048
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,930
do to do this like security transactions

1049
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,160
before security so the the the simple

1050
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:37,100
reason we found in the standards was

1051
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,830
like this is for the optimization of the

1052
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,299
connection but now it's a trade-off like

1053
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,279
what would you choose you would you

1054
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,540
choose this optimization or would you

1055
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,300
before security over this then the third

1056
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,710
one the similar kind of thing so here

1057
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,630
what we try to do is like we try to

1058
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,970
remove the the power saving more

1059
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,130
capabilities of in in naruban our two

1060
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:01,819
devices so basically these devices have

1061
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:04,160
this something called PSM so normally

1062
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,320
these I already wear I like sending few

1063
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,759
kilobytes now and then maybe they did

1064
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,310
they don't have to do anything for the

1065
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,770
next one week like in smart grids or

1066
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,170
smart meters so they actually go off

1067
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,990
with this power saving mode and then

1068
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:20,000
wake up after one week and then do the

1069
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:22,069
transmission of maybe one KB and then

1070
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,960
sleep again so that's how they live for

1071
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,330
10 years so when you remove this kind of

1072
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,670
TSM capabilities from the device you're

1073
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:30,770
actually keeping the device active which

1074
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:34,190
is just draining its battery by doing

1075
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:35,720
signal measurements and everything and

1076
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,480
then you can actually drain the battery

1077
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,100
within like 13 days and you support and

1078
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,700
you expect to run the device for 10

1079
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:46,880
years so and the problem is also same

1080
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:49,520
like because like you need a restart to

1081
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,750
actually recover from this so these are

1082
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,000
some of the three types of attacks we

1083
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,470
actually tried on this side and then on

1084
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,320
the access network protocols then we

1085
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,149
also tried something on locating and

1086
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,640
tracking people based on authentication

1087
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:16,820
protocol messages actually Robbie would

1088
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:18,859
take over this okay so all the attacks

1089
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,020
you mentioned I just give an example of

1090
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,960
what it what it means if we fire up a

1091
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,820
base station here in this room without

1092
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,250
looking at even if your phones are in

1093
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,440
your packet and bag we can tell exactly

1094
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,660
whether this guy is carrying an iPhone

1095
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,370
and which software version is running I

1096
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,770
can tell without looking at his phone or

1097
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:38,930
bag I can also tell he's running let's

1098
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:42,320
assume he's running a Samsung phone with

1099
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:44,629
Android 10 or or or any any version

1100
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,580
without looking at it so it's not like

1101
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,690
I'm really going into his device but at

1102
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,160
least I'm getting some threat

1103
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,500
intelligence by without looking it so

1104
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,779
it's basically this quite important also

1105
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,490
is for we can also get the IOT device

1106
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,140
information so it's basically you get

1107
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,899
some some more information about

1108
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,910
the devices and what he explained the

1109
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:05,030
battery drain attack as well that was

1110
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,620
very important and when we discussed all

1111
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,210
this vulnerability with 3gpp who

1112
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,640
designed the protocol standard and they

1113
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,610
said yeah this makes sense and and then

1114
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,960
we should not ask this information

1115
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,760
without authentication doesn't really

1116
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,680
make sense to request this information

1117
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,120
before this and they fixed those

1118
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,950
vulnerabilities in the standard but this

1119
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,560
will takes until one to two years until

1120
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,839
we will get this in new newer devices so

1121
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,880
it will come but it will come after a

1122
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:31,400
few years so this is one point but this

1123
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,110
is this is important because why we

1124
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,200
started to do this research because in

1125
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,760
in Fiji we have done some improvements

1126
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,220
and what is the improvement I try to

1127
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,190
explain so how many people know MC

1128
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:45,439
cashiers MC catches or stingrays so

1129
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:49,310
basically in Phi G they may not be

1130
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,830
usable at all because in Phi G we will

1131
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:53,390
not use MC in plain Tex so if you fire

1132
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:56,210
up your MC catcher which you've bought

1133
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:58,670
for a million euro or whatever it is

1134
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:00,320
from from any entity or any company and

1135
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,000
if you run this you will not be able to

1136
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,060
capture any Phi G phone because there is

1137
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,500
no MC over there so they will get failed

1138
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,759
as long as there anyone passive mode of

1139
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,740
course even when you make an active

1140
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,690
attack and when you downgrade them to 4G

1141
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,979
and 3G you will listen it right but now

1142
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,190
we're looking at actually what exactly

1143
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:18,140
more can be done boom the protocol side

1144
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,060
and this is a few things so implicature

1145
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,580
works on this first block where they try

1146
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:24,560
to use MC MC means the unique number

1147
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,200
which your SIM card has that identifies

1148
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,900
you as a person or a or a device and

1149
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,700
then there we also had another problem

1150
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,420
with the challenge protocol and this was

1151
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,700
also partly our work in 2012 and this

1152
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,770
was all known problems where Phi G

1153
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,310
people know actually right and when the

1154
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:45,350
protocol was being designed or rethink

1155
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,750
setting 2017 something that time

1156
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,940
discussion was going on and then we went

1157
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,390
to them and they said we found something

1158
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,250
else

1159
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,049
do you want to look at it that this

1160
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,060
could be also problem for Phi G if we

1161
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,340
don't fix it so we still leaving some

1162
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,020
scope that users will be good track and

1163
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,240
what is this exactly so what basically

1164
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,830
we're going to use is a called

1165
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,479
authentication material I will explain

1166
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,370
what is the authentication material

1167
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,020
looks likes and then we use a fourth

1168
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:11,509
step of protocol which is called rings

1169
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,210
is resynchronization attack

1170
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,890
and the first thing is with MC in Phi G

1171
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,570
it has been decided that they will they

1172
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,690
will no longer send him C in plain text

1173
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,310
basically you will have a PKI where you

1174
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:24,349
exchange the session and then you will

1175
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,630
send encrypted MC for user

1176
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:29,270
identification and this has been good

1177
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:32,300
for at least MC caches now what we

1178
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,770
basically do so this is quite

1179
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,380
complicated figure but I explain in

1180
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,390
normal way so let's assume that I turn

1181
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,730
on my mobile phone okay I power on this

1182
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,799
mobile phone what happens that its power

1183
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:45,619
on it asked for the network hey I won't

1184
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,050
do a tenth occasion ok network says ok

1185
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,780
fine you wanted to use our services les

1186
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:53,300
authenticate and it's quite obvious then

1187
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,980
network says okay you want to

1188
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,470
authenticate here I give you a challenge

1189
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,849
because network must authenticate and

1190
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,589
and you know we need to have some kind

1191
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:02,359
of a challenge so challenge consists of

1192
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:04,730
two bits which is called random number

1193
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,130
an authentication token random number is

1194
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:09,650
just a number north indication token

1195
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:11,420
which consists of two values I will come

1196
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:13,609
back to this and this two values comes

1197
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,770
to phone and phones verifies so where

1198
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:17,270
the phone algorithms there are some

1199
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,910
algorithms which are stored on your SIM

1200
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:22,130
card they text those number random

1201
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:24,770
number calculates some computation and

1202
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:26,180
they they use this aut n to create some

1203
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,530
value and they send it back to the

1204
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,899
network saying that this is the

1205
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:31,400
challenge response and check whether

1206
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,990
it's correct or not so network checks

1207
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,630
whether the key response is the same

1208
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,790
what he expects if you say yes ok you

1209
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,890
allow to use services if not he will

1210
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,300
give you error message saying that there

1211
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,790
is a sink failure or there is a mat

1212
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,130
failure so reason because think failure

1213
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,619
is saying that ok I know you're the

1214
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,270
right guy but something is lacking we

1215
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:52,010
are not to synchronize we are we haven't

1216
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:53,990
been synchronized each other well well

1217
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,819
if it's a Mac failure it says that no

1218
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:57,259
this is not you for example so it's

1219
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,029
basically two kind of error message it

1220
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:01,069
gets but what is interesting point is

1221
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:03,950
here basically now so what we basically

1222
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:05,690
used is this is Rand and aut and this is

1223
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,598
again plain text and it's also happens

1224
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,000
in Phi G so your MC is predicted but not

1225
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:13,069
Rand and random number and aut and this

1226
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,900
is still goes plaintext and actually we

1227
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:18,440
use this material to to identify a

1228
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,970
target now in Phi G and how do we use it

1229
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,730
because there is one one thing which is

1230
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,709
missing there or there was one

1231
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,839
mathematical issue

1232
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,599
in the competition of that thing what

1233
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,549
was it exactly so let's assume that the

1234
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,349
first block is basically a one mobile

1235
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,690
phone and second is a different mobile

1236
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:38,079
phone so what happens on the first one

1237
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:41,050
when you get a utn aut n is basically

1238
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,480
consisting of your Mac for example or or

1239
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:46,150
it has been protected with a case so you

1240
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,910
you have a Mac value and this has been

1241
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:51,700
protected with a k a k belongs analytic

1242
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:53,319
key which means that you are sequence

1243
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,299
number what exactly you are using is

1244
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:57,040
being protected with some anonymity key

1245
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,599
so what is the sequence number is

1246
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,300
basically was a game of sequence number

1247
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,550
so it makes sense that mobile phone when

1248
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,260
you authenticate it stores some sequence

1249
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,119
number let's assume that I authenticated

1250
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,680
with mobile network and and my secuence

1251
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,230
number was 1000 okay

1252
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,190
next time if somebody grabbed the same

1253
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,680
random number

1254
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,210
aut n and replayed because he's

1255
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,490
replaying the same sequence number of

1256
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,440
1000 which has been already used by the

1257
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:23,200
SIM card so SIM card says that this is a

1258
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,020
replay attack so it says no I have used

1259
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,149
1000 sequence no longer being used so

1260
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,160
you have to use 1000 1 or 1,000 fighting

1261
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,890
like this so this sequence number gets

1262
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:35,319
incremental e1 1 plus 1 every time and

1263
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,058
the same state from SIM card of your SIM

1264
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,950
card has been stored with mobile network

1265
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,869
operator server so they are always with

1266
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,189
the same level of sequence number so

1267
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:44,170
that's like a game here it's basically

1268
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,359
now what happens with the sequence

1269
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,540
number let's assume that's this one

1270
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:50,920
mobile phone is a sequence numbers 1000

1271
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,990
and this sequence number is protected

1272
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,880
with what you see this value here see

1273
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:57,549
when c1 is equal to a sequence number

1274
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,190
XOR with a k that's anonymity key sk

1275
00:47:57,549 --> 00:48:02,170
star okay and this is the sequence of

1276
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,030
1000 let's assume that this guy made

1277
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,799
thousand calls and he's right now at two

1278
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,559
thousand sequence the same mobile phone

1279
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:10,930
now I replay as a fake base station same

1280
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,369
random number and aut n2 this guy he

1281
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:14,440
will give a riff different response

1282
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:18,040
having sequence number two which is two

1283
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,410
thousand right which is two thousand XOR

1284
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,020
with the same key called a K because

1285
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,970
this a keiki is derived from a random

1286
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,950
number it has no logic of sequence

1287
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,480
number because as an attacker I'm

1288
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,009
playing the same random number to this

1289
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,290
mobile phone he just takes the same

1290
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:36,140
random number and and he used the same

1291
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:39,460
key and if I XOR these two values c1x

1292
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:42,170
see - so basically sequence number one

1293
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,600
XOR sequence number two and actually I

1294
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:47,060
cancel out straight ahead a K and a k

1295
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,980
due to X or properties like a simple

1296
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,540
mathematical or mathematical issues that

1297
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,820
if you XOR those two values you just

1298
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,680
cancel out the K key so basically you

1299
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,540
don't need to compute a keiki you cancel

1300
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,669
it out and you get this sequence number

1301
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,920
and now challenge is I just need to use

1302
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:03,260
I just need to find out what exactly the

1303
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,120
sequence number bits are and we need

1304
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,100
some computation again how do we

1305
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,410
identify a particular sequence number of

1306
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,819
a user and and we came to countries and

1307
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,310
actually sequester number has a unique

1308
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,560
value per user or per SIM card has a

1309
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,820
unique sequence number value so let's

1310
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,310
assume that there is a sequence number

1311
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,400
of 1 0 1 1 which which belongs to

1312
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:24,170
thousand for example which is identified

1313
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,850
only for Altaf and actually his phone

1314
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,640
will be in the same sequence number plus

1315
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,810
1 and when I check for other user the

1316
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,089
same sequence number it has the same

1317
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,980
value so basically even by looking at a

1318
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,660
sequence number I can I can say that

1319
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,030
this is my target or this is my for

1320
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,620
mobile phone actually so in fact you we

1321
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,870
don't need to know know MC but we can

1322
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,330
use this kind of one levity which hasn't

1323
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:46,549
been fixed yet to identify and track

1324
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:48,500
user so no matter where you you go to

1325
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:50,510
any area you just fire up your fake base

1326
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,790
station send the same random number and

1327
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:54,020
aut n and you just know your target ok

1328
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,410
right now this guy is sitting in this

1329
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:59,630
building and we just fire up these

1330
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:02,060
packets from any car or any car for

1331
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,250
example or any psychiatric vehicle and

1332
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:07,009
you just get a response say like this we

1333
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,350
discussed this one deputy to the vendors

1334
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,660
to the designers and they said yeah we

1335
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:14,210
know there's a problem now but now they

1336
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,600
said this is ok but this is a targeted

1337
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:19,280
attack we agree because it's it's not

1338
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,410
easy to fix this problem because we have

1339
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,140
because this is the same protocol

1340
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:26,990
mechanism has been used in 3G 4G and Phi

1341
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,210
G so it's really hard to fix or not not

1342
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,609
easy to fix and it's a targeted targeted

1343
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:33,830
attack so it will affect only few uses

1344
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,570
but not like mask level of users so this

1345
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,029
hasn't been fixed yet but it's on

1346
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,620
ongoing stage for discussion but the

1347
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,000
second vulnerability is fixed what Altaf

1348
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,150
discuss that's all the security

1349
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,320
properties will be asked only know after

1350
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,230
the authentication so this has been

1351
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,250
fixed with mobile vendors and this was

1352
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,970
also

1353
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:54,559
GSMA that's a mobile operators body they

1354
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:56,689
also have the vulnerability disclosure

1355
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,369
program so actually when if you find

1356
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:02,270
anyone everyday of any mobile operator

1357
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:04,430
by playing any tool set like we do so so

1358
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:05,960
they actually listen to your

1359
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,250
vulnerability they interact with mobile

1360
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,539
operators and then they become a one

1361
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,520
channel so it's a it's a good program

1362
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:14,599
started by GSMA - if you are some

1363
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:17,210
findings on this learn and fixes for IOT

1364
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:19,490
devices will also come UE capabilities

1365
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,880
has been protected the capability should

1366
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:26,299
be replayed and this has been addressed

1367
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:28,190
and going back to 5g the overall 5g

1368
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:29,990
Celso radio and core network I tried to

1369
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,730
highlight some part of a core network we

1370
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:33,169
haven't personally done research on core

1371
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:35,299
network because we don't have a platform

1372
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,880
or or something to do research on how

1373
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:39,530
how it will look like right now we do

1374
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,390
have some implementation to play with

1375
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,490
Phi G core network for example if some

1376
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:45,078
great some guys are interested like some

1377
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:46,700
French company called Omari software

1378
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:49,339
they provide you some stack which is not

1379
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:51,049
ready for because the standard for 5g

1380
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,509
core network hasn't been fixed so that's

1381
00:51:51,049 --> 00:51:54,950
what you don't have a public stack where

1382
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,750
you can really play around with how do

1383
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,250
you how this really hypervisor

1384
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:00,380
implementation really works or something

1385
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:02,690
like this or there are not many vendors

1386
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:04,400
who provide something like this so we do

1387
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,720
have a better security in Phi G so far

1388
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,450
at least by looking at the standard what

1389
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,848
we know new features but also increase

1390
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,558
tax surface at the same time legacy

1391
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:14,329
systems are as well there so you still

1392
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,920
have a problem that somebody can ask you

1393
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:18,799
to fall back the 4G networks and you

1394
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,950
still have those attacks and as well we

1395
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:23,390
need to have the best security practices

1396
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,520
when it comes to the configuring cloud

1397
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,440
and my assumption is or at least what we

1398
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,170
say when we have a new technology like

1399
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,240
5g the core network of course it takes

1400
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,619
some time to become mature right when

1401
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,479
you have a new technology it takes time

1402
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:37,609
to be get understand the configuration

1403
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,410
to deploy the services so we may have

1404
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:41,240
some problems in early years with Phi G

1405
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:43,490
Co network as well but time to time it

1406
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,950
make it better the way we follow the

1407
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,959
basic real practices in this and I end

1408
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,328
on this note so there is a report from

1409
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,069
NATO alliance this is the natto

1410
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:53,210
cooperative cyber defence centre of

1411
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:56,569
excellence they have a really nice

1412
00:52:53,210 --> 00:53:00,859
article on the controversy going on Phi

1413
00:52:56,569 --> 00:53:02,900
G security or Phi G Phi G China and

1414
00:53:00,859 --> 00:53:04,940
Hawaii its article name actually

1415
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:07,460
and that has one really nice quote what

1416
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,290
you read there so Phi G as an emergence

1417
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,960
signalling signal Intelligence Platform

1418
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,880
and why it's important this is what I

1419
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,600
told you in after ten years when we use

1420
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:20,210
Phi G for every IOT device every car and

1421
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,180
also Phi G is also planning to use low

1422
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:27,020
low latency it's not a no learn no not

1423
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:28,700
low latency see this Leo satellite so

1424
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,890
they also have a plan to use that also

1425
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,020
access medium for example so so assuming

1426
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,799
that we are going that area so even

1427
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,230
though you have an end-to-end

1428
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:38,630
application security you still leave

1429
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:40,520
some places with telemetry data and the

1430
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:42,500
telemetry data means signaling data so

1431
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,500
that reveals some information about a

1432
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,480
user about the device and what kind of

1433
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,430
applications not the end data but you

1434
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,470
still get the telemetry data so many

1435
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,750
people see Phi G as a threat in in terms

1436
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,430
of that and this is also quite

1437
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:59,680
interesting from surveillance point of

1438
00:53:55,430 --> 00:54:02,060
view for Phi G and on this end I

1439
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,160
conclude our presentation and if you

1440
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:06,430
have any questions we are field to talk

1441
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,430
now

1442
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:19,799
[Applause]

1443
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:23,598
any question I think we do have three

1444
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,599
minutes one or two yeah one or two

1445
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,368
these are actually two questions when

1446
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:40,180
you talk about the hypervisor entrusting

1447
00:54:36,369 --> 00:54:44,230
on the hypervisor does that cause any

1448
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:46,450
change of risk posture on what we're

1449
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:49,869
currently doing on migrating business

1450
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:52,390
processes and data to the cloud because

1451
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:54,160
we're already trusting hypervisors in

1452
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:55,990
the cloud and there's a lot of programs

1453
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,348
doing research on security of

1454
00:54:55,990 --> 00:55:02,828
hypervisors and as you just said that is

1455
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:07,869
being constantly improved and the second

1456
00:55:02,829 --> 00:55:10,240
question is for 5g networks is there any

1457
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:14,410
special consideration that we should

1458
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,970
have in terms of who the vendor should

1459
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:20,828
be and whether somebody should control

1460
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:23,640
like the core part of their 5g network

1461
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:27,099
as opposed to the core part of the 4G

1462
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,990
this goes back to the China thing that

1463
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:32,829
you were just talking about yeah the

1464
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:34,419
first question about hypervisor is is

1465
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,099
true that we are already using that it's

1466
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,859
not really new technology only the

1467
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,579
problem with the deployment deployment

1468
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:42,400
and Trust

1469
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:44,289
so basically when as a mobile operator

1470
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:48,010
when I buy this infrastructure whether I

1471
00:55:44,289 --> 00:55:50,170
build my own data center to install

1472
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,329
those stack or I will just buy from a

1473
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:55,569
vendor and then then it becomes a

1474
00:55:52,329 --> 00:55:57,190
problem of trust right and this is main

1475
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:58,690
challenging with hypervisor and that's

1476
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,779
what the problem is let's assume that I

1477
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:04,630
buy all this core network from from

1478
00:56:01,779 --> 00:56:06,789
China or who I for example write or will

1479
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:09,220
I ask who I to build data center as well

1480
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:11,079
for me or not and then I run all the

1481
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:12,910
stack on this cloud and I provider and

1482
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:15,130
hypervisor it doesn't end the end there

1483
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,328
for example in order to configure all

1484
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:17,710
these settings you need to give a

1485
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:20,200
different access to different entities

1486
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:21,819
right and now how do you maintain the

1487
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,020
trust between different third parties

1488
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:25,630
who are also accessing the same

1489
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,369
hypervisor for for protection for adding

1490
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:29,079
firewalls and many timelines

1491
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,940
anything like this so that becomes the

1492
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:32,829
trust issue now how do you really manage

1493
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:34,359
the trust that's that's the biggest

1494
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:36,250
problem for mobile operator because

1495
00:56:34,359 --> 00:56:37,538
right now with mobile operators until 4G

1496
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,569
they have the full control over the

1497
00:56:37,539 --> 00:56:41,829
system right and and this may shift some

1498
00:56:40,569 --> 00:56:43,990
change here and there again some

1499
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:45,670
operators will really do

1500
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:48,009
statistically or if they have resources

1501
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,630
they can do but some operators will just

1502
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,950
rely on the vendor so just give me

1503
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,510
everything and I will just use the

1504
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,129
whatever you gave me because they don't

1505
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,960
have the manpower or resources to build

1506
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,869
their own infrastructure for example

1507
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,310
like a cloud each cloud or something RS

1508
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:02,070
and the second point is it's quite

1509
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,779
controversial again is depending on the

1510
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:07,500
policy of organization how they do it

1511
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,640
but as many people say multi-vendor

1512
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,280
deployment is the best strategy what

1513
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,049
this is and that has been mentioned by

1514
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,790
the UK government as well and some

1515
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:17,800
government also planning similarly like

1516
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:19,720
for example you buy a core network from

1517
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,180
a trusted entity which you trust most

1518
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,250
for example of one vendor but you can

1519
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,540
also take some base stations from some

1520
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,250
other vendors some from other vendors

1521
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,810
you just have a diversity of your

1522
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:32,020
network so you don't rely on one vendor

1523
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:33,310
for everything and statistically you you

1524
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:36,009
build your blocks where you have a

1525
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:38,259
control over the some blocks it's like a

1526
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,770
strategy of the way you do it but again

1527
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:43,710
this is complicated because Ericsson not

1528
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:46,300
a hundred percent all the Erickson's

1529
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,980
software and hardware will speak to the

1530
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,900
huai software because every everybody

1531
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,190
has a different specification so by

1532
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,050
standard it doesn't really work

1533
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:54,790
flawlessly so you still have some

1534
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,050
caveats there here and there so there

1535
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,310
are some pains for operators when you

1536
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:02,500
use multi vendor but those has to be

1537
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:06,620
reduced for example yeah

1538
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:08,930
okay so we have a leak of time okay all

1539
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:12,660
right so guys thank you for incredible

1540
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:17,989
speech okay and yeah

1541
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,989
[Applause]
