140
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,439
what's exactly going on here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to</font>

141
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,229
kind of touch on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this briefly the web</font>

142
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,400
two point O landscape really the key

143
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,949
thing here is you have a much richer

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,469
client you know here I'll put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

145
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:13,090
so web web one point out stuff very much

146
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:14,830
was very simple client-server apps you

147
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,150
know you'd go ahead you'd have you know

148
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,590
everything actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on the</font>

149
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,068
server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your browser was simply a</font>

150
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:22,810
dumb terminal<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right excellent so</font>

151
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:24,039
your browser was just a dumb terminal to

152
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,060
connect you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this web server</font>

153
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,590
application now the when we went to Wed

154
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,000
to point o what we really did is say you

155
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,948
know what we can have a much richer

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,680
experience if we push a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

157
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this application to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser in the</font>

158
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,779
form of say JavaScript or<font color="#CCCCCC"> be god forbid</font>

159
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,460
silverlight or flash or something like

160
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,229
that so we're actually going to push

161
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,729
part of the application to the client so

162
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:47,258
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they can get instantaneous</font>

163
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,270
feedback we can have a much richer

164
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,430
experience as opposed to say if you're

165
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,349
using you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> classic</font>

166
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">example is mapquest in the late 90s</font>

167
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,719
horrible experience you'd say let me go

168
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,460
what East you'd wait three seconds you

169
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,169
get your page back it was just you know

170
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,409
something more interactive<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Google</font>

171
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,508
Maps so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this talk what I want</font>

172
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:09,669
to do is focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the client itself</font>

173
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,830
because instead of being a dumb terminal

174
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,448
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added a little bit more and we keep</font>

175
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,889
adding a little bit more in a little bit

176
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,479
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like pearl you keep getting</font>

177
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit more from Sipan until you</font>

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,979
end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this monstrosity so the</font>

179
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,919
thing we're starting to see now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

180
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,599
idea of offline applications and kind of

181
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way these things work is and I know</font>

182
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,449
this is a black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and white I pulled this</font>

183
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,940
out of a actually I've got some sexy

184
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,060
flash stuff at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is</font>

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,680
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an image in in our in the</font>

186
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,389
book<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wrote called Ajax security</font>

187
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,370
of the guy named Brian Sullivan so you

188
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:44,529
have this ID of the UI that you're

189
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,849
interfacing with and then behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

190
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,500
scenes officially going to have a data

191
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,620
switch and says all right if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

192
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">server if i'm not online let's go ahead</font>

193
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,310
run through another abstraction layer

194
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,289
and somehow store it in a client-side

195
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,710
database inside of the web browser and

196
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,870
then

197
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:01,450
when i connect it will transparently

198
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,400
resync it you know kind of everything

199
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,320
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and kind of</font>

200
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,969
went to point o apses<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah i love</font>

201
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,909
gmail what happens when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a plane</font>

202
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,010
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get on a plane a lot and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it sucks</font>

203
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,600
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you know</font>

204
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,070
without look I can go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

205
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,960
compose messages look through what I've

206
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,670
got update my address book all sorts of

207
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,650
stuff with gmail nothing I'm on the

208
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,150
plane it's a web application but if

209
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,489
unless I'm connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web I can't</font>

210
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,130
do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an idea</font>

211
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,890
of what I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go offline I can go</font>

212
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,350
ahead and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it store my inbox on the</font>

213
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:35,069
clients in a database or maybe store the

214
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:38,260
most recent messages i sent maybe store

215
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,520
my most important contacts this is

216
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,159
actually kind of cool from a computer

217
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,090
science perspective because it's like

218
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,790
programmatically how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

219
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,560
what the most important things are so i

220
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,390
can cash them locally so that when

221
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,979
they're not connected they can still do

222
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,110
meaningful things and then when we

223
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,910
reconnect just like when i get<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the</font>

224
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:56,710
plane without look and i plug it back in

225
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,920
it sends everything that's in my outbox

226
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,240
all that type of stuff so you know that

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,770
at the end result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're talking</font>

228
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell the</font>

229
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,250
difference between when you're connected

230
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:09,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a the web application or you're</font>

231
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:13,630
working offline you know let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me repeat</font>

232
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:16,270
this again let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again don't</font>

233
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind me I've been drinking you know</font>

234
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:21,340
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put so much of the web</font>

235
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,990
application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the clients</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are</font>

236
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,090
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do meaningful things when we're</font>

237
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,250
not even connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web well</font>

238
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,320
content to the web are you kidding me I

239
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,840
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one rule of web security</font>

240
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,100
is you cannot trust the clients perfect

241
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,630
example of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> rob was showing he's</font>

242
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,100
like I'm gonna do various encoding

243
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,780
techniques things like that and try to

244
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,790
get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server and it was a</font>

245
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers job to canonicalize eyes</font>

246
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,380
everything to say okay is this you know

247
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,850
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths with their full</font>

248
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,800
width unicode what are they doing

249
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,710
actually get through and send a text to

250
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,930
me so this idea that wait a minute no no

251
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,690
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a lot of the browser</font>

252
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,829
actually play a role in the application

253
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,650
and we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have javascript and</font>

254
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,730
flash and everything else in here

255
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,640
anybody who does anything with security

256
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,950
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately be scared by this so</font>

257
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,110
kind of the way they accomplish this is

258
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,480
really three things one you need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

259
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,820
rich client side programming

260
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,050
language now<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally javascript is used</font>

261
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,790
that will see a little later in the

262
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation you can use flash you can</font>

263
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">use pretty much anything you want now</font>

264
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,240
the other thing well to other things

265
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,510
you're going to need is one is a local

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,399
cache for web documents so in Google

267
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,260
gears which is an offline Ajax

268
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,300
application framework that's built into

269
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google Chrome or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's accessible as a</font>

270
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,620
plug-in to the other browsers they call

271
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,899
this a local store anybody here familiar

272
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the html5 spec it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like the</font>

273
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,220
next generation of HTML it has this

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">built in both of these things are in the</font>

275
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,760
spec so when he browser that does html5

276
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,820
is going to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

277
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,610
client-side cache of web documents and a

278
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,709
client-side database so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

279
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,740
basically when you're not connected but

280
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,719
I click on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a take me to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inbox the</font>

281
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,970
images the JavaScript the cascading

282
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,100
style sheets HTML those are actually

283
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,899
cached on my local system so instead of

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">making a request all the way to the web</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulls it from my cash now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

287
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,600
here to remember and I'll go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

288
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,120
a little bit more detail is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,470
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than your browser cache a lot</font>

291
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,130
let's say you've been I don't know using

292
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,810
a company machine to look at you porn

293
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,250
while you're on a long business trip and

294
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to clear out all that nasty</font>

cache this is a different cash than that

298
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,180
that cash is there purely for

299
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:37,240
performance this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache is actually there</font>

300
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,859
as a manifest of offline documents that

301
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,529
you're going to be accessing when you're

302
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">not actually connected to the Internet</font>

303
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,579
the second part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

304
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:47,109
a client-side database I need a I don't

305
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,699
really care<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this takes whether it's</font>

306
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,100
a database or whether it's a giant hash

307
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:53,800
table but I need a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saying here's</font>

308
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,920
some data and here's a name store this

309
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,969
and later I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> retrieve it so</font>

310
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,550
we'll talk a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

311
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,170
in a moment so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

312
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,399
because I get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

313
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know if you guys have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen me talk</font>

314
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,360
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know javascript is kind of</font>

315
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:10,329
something I play a lot with and

316
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,920
hopefully I've been able to express to

317
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,540
you that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

318
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,069
makes the gerbils dance and gives you

319
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,199
little mouse trails and all the annoying

320
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:19,750
crap on the web it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually extremely</font>

321
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,660
powerful it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> object based language</font>

322
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,699
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has very powerful native features</font>

323
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's object and array models are very</font>

324
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:29,349
very rich it has native reg<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's other</font>

325
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,170
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so it's not just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply</font>

326
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,019
a toy scripting language um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

327
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">can redefine JavaScript code at runtime</font>

328
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:39,550
I believe I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example last year</font>

329
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">read nothing but white space so we get</font>

330
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">past your ID or your IDs or IPs and it</font>

331
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,040
it basically rehydrated itself to

332
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,680
full-blown malware code once it got

333
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,910
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so yeah I was pretty sexy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

334
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I gave I don't want to give the</font>

335
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,560
demonstration again but I guess like I

336
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,439
could if you wanted to see it too it is

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,430
pretty sexy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took Weiss I'll tell you</font>

338
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,939
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I think it's pretty</font>

339
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">sexy um it basically took malware it</font>

340
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:09,430
took any type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript and</font>

341
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,620
basically took it first converted it

342
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,229
just to bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all JavaScript can</font>

343
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,629
be represented by 7-bit ascii even

344
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,089
though the like say the strings and

345
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,800
stuff inside of it can be unicode you

346
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,839
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keywords and the function</font>

347
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">names</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's all 7-bit ascii so i</font>

348
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,560
would take a character in<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript say</font>

349
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:33,040
a convert it to binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven bits so 01</font>

350
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,888
what capital a is 65 in ascii so well

351
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,180
anyway do the math so I converted it to

352
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,490
this and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

353
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,870
bit stream of what this looks like every

354
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,089
time I see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to put a</font>

355
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,790
space every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I see a 1 i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

356
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,100
put a tab when you hit the new line I'm

357
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,199
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so literally alert would be</font>

358
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,050
translated<font color="#CCCCCC"> into like space tabs bass</font>

359
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,269
bass bass tabs bass tab tab tab nothing

360
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,819
but white space and it would be between

361
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">2 HTML comments and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then what happened</font>

362
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:02,259
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript would just say hey</font>

363
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,519
that's between this comment in this

364
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,740
comment where it just looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

365
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,350
space fetch that for me and let me

366
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,180
convert it back into ascii code and then

367
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,130
use the eval function to execute so you

368
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,800
actually can redefine and execute this

369
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,959
stuff at runtime I and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> bears</font>

370
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,878
repeating no you literally you call a

371
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,229
function once it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you call</font>

372
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,779
the function again it does something

373
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,300
completely different um you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

374
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">override system functions so there was a</font>

375
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,439
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sexy attack does everybody here</font>

376
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,850
know what a constructor is inside when

377
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:32,290
you're programming or whatever some of

378
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,630
you all right you actually can redefine

379
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,040
constructors

380
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,689
run times you could say all right

381
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,280
normally when someone construction<font color="#E5E5E5"> ray</font>

382
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,720
they call this function now when

383
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,939
somebody tries to constructor array

384
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,470
they're gonna call my constructor which

385
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,930
is evil and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sniff</font>

386
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,600
everything you give it so it's it's a

387
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,579
really crazy language it's extremely

388
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,590
powerful in its networking functionality

389
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,240
so it doesn't have native networking

390
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,830
functionality but javascript is embedded

391
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,560
inside the browser so you're talking

392
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about xmlhttprequest which is the basis</font>

393
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ajax you're talking about I can talk</font>

394
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a flash object which can do raw</font>

395
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,030
sockets it can cross the same domain

396
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,790
policy different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

397
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,829
there's also some models of threading in

398
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript and in the implementations</font>

399
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,330
and we see you know with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Google Chrome with their v8 engine we</font>

just focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on making this stuff run</font>

405

as fast as<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible so it's powerful</font>

406
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,280
people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this run</font>

407
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,870
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

408
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,160
necessarily understand the nuances of it

409
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,530
and they still kind of have this very

410
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,569
late 90s view that okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

411
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,670
kind of some little toy language that

412
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,430
people use to make stupid animations on

413
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,620
there you know Gio cities page which I

414
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,699
just on a side note I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's funny</font>

415
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,170
because back in the day when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font>

416
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting into the web like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> geo cities</font>

417
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,979
with my day right like 90 94 95 96 and

418
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,050
now like everything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hated about</font>

419
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,720
the internet back in the day like<font color="#E5E5E5"> purple</font>

420
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,670
animated gif backgrounds with black text

00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,380
on top of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just go to myspace and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you see the same thing so it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shows</font>

423
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you know a generation later a decade</font>

424
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,700
later exactly you still have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 14</font>

425
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,220
year old to you no want to talk about

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">how nobody understands them with you</font>

427
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,670
know flashing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever animated</font>

428
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,170
backgrounds and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh part of me I</font>

429
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,520
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think somewhere Tim berners-lee</font>

430
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,829
wishes he could take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all back</font>

431
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also like to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

432
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,310
punch a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the face be</font>

433
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,900
like it's a document layout language

434
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:35,810
what the are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

435
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:37,490
this so local cache of web documents so

436
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,020
all right as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is different</font>

437
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">than your browser cache it basically</font>

438
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a manifest so you visit a web</font>

439
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,949
page and that web page through say like

440
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,110
a link tag in the head of the document

441
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,390
will say hey here's the manifest for

442
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,300
accessing this page online offline now

443
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,490
the manifest looks a lot like a jar file

444
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,530
jar files are Java they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

445
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,760
zip file with a manifest inside of them

446
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,500
that basically says things like hey

447
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,150
here's the class you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should learn same</font>

448
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,770
thing with this this is has a manifest

449
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,270
it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here are all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

450
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,760
documents i want you to fetch I want you

451
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,069
to fetch this HTML document fitch this

452
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript document these images so that</font>

453
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,419
way you can access them offline now the

454
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,760
browser just fetches this stuff and

455
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,620
stores it now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is it's</font>

456
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,410
transparently accent so if I suddenly

457
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,429
turn off network connecting and you know

458
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,470
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you've seen this in your</font>

459
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,450
browser if you go under file say in a

460
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,310
work offline and that'll be checked if

461
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,960
you're in say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox there's an</font>

462
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,020
equivalent thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know exactly</font>

463
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,640
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says in IE that happens when the</font>

464
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,980
browser tries to access the network

465
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,560
can't it toggles it automatically into

466
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,360
offline mode now one of the things html5

467
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,690
tries to do is standardized amongst<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

468
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">browsers how the browser tells the web</font>

469
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,710
page are currently on or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

470
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,610
you're currently executing that it's now

471
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,170
an offline mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla WebKit some of</font>

472
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,209
these are guys just have navigator dot

473
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,820
offline and you can query this property

474
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,500
like a boolean so this information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

475
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,240
programming or programmatically

476
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,950
accessible so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript of the</font>

477
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,380
flash can figure out ok here's what I'm

478
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,300
dealing with I now in offline mode so

479
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,640
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of making a fetch you know to</font>

480
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,560
say compose this email and try to send

481
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to gmail but actually you need to do</font>

482
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,929
stick this<font color="#E5E5E5"> into client-side database so</font>

483
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,580
a couple of things like I said Google

484
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:24,020
gears provide some of this offline

485
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,240
capabilities html5<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's here's the scary</font>

486
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,430
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 is it's not</font>

487
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,570
standardized yet but already the

488
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">browser's are implementing various</font>

489
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:34,540
features of it so firefox 3 already has

490
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,550
html5 stuff in it

491
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,139
already has the ability to tell when

492
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,629
you're offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> it already has the</font>

493
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,490
ability to use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things called</font>

494
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,050
global storage incessant storage which

495
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,760
actually i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about here but</font>

496
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a component I Firefox 31 has all the</font>

497
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,570
stuff I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in now the</font>

498
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,950
scary thing is it's built in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

499
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,379
gears at least present you with this

500
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">dialog a Google Chrome which has Google</font>

501
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,190
gears built into it this offline

502
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,910
framework presents you essentially this

503
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,250
diagram or this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> dialog now you'll</font>

504
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">notice here is that Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gear security</font>

509
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:21,400
something on dub dub dub facebook com is

510
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,380
trying to access Google gears who do

511
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,950
offline storage do you want to allow

512
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,110
this yes or no as anybody who knows

513
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,300
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about the history of the</font>

514
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:35,070
web and security asking users to make

515
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">security decisions is a bad decision</font>

516
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,129
because you know as my mom wants to say

517
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,870
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the funny</font>

520
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,420
popped up it's an activex you should

521
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,640
never never never do this do you want to

522
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,830
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> if she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks yes um actually</font>

523
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISS used to run they had a great</font>

524
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,520
marketing campaign many many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

525
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,840
where they said you know you've locked

526
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,190
down your firewall as you've got all

527
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,980
this stuff blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah but are you</font>

528
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sally in accounting and it was</font>

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,070
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how there's always somebody inside</font>

530
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,100
of any organization when they receive an

531
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,899
email that says this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exe they</font>

532
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,240
execute it they you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

533
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,990
people who fall for the Nigerian 409 or

534
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,150
419 scams right so asking Sally and

535
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,670
accounting do you want to do this is a

536
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,880
bad choice now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets worse because</font>

537
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,580
Google gears at least does this what

538
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,810
happens is is that html5 doesn't really

539
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,949
make recommendations about how you

540
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,960
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it so all the browser's</font>

541
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,230
present this differently now a problem

542
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5 you'll notice is that you</font>

543
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,930
have some control over the this dialog

544
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,929
it presents just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like activex activex</font>

545
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,460
used to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a program from and</font>

546
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,080
it was supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the domain name</font>

547
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can basically fill out in your</font>

548
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,080
activex control why don't want

549
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,289
to display and of course people would

550
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,299
display click<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes to download my sexy</font>

551
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,220
weatherbug you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever to give you</font>

552
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:55,989
weather updates and so they would they

553
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,730
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> control essentially the security</font>

554
00:20:55,989 --> 00:21:00,009
dialogue well this right here is the fav

555
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,779
icon and this right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the title</font>

556
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">the webpage you're visiting so I have</font>

557
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:06,940
seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wild attacks where people</font>

558
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:10,209
are using a domain where the fav icon is

559
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,489
a lock and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title of the webpage is</font>

560
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,379
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is perfectly sure secure</font>

561
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:17,739
click yes to do this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

562
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:19,570
that it's over<font color="#CCCCCC"> so people are like allow</font>

563

another application without the

587
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:16,989
applications consent so having just host

port and scheme as your security model

hosting it's all it's all in the same

592
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:35,350
place no they weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stupid so how</font>

593
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:38,109
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you attack local cache well consider</font>

594
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,029
something like apps top social net and

595
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:42,369
apps on social but neck I've got safe

596
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:44,109
app and evil app they both

597
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:46,779
programmatically through<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript can</font>

598
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:49,359
talk to this same logical cash so that

599
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:51,279
safe app can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when they're not</font>

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,380
you have to work when it's offline the

603
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,060
problem is is that the evil app because

604
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,270
its host port and skiing there sir from

605

packing the website and putting up

665

political messages isn't as sexy as

666
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,250
hacking the website and stealing data

667
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,500

672
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,129
and take data from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but attackers have</font>

673
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,889
moved on<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Rob talked about his talk</font>

677
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,000
orange and squeezing it until all the

678
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,580
juice is gone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just moving on that's</font>

679
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,710
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web server is a platform I</font>

680
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,149
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack other people so i'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use things like any pack you</font>

682
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,690

683
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromise the web server</font>

684
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,950
and use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a platform to attack other</font>

685
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:18,780
people well same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing why would i just</font>

686
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal data when I can attack</font>

687
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:25,110
other people so in this case we're going

688
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,870
to smash that local document cash for

689
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,520
fun and profit so inside of evil apps

690
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,260
code what we're going to do is we're

691
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,879
going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay same thing as before</font>

we're going to Stan she ate we're going

693
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,380
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up an access their local data</font>

694
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,870
storage this is the same way you're able

695
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,030
to steal the data but instead of

696
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,370
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal the data we're</font>

697
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,990
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> replacing the data so</font>

698
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,689
that when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline and you're</font>

699
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:51,000
using this Ajax program maybe this email

700
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,530
program instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the programming</font>

701
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,140
logic you're supposed to be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

702
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:56,430
actually able to inject code in this

703
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,160
case what I'm going to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'ma say so</font>

704
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,260
this isn't Eva's evil you visit it says

705
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay first of all why do you do is</font>

706
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,560
capture the document Thank inbox HTML

707
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,169
from the EVAs evil app then I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

708
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,970
to remove doc doc go down directory go

709
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,669
into the safe app and remove from the

710
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,970
document storage their inbox and then I

711
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:21,340
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to copy the document i</font>

712
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,740
downloaded into their document store so

713
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,020
I now replaced their documents and I

714
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:29,559
have renamed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inbox so that when i'm</font>

715
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:32,110
using essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> this ajax mail offline</font>

716
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,940
program and they visit say indexed on

717
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,000
HTML to try to manipulate the current

718
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,919
messages what they're actually doing so

719
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,110
go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> smash the cash what they</font>

720
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,450
actually do is see that all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

721
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:45,370
things here I've now been modified you

722
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,260
think you're just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ajax mail but</font>

723
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,110
another program was able to compromise

724
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,210
the application store that this thing is

725
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:55,418
using when it's offline so now instead

726
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:59,530
of you know my my good friend John

727
00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:01,210
Terrell lamenting where did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go this</font>

728
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually the scientific name for</font>

729
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,900
crabs instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lamenting about the</font>

730
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:10,870
fact that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has crabs it now says dude</font>

731
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,730
I'm clean you know Jill<font color="#CCCCCC"> is telling me</font>

732
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a pig I'm taking the cats and</font>

733
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,380
going to my mother's you know you see

734
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,520
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these thing and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> II put</font>

735
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice little thing and says you've</font>

736
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,320
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just HTML</font>

737
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:29,350
think about if I actually inject

738
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:31,809
JavaScript so I'm yeah go ahead correct

739
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,699
correct that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point so what I'm</font>

740
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:36,340
doing is I'm essentially polluting the

741
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,340
cash that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're got the documents</font>

742
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">store that the Ajax application is going</font>

743
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,809
to use the HX mail app is going to use

744
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,090
when they're offline so when they're

745
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:47,440
online I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to necessarily taint</font>

746
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,990
it I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use another type of</font>

747
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,340
poisoning mechanism like DNS cache

748
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,260
poisoning different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

749
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,689
this is essentially taking the idea of

750
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,929
network cache poisoning and moving it to

751
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:02,880
the clients through this idea of offline

752
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:04,960
applications does that make sense cool

753
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go ahead and I can actually</font>

754
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,039
clobber and inject in so instead of

755
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,730
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change maybe the HTML I'm</font>

756
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

757
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,390
change the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript that's</font>

758
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:18,179
going to be used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program when</font>

759
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:21,039
it's offline now<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cache poisoning</font>

760
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:22,929
cache poisoning is boring to me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

761
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,850
nearly as sexy is actually attacking

762
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,260
better data and

763
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,879
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember the document storage</font>

764
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,379
isn't going to have that much

765
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,060
interesting stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's going to</font>

766
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,790
have application logic right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the form</font>

767
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,620
of dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> J's files maybe some CSS things</font>

768
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,540
like that but what I really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

769
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:41,669
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is this client side database</font>

770
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,670
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what the app is using</font>

771
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,960
all the way back up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when it's</font>

772
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,190
offline and it's saying oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

773
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,810
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server will stick it all</font>

774
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,990
in this database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm done</font>

775
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's resync</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can I</font>

776
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,680
stick in this database to attack the

777
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,310
user while they're using it and maybe

778
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,020
the authentication and input validation

779
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,850
issues that are done<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm directly</font>

780
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,770
through the server maybe those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

781
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:08,050
as maybe those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are better than what's</font>

782
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,520
done by the sinking engine so maybe the

783
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,379
sinking engine is contacting different

784
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,270
web services so if i hack the web app

785
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,850
when it was online mode of would it work

786
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,440
but if I'm offline I poco wishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap in</font>

787
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,270
my database and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reconnect the</font>

788
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:25,230
sink maybe that's a better way to hack

789
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,230
the app yeah

790
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
sure

791
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:44,549
good question i'm actually not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

792
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:46,019
would think that it would resync it the

793
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:47,519
it would doubt because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

794
00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">visit the page and say oh I've got a new</font>

795
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,639
manifest now there might be something

796
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like time date stamps on the</font>

797
00:30:50,639 --> 00:30:56,339
manifest file like like the browser

798
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,639
might say hey I might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this</font>

799
00:30:56,339 --> 00:31:01,320
app this app offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> again let me make a</font>

800
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:04,139
request to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server basically like</font>

801
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,789
a conditional get and say hey manifest

802
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:08,639
have you been modified the version<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

803
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:10,769
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this date and so it's possible</font>

804
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:18,238
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wouldn't get clobbered that's a</font>

805
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:20,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">good question the me yes it is but what</font>

806
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:21,959
happened is is that the evil app can act

807
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:23,729
so the manifest basically for the good

808
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:26,669
app says here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to store</font>

809
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:28,589
locally and so the evil app is going to

810
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:30,899
say I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify what</font>

811
00:31:28,589 --> 00:31:32,820
you stored locally so that when I Reese

812
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:34,799
when the the next time I visit the page

813
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,689
my browser might say hey here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

814
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,549
files i have my offline manifest is that

815
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the web server would be like</font>

816
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:45,059
yes the time/date stamp hasn't modified

817
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,950
on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> No nah there's no signing or</font>

818
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:50,178
check something yeah now you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

819
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,179
to see what a bad idea this is

820
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:03,750
yes also you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might want to name your</font>

821
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,220
datastore something interesting and

822
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,290
unique so in this case the the safe code

823
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,700
app went ahead and just they actually

824
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,309
defined in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript we're going</font>

825
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,080
to call it this and so all the attacker

826
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eve when she was setting up this attack</font>

827
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,120
vector simply had to use the Ajax mail

828
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,090
app and say oh well they're always using

829
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,219
the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe app dash cash so in my app</font>

830
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,320
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to access that data store if</font>

831
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,390
the name was unique because basically

832
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,850
there isn't a way for Java for you to

833
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,470
say hey give me a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the data</font>

834
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,030
stores associated with this domain it's

835
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,150
like a hash table you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know the</font>

836
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:42,780
name so if they for example maybe took

837
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,490
the username and md5 to that and use

838
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,690
that as the store name that would

839
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:52,429
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better because it's not</font>

840
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:52,429
predictable well hopefully assaulted md5

841
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,909
actually another pain for a question

842
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,020
yeah well it is also and I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

843
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,200
this later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to understand</font>

844
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,240
most web developers are not programmers

845
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,580
they didn't come into this new program

846
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,559
the barriers to Wed program or to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

847
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,419
a web developer or non-existent today

848
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,070
right so for me to be an app developer

849
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,370
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need well I pretty much need</font>

850
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,870
visual studio which is expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

851
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,178
mean if I'm doing traditional Windows

852
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,320
client server desktop development I'm

853
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need this type of stuff I'm</font>

854
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,050
going to need debuggers I'm going to

855
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:28,320
need all this crap what do I knee if I'm

856
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:31,950
doing web development Eclipse free I

857
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,500
could do it notepad if I wanted PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

858
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,120
the lamp stack the barriers of entry are

859
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,040
so low you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't really</font>

860
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what they're doing able to get into</font>

861
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">this very quickly and what's worse is</font>

862
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,570
 evaluations of Twitter for what

863
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:48,179
was it like 250 million dollars are you

864

<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding me you know it's driving</font>

865
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,690
people who they basically are seeing

866
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,639
blood in the water and they're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

867

something another guy who sucks a lot

881
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:47,668
yeah new graphics sure uh well the only

882
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,710
thing they can do is manipulate what's

883
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,389
already there so by a pop-up window i'm

884
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,449
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to manipulate say a</font>

885
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,429
browsers if i use a javascript like to

886
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:58,169
confirm or the alert box would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

887
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change them but if i pop up window</font>

888
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,820
you mean like window open with this HTML

889
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,279
file and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got like an image that</font>

890
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,820
uses this they could control<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

891
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about the check box oh oh oh yes</font>

892
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:14,460
you changed the graphics between the two

893
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,170
states that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

894
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,730
think so i think what happens when that

895
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,620
save dialog pops up is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know</font>

896
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a really good question</font>

897
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:31,500
superimposing a picture over like a

898
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,270
clickjacking that no no he's talking

899
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:36,090
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D Sigma he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

900
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,310
this the security dialog that pops up so

901
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:41,010
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great example</font>

902
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,360
it shows the fact that html5 really

903
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:45,360
should address how this information

904
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:47,670
should be presented to the user so good

905
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,650
gears i'm pretty sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you visit a page</font>

906
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,240
and it wants to present this and so it

907
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:53,760
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the current page i'm looking at</font>

908
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,810
let me grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fav icon for it so they</font>

909
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,470
might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been that might just</font>

910
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally be / faved fav icon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SEO or</font>

911
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,770
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something that's specified</font>

912
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,020
maybe through a link tag in the end of

913
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,200
the current document i'm looking at I

914
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:08,300
don't know I'm gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn</font>

915
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,669
if you couldn't change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link state</font>

916
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,609
you still be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view the state of</font>

917
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:15,920
the window correct but this is a browser

918
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:17,390
dialogue it's not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a control so</font>

919
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,130
JavaScript could not put something on

920
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:25,129
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for for web browsers browser</font>

921
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,869
generated dialogues have the highest Z

922
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,849
value so you can't put anything on top

923
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:33,589
of them you can with with this

924
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:34,910
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I can go ahead and throw</font>

925
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,320
something up here on this there was

926
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,049
actually a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good talk at UM at</font>

927
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,490
shmoocon actually I believe no I'm sorry

928
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,130
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was black hat federal where</font>

929
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:44,439
a guy named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moxie was talking about all</font>

930
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different ways you can screw with</font>

931
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,790
SSL and the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is you in you</font>

932
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,160
hijack it before it becomes SSL and use

933
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,960
things like fav icons that are locks and

934
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,190
stuff like that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make them think it's</font>

935
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:02,750
ssl which is a pretty sexy hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

936
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,000
let's focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the client-side database</font>

937
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:07,190
now when I so I was in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

938
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,819
writing my ajax but gears came out in

939
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle of 2007 like middle of summer</font>

940
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:16,730
was like june or july and just this past

941
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,619
summer in 2008 they<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the name to</font>

942
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,640
just be gears but when they came out

943
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,050
with this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

944
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,549
client-side database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

945
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you from javascript I'm like hell</font>

946
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:26,329
yeah this is awesome more stuff I can

947
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,710
exploit from from my cross-site

948
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:29,030
scripting attacks because remember

949
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,470
cross-site scripting is just about

950
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:36,380
popping alert boxes and stealing cookies

951
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,819
so you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client-side</font>

952
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,890
database that you're allowed access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

953
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:41,540
it's a sequel like database now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

954
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,940
heard of sequel light but I hadn't

955
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:45,980
really dug into it sequel light is

956
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,270
really who here has ever messed or

957
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,720
played with sequel light by chance

958
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:53,000
alright so in yeah so sequel light is

959
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,640
basically a way most of the time

960
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,800
databases are nasty and complicated like

961
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,190
a database server you have a client

962
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't like look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mysql you have mysqld</font>

963
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,300
at the damen that's running when you

964
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,660
create new tables it throws all this

965
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:11,000
 / VAR whatever I I forget where the

966
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,580
files actually are there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

967
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">crap you have to sync it</font>

968
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">equal light is very basic it's</font>

969
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,240
essentially a database it's essentially

970
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a data Bach there a database in a file</font>

971
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,160
and now sequel light it supports sequel

972
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,810
statement so select inserts the leads

973
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,850
all that great stuff it's got tables you

974
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:32,570
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create indexes believe the newest</font>

975
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:34,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">version has transactions now there are</font>

976
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">some interesting commands now basically</font>

977
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,760
when you're using sequel like you say

978
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,589
hey my database is located in this file

979
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,450
and you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use a sequel</font>

980
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:44,660
command called attached to say hey I

981
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:47,810
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from this file so you</font>

982
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,089
could say attached to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> C colon</font>

983
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">slash documents and settings admin</font>

984
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,800
whatever so needless<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say they removed</font>

985
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:56,390
the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sequel light that</font>

986
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,490
are in these offline frameworks and

987
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,720
remember there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

988
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,149
you probably haven't really heard of

989
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,500
this but Google Chrome has this gears as

990
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:08,330
a plug-in that works on most browsers I

991
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,370
are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gmail just announced the</font>

992
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,580
way they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing offline email reading</font>

993
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:16,880

994
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:19,009
and WebKit use HD these aspects of<font color="#E5E5E5"> html5</font>

995
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,630
so chances are most of you are running a

996
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:23,330
device that does this right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

997
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,250
just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it so they remove the</font>

998
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,110
dangerous command so JavaScript can't

say hey yeah I want to attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,200
stuff like this so Google and the html5

<font color="#E5E5E5">guys did a pretty good idea of neutering</font>

1008
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,480

1009

native will call them features of sequel

1010

light still make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very dangerous well</font>

1011
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,400
not dangerous rather it makes it very

<font color="#E5E5E5">easy for attackers perfect example once</font>

you want some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other browsers will</font>

1019
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,529
do 5 10 megs per domain but you know

1020
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,058
this isn't you know the late 90s we're

1021
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:20,099
getting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub-domain was a pain in the</font>

1022
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,250
ass you can have infinite subdomains if

1023
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,049
you want so there are very easy denial

1024
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,460
of service attacks where<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript just</font>

suddenly it's consuming like 350 megs of

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,539
whether somebody's doing something nasty

00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,009
or they're just really bad programmers

1045

<font color="#CCCCCC">but that seems like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a web</font>

1057
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,630
a lot of truth to that but apparently we

1058
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,480
we put as much bloat in as there are

1059

some other interesting facts now anybody

00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,089
here actually do a fair bit with

databases at all or any by the day faces

1064
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:57,119
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> with databases it's all</font>

1065
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,700
about when you're creating the tables

what data type is it is it a VAR char is

it a char how long is it is an integer

is it a but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the data types are</font>

important sequel light doesn't care

everything is a string and the data type

1073
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:21,160
is there solely for convenience so you

1074

can stick strings into a field of the

00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,680
it supports the lovely dash dash as a

1106
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,270

fun things like your master tables

just a single database in a file has a

lovely table called sequel light master

1116

from sequel master and this gives you

1120

all the tables in the database it has a

everything like what the primary keys

1128
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:22,830
are what the indexes are what the data

1129
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,480
types are which you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really care</font>

1130
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:29,259
so just by poking around with sequel

1131
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,030
master you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do really nasty things so</font>

1134

1141
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,990

1142
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,940
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sequel injection</font>

1143
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:20,529
what's a fun character to stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

1146
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,200

place so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do here is I'm</font>

1157
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,230
going to say can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all see that in the</font>

1158
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,560

1159
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,560
going to help

1160
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,529
alright so here we go sorry yeah let me

1161
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:10,799
close a little couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> these toolbars</font>

1162
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:12,690
here that's how I roll I roll with what

1163
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:14,250
did you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point I roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

1164
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:17,849
web developer toolbar and switch proxy

1165
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:19,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're gonna do I'm in</font>

1166
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:21,270
this so basically what I'm assuming here

1167
00:46:19,799 --> 00:46:23,220
because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a list app and it says</font>

1168
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,170
load this list is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming in the</font>

1169
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,509
back end I'm actually not the back end

1170
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:31,049
the client end it's basically saying

1171
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay give me the all of the list items</font>

1172
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:35,940
that Billy has in his list where the

1173
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:38,368
list is equal to to do so of course what

1174
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:43,079
I'm going to do is close that and say

1175
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:46,319
and 1 equals 0 so that first statement

1176
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,510
the Select you know give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me all the</font>

1177
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,160
items where the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to do it's not</font>

1178
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:52,200
going to return<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything now if I</font>

1179
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,240
actually comment that out click load

1180
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,859
list I get nothing back because I said

1181
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,558
give me all the items where the list

1182
00:46:55,859 --> 00:47:02,900
name is to do and 1 equals 0 which never

1183
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,650
happens whoo but what I am going to do

1184
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,579
that's what happened when you click

1185
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:16,339
backspace what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to do is say</font>

1186
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Union select name from sequel light</font>

1187
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:25,710
master load list ah items and list

1188
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,299
select star so I'm basically I just

1189
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,210
figured out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user to find tables</font>

1190
00:47:27,299 --> 00:47:36,119
in this database are select star from

1191
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:38,630
items list oh so I see an<font color="#CCCCCC"> heir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1192
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I did star and see here we see</font>

1193
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:44,220
Union does not have the same number of

1194
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:46,680
columns so I did come here and just do

1195
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:50,308
select I don't know what these things

1196
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,410
are maybe name I don't know what a valid

1197
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:54,240
column is in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what I'm</font>

1198
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:55,980
going to do though is all say select I

1199
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,439
can find out tho cuz I'd say select

1200
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:03,190
sequel

1201
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:06,530
or select sequel from sequel light

1202
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:08,390
master test<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1203
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">give me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sequel that was used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1204
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:12,410
construct those user-defined tables here

1205
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,450
we see create table so there's an item's

1206
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:18,859
table that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an eye I assume that's</font>

1207
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:21,890
item<font color="#CCCCCC"> id we see there's a lists which is</font>

1208
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:26,869
a name at bar char so let's go ahead and

1209
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:29,390
just give me so it's got a list ID and a

1210
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:36,849
name so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say select give</font>

1211
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:36,848
me all the all the items from lists ah

1212
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:40,460
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a couple lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have one</font>

1213
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:43,849
called to do and then I have one called

1214
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:45,290
secret plans interesting so basically I

1215
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:47,750
could sit here in single injectors all

1216
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:51,619
day long I've actually sending commands

1217
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:53,390
to it if we come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we see you</font>

1218
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:56,510
know I through the the tick we see the

1219
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:58,700
error message I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union select that's</font>

1220
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,319
all a pain in the ass so I wrote a

1221
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,710
lovely little piece of JavaScript that

1222
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually can plug into an XSS</font>

1223
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,030
payload called GG hook that actually

1224
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:10,220
just hooks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google gears and dumps</font>

1225
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:12,079
everything out and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we here we see</font>

1226
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:14,689
that I don't know if y'all can see this

1227
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,240
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back I hope I pulled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out from the</font>

1228
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:19,369
items table you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> make prezzo you</font>

1229
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:23,240
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> steal nuclear weapons call you in a</font>

1230
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:24,710
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> billion dollars pinky so I've</font>

1231
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,390
actually been able to dump the database

1232
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,920
now I wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in my book I</font>

1233
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,210
never actually released this code press

1234
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">white kept asking me for this code</font>

1235
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:35,089
luckily somebody else wrote a tool that

1236
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:37,640
does this and releases released it it's

1237
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually called the guy is Alberto and</font>

1238
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:43,220
he wrote a tool called html5 CS dump

1239
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:45,650
which is html5 side<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it should be</font>

1240
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,720
html5 client side dump this dumps

1241
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,089
everything out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly suggest you grab</font>

1242
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,040
it now the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

1243
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:54,349
ask me about with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> client-side</font>

1244
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,119
sequel injection as they say okay you

1245
00:49:54,349 --> 00:49:58,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what why is this important you know</font>

1246
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,980
extracting the data is hard I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1247
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:02,990
I was sequel injecting myself what I

1248
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:04,970
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is be able to send a</font>

1249
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,310
command that goes down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somebody's</font>

1250
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,660
machine so when they're offline it

1251
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,910
something nasty to their database

1252
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,830
selecting data out is difficult because

1253
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:16,009
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get that information sent back</font>

1254
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:17,990
to me well remember sequel injection

1255
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:19,880
isn't about stealing data sequel

1256
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:23,569
injection is about executing database

1257
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:25,130
commands like drop delete shut down all

1258
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:26,720
sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other fun stuff so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1259
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:29,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">corrupt the hell out of their database</font>

1260
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,040
no problem this has occurred in awhile

1261
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:34,040
Michael Sutton actually just gave a

1262

he just grave and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoes me gave an</font>

1265
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,260

1266
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:43,970

I'll probably never actually give it

1273

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really need my code the moral of</font>

the story here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> slotkin catting your</font>

password yes sequel injectable because

1281
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:21,260
what happens if username or password is

1282
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,030
semicolon shut down with no wait no you

1283
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,470
add this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then send it to the</font>

00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,359
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really saying is attacker here's</font>

1287
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,120
a shell for you to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database</font>

1288
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,040
anything you like so the same way we

1289
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,350
have parameterize sequel queries on

1290
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:38,540
server-side languages we also have

1291
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameterize sequel statements in this</font>

1292
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,890
client-side database so Google gears

1293
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,770
allows you to put in question marks

1294
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,480
where username equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> ? and password</font>

equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> question mark and then you simply</font>

1296
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,180
pass it the variables you want to stick

1297
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,770
in so don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this now here's the thing</font>

1298
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,390
and we're about to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in a</font>

1299
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,890
moment is most developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1300
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,200
understand this stuff they make the

1301
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:04,339
stupid mistakes and I have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say shame</font>

1302
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:06,410
on the major essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> app dev company</font>

1303
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,330
so Microsoft is horrible for this who

1304
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:10,970
here has ever gone to msdn<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft</font>

00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:13,670

1308
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,259
when they talk about sequel is sequel

1309
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,910
injectable the only one

1310
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:25,910
that isn't is the one that talks about

1311
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:28,759
parameterised queries every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other page</font>

1312
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,960
is injectable now here's the thing at

1313
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the day you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should trust</font>

1314
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,630
Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay nevermind I take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1315
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:37,460
back you would think you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

1316
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,650
Microsoft as a developer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would</font>

1317
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,480
give you accurate documentation the

1318
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,980
problem is is that they don't and so

1319
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:48,860
developers end up in the state where

1320
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:51,230
they don't know what to do this is the

1321
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,970
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we end up with developers are</font>

1322
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,710
just like Sally and accounting they

1323
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:57,080
don't know security they know how to

1324
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:58,430
build applications and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss is on</font>

1325
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,330
their ass trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1326
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:04,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door so the barriers to web dev this</font>

1327
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the other problem we're having with</font>

1328
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,690
these offline apps that are becoming

1329
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,250
more powerful you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we moved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

1331
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,370
weren't doing really interesting things

1332
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean there there were expense</font>

1333
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:17,480
reporting systems there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were certainly a</font>

1334
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,880
lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could access you</font>

user active it makes sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> for say</font>

00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,750
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your call center who are</font>

1339
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,040
logging maybe support calls or something

00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:31,150
chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they're using web-based</font>

1341
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:33,560
system I actually worked at a this

1342
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:35,300
insurance company called Crawford and

1343
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,920
company they're actually fairly large

1344
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,410
but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like allstate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1345
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,050
they're more business and industry and

1346
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:45,200
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to ensure my fleet of 747</font>

distinctly in the fall of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99 having to</font>

1349
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,300
walk around it in store like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oracle 8g</font>

1350
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,720
or something on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these systems in</font>

1351
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,280
their call center because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they weren't</font>

1352
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,980
using web-based system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all client</font>

1353
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,420
server based so but so many things are

1354
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,370
moving to the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's so cheap</font>

barriers for people to pick up and build

1357
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,100
web apps is very very slim as well so

1358
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,010
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the lamp stack it's free you've</font>

1359
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,420
got an amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> web server I mean anybody</font>

1360
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,310
who's actually ever dug around and

1361
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,870
apache and looked at the modules I mean

1362
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:23,600
yeah there's some crazy but the

1363
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:25,790
fact that i can really from just open

1364
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,279
source software scale up a giant

1365
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:30,950
business on top of PHP and memcache and

1366
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,140
apache and have it be as fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1367
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of and scalable as it is I mean</font>

1368
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">really is incredible when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1369
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,570
think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1370
00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:41,000
exist this idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do and</font>

1371
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:44,180
prosper so much ten years ago 10 years

1372
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,060
ago you had all sorts of crazy esoteric

1373
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,470
but kind of boutique web servers use

1374
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,869
each web server still exists because

1375
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,279
it's so fast but you just people went

1376
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:53,900
bought web servers people don't

1377
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:56,240
necessarily do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore they think</font>

1378
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:59,210
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware the software is a</font>

1379
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,729
commodity at this stage um language

1380
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:04,160
portability this is a funny story I deal

1381
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,660
a lot with web developers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling</font>

1382
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,250
them look here's the mistakes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

1383
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,950
and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite people in the world</font>

1384
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:12,710
favorite people in the world are people

1385
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:14,299
who know how to use Dreamweaver and no

1386
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,770
no no<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not for the reason you</font>

1387
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,930
think it's not because they're hook code

1388
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:21,530
is full of holes because good lord it is

1389
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:23,270
but they take the news so well I cannot

1390

tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how many times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been called</font>

got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a computer science background you're</font>

1406
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:58,040
a punk kid I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to listen to you</font>

1407
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,990
the the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who knew Dreamweaver they</font>

1408
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,700
started as liberal artists or they

1409
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,799
started as you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

1412
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,470
websites and then you know a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1413
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,270
later they were asked hey come in give

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphic art side into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:27,619
not receptive at all to security I

1432
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:51,700
there's a there's a bug and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing</font>

1433
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,680
was is this actually was written as a

nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> Appy filter and I was actually</font>

buffer overflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I go to Emma by</font>

1436
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,299
Jerry you know we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem this is</font>

1437

1441
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:15,160
characters I'm like Jerry dare to dream

1442
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:19,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a world where somebody types in more</font>

1443
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:21,098
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight characters it's the same</font>

1444
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing they're like no no people are</font>

1445
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:26,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to use JavaScript like that you</font>

1446
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,288
know so it's it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing you</font>

1447
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,849
have diverse programming backgrounds you

1448
00:57:29,289 --> 00:57:33,069
also have different threat models with

1449
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:34,779
web apps versus desktop apps and this is

1450
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:36,249
why we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting we're having it's</font>

1451
00:57:34,779 --> 00:57:38,619
really a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfect storm we're having</font>

1452
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:41,229
these technologies getting thrown in

1453
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:42,549
very rapidly we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having developers who</font>

1454
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:43,899
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they're doing who</font>

1455
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:46,359
are getting thrown<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this by the</font>

1456
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,489
scent of money I mean I remember two

1457
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:51,308
years ago thinking my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> News Corp</font>

00:57:48,489 --> 00:57:53,380
spent 400 million for myspace those dumb

00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:56,559
bastards that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a really good</font>

1460
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,599
deal right now when Facebook which has

1461
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,400
zero revenue model at all and

1462
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,769
essentially hardly any advertising

1463
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,499
revenue at all is valued at two billion

1464
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:09,700
dollars Twitter what the john

1465
00:58:05,499 --> 00:58:12,160
mccain is twittering now you know yeah

1466
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly not very well you know they got</font>

1467
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,710
just valuated at basically around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

1468
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:18,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and was that they had a deal I'm trying</font>

1469
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remember the details I've been</font>

1470
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:23,740
drinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

1474
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:32,900
of other things I can do to them so you

1475
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,819

1482
00:58:52,070 --> 00:59:00,170
some girly Billy drinks that are over

1483
00:58:54,110 --> 00:59:04,010
against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall if it's not pink with a</font>

1484
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:20,030
sugar rim I don't want it needless to

1485
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:22,640
say all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that doesn't have a sugar</font>

1486
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:29,510
rim so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have kind of this</font>

1487
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:30,740
perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> storm that birds you really have</font>

1488
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">this perfect store where you have new</font>

1489
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,649
technologies you've got people who don't

1490
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,070
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're doing you have money</font>

1491
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:39,170
and you have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this shift where</font>

1492
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:41,450
it's not really clear you know used to

1493
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:43,190
be it's all on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server just validate</font>

1494
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,899
stuff now it's well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind on the</font>

1495
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,580
server it's kinda on the client its kind

1496
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,830
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cloud we're running half the</font>

1497
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,380
on amazon systems you know it's it's

1498
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:53,330
it's getting very ambiguous about where

1499
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:55,640
do you do security who's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1500
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,710
it and this is why we have some of these

1501
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,830
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the developer knowledge</font>

1502
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:03,290
problem really is almost eclipsing the

1503
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:04,640
others I'll give you a perfect example I

1504
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,440
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to explain this to someone if</font>

1505
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,270
you have a thick client in service let's

1506
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,700
say I have some type of word processing

1507
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:13,730
app with maybe a SAN storage system

1508
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,020
somewhere so if somebody is bad they can

1509
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">only hurt themselves let me give you a</font>

1510
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,450
perfect example and I think I might have

1511
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:20,030
given this last year but it's a good

1512
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:22,009
example if I find and I'm not saying

1513
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:24,800
this exists but let's say a Microsoft

1514
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:27,619
Word I pop open the find dialog and I

1515
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:29,359
type in 8,000 pipe characters I press

1516
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:31,130
ENTER and I make it puke memory

1517
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,720
corruption they they weren't expecting

1518
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:34,030
that much I have a code execution

1519
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,939
vulnerability

1520
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:38,710
who cares all I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is I'm crashing</font>

1521
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,270
the application I'm using the app why

1522
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,520
would I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> crash it it's not</font>

1523
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:45,970
remotely exploitable it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like it's</font>

1524
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:51,400
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file format and um despite it</font>

1525
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:53,109
being um I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry well it comes in</font>

1526
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,790
through email but it's it's it's in the

1527
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,440
find dialog right so you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1528
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:59,440
to open the find dialog and type this

1529
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,330
thing into the find box so that's going

1530
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,370
to only<font color="#E5E5E5"> crash a user's machine and even</font>

1531
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:05,680
if I got code execution I'm executing

1532
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:07,299
code as myself why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go through</font>

1533
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that much trouble to execute code as</font>

1534
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,370
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go file run I mean</font>

1535
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,350
who cares now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll think about something</font>

1536
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:16,390
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in google apps if somebody</font>

1537
01:01:14,350 --> 01:01:18,370
gets hurt every but if somebody's bad

1538
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:20,650
everybody gets hurt so if i take eight

1539
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:22,359
thousand pipes into this little dialogue

1540
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:25,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript gives me that actually</font>

1541
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:27,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses soap to contact a web service back</font>

1542
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:29,680
at gmail to actually say spell check

1543
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:31,990
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote or do a find a sort of</font>
