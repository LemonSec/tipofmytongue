so we had a few entries here some of

81
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:59,530
them require a little bit of

82
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:04,240
manipulation so we had four entries can

83
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:08,590
everybody say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we've had enough of a</font>

competition you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick one of the</font>

145
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,560
books that Billy brought which it seems

146
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,300
you've picked hacking web applications

147
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,459
exposed I don't know why Billy would

148
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,160
have a book like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you also have</font>

149
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,959
the purple skittle vodka that lady

150
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,850
Merlin made so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be puking</font>

151
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:11,069
that up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> about four hours enjoy that</font>

152
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll have pictures of it so who figured</font>

153
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:16,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the deal with the badges he's</font>

154
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:21,720
actually gone around looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for do what</font>

155
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,579
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we we steal things back and</font>

156
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth from each from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the different cons</font>

157
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:28,620
of course shmoocon unfortunately gets to

158
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,910
do it with a larger budget so there's

159
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:39,420
much much cooler<font color="#E5E5E5"> than ours one year they</font>

160
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:41,430
did do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yeah yeah well we don't</font>

161
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,719
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about that kids should if</font>

162
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would make your own badge for</font>

163
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
this if you do it what good enough job

164
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,420
and putting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in charge of it so a</font>

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,640
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago Heidi had metal badges</font>

166
00:09:51,420 --> 00:10:01,469
that they had cut out that actually had

167
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:04,140
waved edges to them yes literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

168
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,820
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me go man that's that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

169
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,620
cool then you realize well if you put

170
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,310
them together some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them match up oh</font>

171
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,630
 so everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so everyone's</font>

172
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,219
wondering around kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking them</font>

173
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,839
out when we realized wow that's a great

174
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">know social experiment everyone has to</font>

175
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,670
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least walk up and</font>

176
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,120
grab you by the badge so so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

177
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,439
of done that every every year we try to

178
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something that's a little bit more</font>

179
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,050
inventive so last year the<font color="#E5E5E5"> makers crew</font>

180
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,760
got eight people together not exactly

181
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,490
all of them were the makers but they did

182
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,689
all the legwork to do it we had QR codes

183
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't know if anybody's got one of the

184
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,110
badges<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them had QR codes and a reader</font>

185
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,000
and you could read it again

186
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,620
view your<font color="#CCCCCC"> coat and your friends code and</font>

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,420
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> went around and found out what</font>

188
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,970
their code numbers were and you matched

189
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,189
up and you made your chain of people so

190
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,920
I thought well let's not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

191
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,970
easy on the guys if we end up using

192
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,219
numbers all they're going to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk</font>

193
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,390
up in him snap the QR code get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with</font>

194
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:03,060
easily so I was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get here at</font>

195
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,660
like five o'clock on Friday you know

196
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,430
left it you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> o'clock it took us</font>

197
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">till ten o'clock with that Chattanooga</font>

198
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,959
traffic incident there so there are

199
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,339
pictures of us playing yagi ball on the

200
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,670
side of the interstate while we waited

201
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,860
for the total pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these yagi</font>

202
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,269
antenna we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tennis ball the guys in</font>

203
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">the trucks were actually kind of</font>

204
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,519
laughing at us because there was nothing

205
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,100
to do so I wrote some code to go through

206
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,959
and generate random characters typed it

207
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,579
in as wing-dings please don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

wing-dings together and did all the

211
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,230
