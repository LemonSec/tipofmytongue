Bush administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right ok so in</font>

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,960
2003 our office recently concluded that

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Fourth Amendment has no application</font>

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,420
to domestic military operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> whew</font>

11
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:31,320
anybody remember the Posse Comitatus

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,759
laws they didn't apparently anyway so

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,559
that's that's kind of crazy one if they

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,910
decide the military sindermann invade

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,530
your house the Fourth Amendment didn't

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,879
apply I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect the current</font>

19
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,100
wouldn't hold up in a court but so in

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">rete eres bombings 2009 just came out as</font>

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,129
a februari case again the Fourth

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,170
Amendment's requirement of reasonably

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,269
says not but not the warrant Clause

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,860
applies to extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> terial to the</font>

25
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,020
extraterritorial searches and seizures

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,519
of US citizens so there were two

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,829
naturalized US citizens i think it was

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,589
Tanzania or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ganda somewhere they</font>

29
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,900
basically went in and searched their

30
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,880
houses without a warrant they just went

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,610
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I assume they got permission</font>

from the the government from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,369
country they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> searching in and from</font>

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sovereign state i should say but uh</font>

36
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,820
they went in no warrant searched it no

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,258
problem it had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reasonable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

38
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,639
can't walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in rape the wife and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot</font>

39
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,170
the dog but they can just walk in and

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,880
search<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything they want as long as it</font>

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:32,460
is reasonable without a warrant bite

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,079
them boy so that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact-based but</font>

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,960
yes if it was reasonable to shoot the

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,309
dog that's fine but um interesting

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,479
there's another case on point where they

46
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,400
went down to Mexico and<font color="#CCCCCC"> searched the</font>

47
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dragged him up there's</font>

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,450
stuff like this but this is interesting

49
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,070
case so it's funny only half the the

50
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,360
fourth<font color="#CCCCCC"> minimum applies to citizens mind</font>

51
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,279
you this is American citizens these are

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,990
naturalized citizens if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your exit</font>

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside the state so if you go outside</font>

54
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,570
the country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just want to come</font>

55
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,649
check something out as long as they can

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,179
permission from the government they can

57
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,130
just come do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as long as it's</font>

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,210
reasonable so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to be</font>

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:06,630
searched stay in the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently we're</font>

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">not sure we'll figure it out later maybe</font>

61
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,150
yes if they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see the</font>

foreign can have different balls

63
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,189
well it's probably been following the

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,150
same thing they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get</font>

65
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:21,150
permission from the sovereign<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:23,040
point have fun on a boat but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

67
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">just some random cases just in recent</font>

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,030
times that have some funny stuff coming

69
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:28,469
up haryanvi us the this is a Supreme

70
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,150
Court case exclusionary rule does not

71
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:31,769
apply when the police mistakes are the

72
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,349
result of negligence such as that

73
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,379
described here basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case</font>

74
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,399
what had happened is a guy came in to

75
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,230
pick up and get something out of his

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,819
truck that had been impounded they went

77
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,500
in there an officer recognized him as a

78
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,388
troublemaker decided to run a warrant

79
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,290
search<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBI Nia outstanding warrants</font>

80
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,959
because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do that no</font>

81
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,879
problem searches for it nothing in his

82

County calls the county next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,189
says hey you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this guy in here</font>

84
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,709
I know he<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his trouble for both of</font>

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,699
him and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes well so the guy</font>

87
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:01,319
the cop pulls him over arrest him for an

88
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:03,180
outstanding warrant violation blah blah

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,810

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,400
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that and he had marijuana</font>

92
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,389
in the car so they booked him on

left the clerk called back and said

97
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:19,259
whoops nevermind my mistake completely

98
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,090
fine the Supreme Court<font color="#E5E5E5"> says not a</font>

99
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:22,708
problem there it was unintentional<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

100
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,419
it was so far removed they didn't set it

101
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,250
up it was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was basically a good-faith</font>

102
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,430
doctrine so keep that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind if you</font>

103
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,019
have any outstanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant or might</font>

104
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,919
but I have usually problems of these

105
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,479
kind of decisions because I think

106
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're subject to abuse and that's</font>

107
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually what the exclusionary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rule is</font>

108
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:38,220
for it's a harsh punishment people

109
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,229
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> off on technicalities or because</font>

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,780
they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to very very strict</font>

00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,819
to prevent the government from doing

things they shouldn't there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

be Steven Stephenson this is a Minnesota

case this is not federal<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font>

126
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,000
keep this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind it is an appellate</font>

127
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:13,798
case but it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be persuasion</font>

128
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,150
ery defendant excluded from his home by

129
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,608
court order had no reasonable

130
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,199
expectation of privacy so he was told

131
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:20,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home probably domestic dispute</font>

132
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,959
you know something along those lines so

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,250
you can't go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your house since</font>

134
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,770
he'd been excluded by a court order he

135
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,229
no longer

136
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,280
had an imitator expect a shin of privacy

137
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,780
government tell him to get out his ass

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:48,008
and then they can go search it cool huh

139
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:49,119
interesting probably not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

140
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">they wouldn't be subject to the same</font>

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,610
rules as probation when you go on

142
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,389
probation you're like I'm making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deal</font>

143
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,289
with the government on in this case well

144
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,330
yeah I mean if you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

145
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:01,210
smoking a joint and shooting firearms

146
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:05,198
