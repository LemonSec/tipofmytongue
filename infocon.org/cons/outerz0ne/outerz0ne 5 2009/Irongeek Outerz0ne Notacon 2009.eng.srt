00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:06,699
geek crotch cam as you can see

144
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,750
sexy<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow laggy but in a woman a pinch</font>

145
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:23,930
the way this bedroom basically works is

146
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,869
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a d-link wireless cam</font>

147
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:31,129
and I've improvised a little bit I got

148
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:34,460
12 volt battery in the uninterruptible

149
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,919
power supply a car adapter to drop

150
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,590
patrol boats down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 5 volts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've</font>

151
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,799
basically started wires together make

152
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,830
the connection on the power to my d-link

153
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and hopefully if I can find an access</font>

154
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,659
point that actually allows access

155
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:56,120
perfume<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of convention I'll just</font>

156
00:07:50,659 --> 00:08:01,870
walk around with this codpiece on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we</font>

157
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,870
had the iron geek personal crotch cam

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,960
goes me moving around that's not you

159
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,840
know when I go away my car doesn't want

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,150
to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular scene essentially</font>

161
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:21,948
what we have is a wireless webcam d-link

162
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:24,799
got that strapped in<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a 12-volt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

163
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:26,810
trove of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 5 volt adapter that's meant</font>

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
for cause and I've essentially started

165
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,979
all the wires to write connectors and I

166
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,649
have an uninterruptible power supplies

167
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:35,630
battery now hopefully I'll be able to

168
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around the convention with this</font>

170
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,399
tell it to connect to and stay connected

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:46,070
to do it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the con you know so you</font>

172
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:49,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how well it was I've got</font>

173
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,209
a glutton party going on right now

174
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,750
Michael yeah and you go tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about</font>

175
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaintext info project yeah</font>

176
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,310
yeah we're girl we got a half LEM is

177
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,680
currently on your leg medicine will get

178
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,479
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mario's an exchange team I like when</font>

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go on visit site and somebody uses</font>

180
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,380
malicious code essential to another site

181
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,729
you can use that to grab their password

182
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,740
it's the first seven bites of the

183
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,480
password which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elyon walk so then you</font>

184
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,820
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes like us some solid</font>

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,620
key and use the that's a challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

186
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,170
actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kid challenge key yeah</font>

187
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,820
put it with the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> LM hash then</font>

188
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,360
sends back right yeah but you're making

189
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">them you certain given challenge so so</font>

190
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,590
you basically can build a rainbow table

191
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,130
yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaintext does it's pretty</font>

192
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:46,780
salted that's that's my own page yeah I

193
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:50,439
think I the solid key is it's like why

194
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:52,420
13 11 22 and keeps going and then you

195
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,500
just build a<font color="#CCCCCC"> grandma table for the first</font>

196
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,569
one through seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how you're</font>

197
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,520
getting seven you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the first</font>

198
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,560
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> bites in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the LM well that Liuzzo</font>

199
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,230
LEM and then that's why it's happening

200
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,400
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only can have them so we're</font>

201
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently got tables building for that</font>

202
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,209
and this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available online to</font>

203
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,470
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could this submit a hash</font>

204
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:11,290
and try to crack the project still

205
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,120
building up currently we're trying to

206
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,430
build a trusted admins once we get to

207
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,680
work comfortable we will release an open

208
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,020
source code recruit below entered it in

209
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,329
to help build tables word<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists and</font>

210
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,130
other techniques to prove we get weak

211
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,230
encryption is no longer needed on the

212
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font>

213
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,340
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta step up and use a real</font>

214
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,010
powerful encryption because they're

215
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,530
leaving their consumers vulnerable so

216
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,450
again it's really nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

217
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,100
nothing malicious in this intent but

218
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,900
just to prove a point that the current

219
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,670
encryption mechanisms used in most

220
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,910
operating systems that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly</font>

221
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,400
available aren't secure so the end users

222
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">really loved venerable do the lack of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption now Mara know just</font>

224
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about who da mixing my metaphors modern</font>

225
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,710
versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows and say this and so</font>

226
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,839
far i know they turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMK hash</font>

227
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,000
storage by default they also don't pass

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,350
alum hash as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine it depends it</font>

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,660
really depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm and depends if it's</font>

230
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,670
in a domain and they have older machines

231
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,430
they have to be backwards compatible so

232
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,260
they have to keep LM<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to keep it</font>

233
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,640
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the default policy on what to</font>

234
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,040
send it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your policy</font>

235
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,990
management but other the default policy

236
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,089
from my understanding currently is LM

237
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,540
for backwards compatibility unless you

238
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:26,400
explicitly apply ntlm which is more like

239
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,260
an md5 password which isn't have the

240
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,090
seven character weakness but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,120
proper word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and technology and with</font>

242
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,460
the fact of using ps3's video cards and

243
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,830
large SQL databases you're still you're

244
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,680
still vulnerable to brute force easily

245
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,660
up to 14 characters so I mean really

246
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,609
your passwords really have to be if you

247
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,930
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology that's behind the</font>

to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell them</font>

254
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,449
but I mean it again noting that the

plaintext thought info project does is

256
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,569
considered malicious but again we

257
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">wouldn't bring awareness and we also</font>

258
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,139
want to help out the penetration testers

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,339
and researchers understand the

260
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,680
weaknesses and current encryption

261
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:14,320
schemes and provide a method to prove

262
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,939
vote you know password weakness that's

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,029
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard thing I mean if you</font>

264
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,279
dump the current password database from

265
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,930
domain controller and you're an

266
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,189
administrator you wouldn't get that

267
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,800
unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were the administrator</font>

sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your encryption is properly</font>

343
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,709
beyond that you can use euro symbols

can build a table set for each type

351
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,519
remember if you're doing a client-server

352
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,620

when you do apply several distribution

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,760
you don't need 40 terabytes of rainbow

370

tables when you have 4,000 people

posting so many gigs

372

377
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:30,410
what's the point since those John does

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,929
fact processors such as parallel

enormous hashes per second so eventually

386
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:52,699
rainbow tables will become obsolete but

387
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">again like the plain text on info set up</font>

there we're not just using rainbow

389

tables reason rainbow tables word list

390
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,149
we're also using some of the video are

hacking techniques that an insider<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro</font>

expand again we're not looking to do

anything malicious but we're basically

395
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:08,178
going out there where we've been totally

camping done I'm improving a camping

397

time and again I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do an honest a</font>

398
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,490

403
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:24,529
really is to support the pen testing

community bring awareness to password

405
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:29,120
encryption security and basically to

406
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,259
take the industry to the next level all

407
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,989
right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to play any</font>

417
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:51,889
languages in the future because we

418
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,389
understand that everybody has native

420
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,570

thanks for you precon<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up good</font>

440
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:44,350
a couple hours as far as trying to

441
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:46,980
figure out how to get the drum apart

442

that's what I'm learning right now how

448
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:05,499
to do so it takes me more time to write

449

the code than it does to put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

480
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,049
though it's no longer my crotch because

481
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,629
quite frankly it's getting uncomfortable

482
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay without the actual day the cod and</font>

what's left of them encoding upstairs

485
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:05,850
and just for my first I love it babe I

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sky dogs and whose pocket I'm here</font>

but it's been a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for small</font>

492
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,580
talk something really good I said no I

493
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,459
had a short like you and I see a few

494
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,120
offense during the party session at the

495
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:33,390
card reported on is now over and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

496
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,719
sit on children or wife or you see this

497
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,720
video

498
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,010
videos explains what the you got

499
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,659
him low-tech<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I've got the lily pad</font>

500
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,610
which is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino or should they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

501
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,870
gallon so nor do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more light in</font>

502
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,729
here do you and me more like you only

503
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:03,270
know more like I need more light the doc

504
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:06,900
is good I'm kind of afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the dark</font>

505
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:09,240
hey boy oh my gosh should be afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

506
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,960
very afraid this is the Arduino lily pad

507
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,570
it is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Arduino based</font>

508
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,980
microcontroller it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

509
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:23,060
regular Arduino I do that so it into

510
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,880
some time but it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a smaller</font>

511
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:29,940
microcontroller I see it's embedded and

512
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,790
whereas the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a dip socket</font>

513
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,610
and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept with this</font>

514
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,530
Arduino lily pad which was made by Leo

515
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,419
Buckley I may be saying that completely

516
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:43,350
wrong but you notice got a bunch of

517
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:45,480
holes here instead of the heads so what

518
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,189
you can do is you could put this on tour

519
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,350
your shirt and use something like

520
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,750
conductive thread which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

521
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:54,060
as wire so there's different types of

522
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,490
conductive thread you have what does it

523
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,310
got like they have conductive material

524
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,250
and I'm some have copper some have

525
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,500
silver they use different materials some

526
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,810
have different qualities different

527
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,540
thicknesses have different resistance

528
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:12,270
values as far as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe this has an</font>

529
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,490
18 ohm resistance and the value but

530
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,440
basically the concept is as i take this

531
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,270
thread and I wrap it through the holes

532
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,290
with the needle a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times through</font>

533
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,480
my shirt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then i hook it up to</font>

534
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,659
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like an alien</font>

535
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,640
and I have a t-shirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> that blinks LEDs or</font>

536
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,730
does a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things and</font>

537
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,060
because we all like blinky lights

538
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,520
everybody yes we do so but the idea is

539
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,350
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd have also like a power</font>

540
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,690
supply or something wired into my shirt

541
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,669
so I can remove the battery I can throw

542
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,940
this into the washer because it's using

543
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:49,250
thread some people like to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

544
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,710
like puffy paint or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,170
thread to help select when you wash it

546
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,570
you don't lose the conductivity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

547
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,580
thread but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you can take</font>

548
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,639
out the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply the battery you can</font>

549
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">wash this you can dry it and then you</font>

550
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,360
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all over again you can put</font>

551
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,580
the battery back in the bottom of the

552
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,199
shirt for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people like to to</font>

553
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,899
stash the battery just cussed awaits at

554
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,300
the bottom one of those Wilbur get a

555
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,120
