<font color="#CCCCCC">collected we're trying to sort through</font>

23
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,179
and occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll fire up the screen</font>

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,280
press and do some shirts these search

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,939
were actually done yesterday morning

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,799
about 4am um so typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do it at the</font>

27
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,039
last moment is terrible but I enjoy

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it so what I've found is that</font>

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,119
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton of resources on the</font>

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,530
internet to explain how to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,360
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time you get a hold a</font>

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,579
cafepress you send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> some graphics</font>

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,439
and they each get one and send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

34
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone goes hey look I had a shirt</font>

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,729
printed well yeah you had it printed off

36
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,680
an inkjet printer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is actually how</font>

37
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,220
it's been done in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past it's you know</font>

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,200
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a plastisol yelling in the</font>

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,600
mic there it's a plastisol<font color="#E5E5E5"> ink it</font>

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,159
stretches it dries well anything else

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">you normally get done through cafepress</font>

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,380
last a little while but it comes off and

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,000
goes away and fades really easy so this

44
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,690
is actually how it's been done since

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,410
everyone was a stoner and

46
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,910
out of the garage so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

47
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,490
everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> being staring at the kitty</font>

48
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,700
cat picture but I put this up as an

49
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,010
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alma when I put out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,989
kids and tits and kitties in it so I

51
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,030
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was kind of appealing but</font>

52
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:32,290
um kidding you you would pick that one

53
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,330
up actually you dog so I kind of put

54
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:37,239
this up to show different types of

55
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:38,940
artwork got line art here this is

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the page of the</font>

57
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,600
outer zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page and I think Nikki</font>

58
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:46,450
paints funny as I'll get outside just

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,910
threw her in there um what I typically

60
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,709
do is basically line art if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like the the makers</font>

62
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,300
local guys if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their t-shirts</font>

63
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,340
they have a dot pattern to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray so</font>

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,960
I don't do a lot of that mainly because

65
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,030
I haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bored and most of</font>

66
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,380
what i end up having to do is text or

67
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:08,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">something similar so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of</font>

68
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,320
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> I deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time later on</font>

69
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,959
the foam cores over here I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

70
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,150
it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything but as a tradition</font>

71
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,770
now know how this got started but it

72
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,670
started probably like everything else we

73
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:23,680
do around this joint we put up foam core

74
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:25,269
in the back with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little blue lines on</font>

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,040
it gave everybody a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharpie to write</font>

76
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,220
with and said write your name on your

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,290
handle or whatever and just like the

78
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign-in board and everyone signed it and</font>

79
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,109
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh cool this is the am</font>

80
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,339
I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with this now so we kind</font>

81
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,370
of thought well Jesus have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up</font>

82
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,170
with something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it then became the I</font>

83
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,480
know what we'll do we'll cut these apart

84
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,030
will scan them in and we'll put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on</font>

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,738
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the t-shirt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I actually</font>

86
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,630
have several of the shirts that we've

87
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:55,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected over time that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has you know</font>

88

92
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,130
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of graphic and everything</font>

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,420
it got pretty interesting but for what

94
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,489
we were doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just kind of nice</font>

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,180
pays attention to him anymore just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,130
staff one so i actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have invested</font>

115
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,230
probably about a thousand dollars into

116
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,159
my screen printing rig and it started

117
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,810
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a little speedball claim made by</font>

118
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,810
ain't half by<font color="#E5E5E5"> eleven or you know</font>

119
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,210
somewhat similar sized we would lay it

120
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,130
down over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a t-shirt run a</font>

121
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,400
squeegee across it impress ink into the

122
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,920
shirt and then peel it off it was

123
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,830
heinous but we got ink on a shirt and we

124
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,470
were thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by that so the original</font>

125
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,750
system that we put together was really

126
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,340
really crappy i started watching some of

127
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ryan at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple other</font>

128
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,900
places had put out and came up with some

129
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,970
really cool ideas and everything and

130
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">just over time I bought a press about</font>

131
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,200
other equipment invested in better

132
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,060
chemicals and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind</font>

133
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of got to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> position I'm in if you</font>

134
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,990
don't mind if you'll break all this out

135
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,310
and set<font color="#E5E5E5"> the set the frame up and we'll</font>

136
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:57,040
go through the chemicals everything so

137
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,950
one of the fun things he's ever worked

138
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:05,020
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a printing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry a couple guys</font>

139
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:07,870
guess what happens now no one worth a

140
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,060
damn goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight to film anymore they</font>

141
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,130
go straight to plate so getting a film

142
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,440
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> mate is very difficult even in</font>

143
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,530
Nashville which is the hub of printing

144
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,070
in the southeast so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a film</font>

145
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,320
positive meaning that the image that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

146
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,140
want to appear is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive a negative</font>

147
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,090
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reverse of this it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is often</font>

148
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,039
somewhat difficult to explain to someone

149
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,049
you want a positive because they say

150
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,139
well aren't thing puts out negative

151
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,879
no it's a film positive so this is

152
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,430
actually how much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see what it</font>

153
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,770
says this is the speaker shirt this year

154
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,620
I spoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 15 and all I got was this</font>

155
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,599
damn t-shirt so I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

156
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,759
that would be fun for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to wear</font>

157
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:52,960
around and you know what can you say I

158
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,259
can't get everybody a Porsche um so I I

159
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:05,789
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> several sheets of this artwork</font>

160
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:10,330
output and several do what yeah this is

161
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this is actually mylar it has</font>

162
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,289
inkjet printing on it this is for

163
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,919
neutral skateboards a buddy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine has</font>

164
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:20,020
a skateboard crew and he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

165
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,818
t-shirts there's his well if you can see

166
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,530
that worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> a damn the old man picture</font>

167
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:30,330
this is a sort of a milky mylar and my

168
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:33,400
concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> about using it is any kind of</font>

169
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,840
obstruction on the layer of mylar keeps

170
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,330
light from getting through and it's very

171
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,060
essential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the image</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

172
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:45,430
use vellum works but you've got to shoot

173
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a longer period of time do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i but</font>

174
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a very opaque image</font>

175
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,029
which means any ink and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so</font>

176
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,039
the reason I end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this is</font>

177
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,560
because of film negative if I have a

178
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,690
piece of this negative and I held it up

179
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,370
to the Sun I can look through it and see

180
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:06,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun because it's an actual opaque</font>

181
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,800
layer there so I can expose this image

182
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,739
for quite a period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still get</font>

183
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,300
exactly what I want without<font color="#E5E5E5"> burning out</font>

184
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black image and you'll see what</font>

185
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,180
that means in just a second so how they

186
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,979
used to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff the</font>

187
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,139
homebrew stuff which you took a screen

188
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:30,219
which it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

189
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:33,070
standard 110 mesh wooden screen they

190
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:36,059
make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aluminium</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 110 is actually</font>

191
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:40,110
the he knows what thread counts are in

192
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,299
and she's anyway

193
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,510
actually you can get a higher mesh

194
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,689
screen for higher quality printing and

195
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,209
things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use 110 for this</font>

196
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I'm shoving a very thick white</font>

197
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,540
ink through it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to put on the</font>

198
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,010
black shirt to this point I haven't

199
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,779
really wanted to do any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other colors a</font>

200
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,950
black shirt with white print is you know

201
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:04,380
what we all wear anyway so they used to

202
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the screen lay it down draw their</font>

203
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,620
image on it and then use a thing called

204
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,170
a resist and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like</font>

205
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,360
painting on paint onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen and</font>

206
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,540
where you didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to come through</font>

207
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,490
you had to paint this stuff on which was

208
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,649
boring and tedious and someone said

209
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,160
she's we can't make money<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this so</font>

210
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:25,260
they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with a method to use a</font>

211
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,939
sensitized I Hayes oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I</font>

212
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,939
brought mine with me today I left into

213
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,420
the shop um comes in a court bucket for

214
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,940
what I buy for 25 bucks it it's light

215
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,620
sensitive but not like film is but you

216
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,700
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mix it up and get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going and</font>

217
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,100
not expose it abroad<font color="#CCCCCC"> over out right so</font>

218
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,170
what you end up doing is taking this

219
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter of this bizarre pink colored</font>

220
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,649
liquid mixing a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> water in a</font>

221
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,899
container that's got a special

222
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:54,180
sensitizer and you mix it in blah blah

223
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,250
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> set it in the refrigerator for a</font>

224
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,859
while let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all the air bubbles come</font>

225
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,420
out and then for a good 30 60 days

226
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,730
something like that you have this

227
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,560
material I have three containers of it

228
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,060
that are all dead now<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I print</font>

229
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,209
shirts before freaknik<font color="#E5E5E5"> I printed before</font>

230
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,029
outer zone you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I use a certain</font>

231
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of it than I don't use anymore</font>

232
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,110
what I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is called a scoop</font>

233
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,219
coater this bizarre pink liquid here is

234
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the light sensitive emulsion</font>

235
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,810
yes this was actually done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dark</font>

236
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,850
at the consortium I've got a screen

237
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,979
frame that's been cleaned I take the

238
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,660
scoop coater at the bottom and I run it

239
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,440
up and literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just lays a real</font>

240
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,310
thin layer of this material on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,550
spend the frame around the other

242
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,768
direction and put it in through do the

243
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">backside first the front side and then</font>

244
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:46,860
get a nice thin layer going once i do

245
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,380
that you can see my reflection in the

246
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,140
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have a nice wet</font>

247
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,610
screen which anything that's this size

248
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,199
that you don't want to

249
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,790
hold off axis and have all of the

250
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">material slide down it has to be nice</font>

251
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and flat which I figured out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to fix</font>

252
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:05,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem hey we made our own drying</font>

253
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,200
unit so the consortium matt has actually

254
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,269
done some projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sizable amount</font>

255
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,240
but when it looks heinous doesn't it

256
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:17,160
it's actually a cisco power over

257
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,660
ethernet adapter hooked up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> four fans</font>

258
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i had a bunch leftover hell the frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

259
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,149
think yeah the interior this actually

260
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:28,850
has three shelves built into it so i

261
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,500
crack it open slide a couple of

262
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,500
sensitized frames in and close it up

263
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,899
it's got a not a help of filter but it's

264
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,380
got a filter set on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backside of it</font>

265
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,180
so it's pulling air across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the across</font>

266
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,829
the frames takes a couple hours to dry

267
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,479
them you know the way they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

268
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:52,500
but set them up and let them get

269
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:55,980
sensitized once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that what because</font>

270
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,510
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> take you know several hours to</font>

271
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,510
do just one if it's just sitting there

272
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,980
yeah it'll do the same thing yet put it

273
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,019
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bathroom or something like that</font>

274
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,329
that's the problem is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes very</font>

275
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,890
inconvenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you set them on top if</font>

276
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,300
your bed on a sheet of plywood you're

277
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,890
going to sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hours and someone</font>

278
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,349
says if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get that off the</font>

279
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,980
bed so I can go to sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll kill ya so</font>

280
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,149
hence we've got one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these now but</font>

281
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,860
yeah I built this to be able to deal

282
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:27,120
with more production work so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

283
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,079
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table of the consortium</font>

284
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,390
covered in crap you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the propane</font>

285
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:36,870
cylinder right next to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disc shooting</font>

286
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:40,649
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> gun from krogers um what we ended</font>

287
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">up doing this sheet of graphics has 75</font>

288
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:47,250
names on it plus it has this for a

289
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,829
little bit later but the the screen or

290
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,510
the frame of graphics here<font color="#E5E5E5"> where's the</font>

291
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:53,510
see the untaped one

292
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,930
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ended up doing is who knows the</font>

293
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,340
difference between right<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading or well</font>

294
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,219
what is it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading in reverse</font>

295
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,720
image right<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading is when you look</font>

296
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,780
through the face of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can actually</font>

297
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">read the text as opposed to reversed at</font>

298
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,020
three o'clock in the morning I realized

299
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,760
it but the graphics for the speaker

300
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:16,160
shirt on backwards and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed them</font>

301
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,930
which means drawing you know cleaning

302
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,339
them re-- sensitizing him drawing him

303
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,400
and then shooting the image again which

304
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:28,490
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of fun yes very very good</font>

305
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,520
but well I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about actually when I</font>

306
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,660
looked at it this is you guys go oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

307
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,699
they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been cool i was looking</font>

308
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,740
at going i guess i could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on</font>

309
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the back and reverse and like I never</font>

310
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,860
met the graphic for this year with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

311
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bunny rabbit and everything was</font>

312
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,370
Jesus gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there what</font>

313
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,890
can it be huh we keep doing we keep

314
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,880
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go hey guess what so the next</font>

315
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,360
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've got a bunny rabbit</font>

316
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,960
with the ipod<font color="#E5E5E5"> it happens so you take the</font>

317
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">graphics in theory to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do right reading</font>

318
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you would put it on the face of the</font>

319
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,410
screen but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is you've got to</font>

320
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,420
expose the light through the screen so

321
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,610
what we end up doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> flipping it</font>

322
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:11,229
backwards laying the graphics on it in

323
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:14,390
reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exposing it that way now</font>

324
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,880
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen here i'm</font>

325
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,160
actually laying the piece of film on the

326
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,140
back side of it taping it down here's

327
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,230
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually did another project</font>

328
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the consortium</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the maker guys came up</font>

329
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and while they were shooting the bull</font>

330
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,900
was messing<font color="#E5E5E5"> around I actually went</font>

331
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,630
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and made an exposure frame it's</font>

332
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,600
a piece of glass<font color="#E5E5E5"> on just to stand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

333
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:38,810
is a 300 watt lamp let me tell you it's

334
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,430
extremely bright makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of heat but</font>

335
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:44,119
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way I've found actually</font>

336
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:46,370
exposed to screen no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually like</font>

337
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,620
a reflector with a medium base and a

338
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,390
huge light I've looked at halogen part

339
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:56,090
of the problem is the oil emulsion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

340
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,130
you're using is not only sensitive to

341
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,140
light but heat and if you don't watch it

342
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,750
the heat rising up through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

343
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually bake the emulsion solid before</font>

344
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,150
you ever get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the image on it</font>

345
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,859
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that out by putting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

346
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,110
over a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot light before and then</font>

347
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,460
standing in the shower spraying the

348
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,370
screen trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the image to come</font>

349
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,290
out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 45 minutes some things</font>

350
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,040
I've learned you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to take benefit of</font>

351
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,660
I take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exposure frame lay my screen</font>

352
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,750
on top of it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece of foam</font>

353
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:28,510
oddly enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got a yeah I</font>

354
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a picture of it I have like a</font>

355
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,020
dozen 12 volts 7 amp batteries of the

356
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,880
jail cells that are stacked up on top of

357
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing holding it flat putting</font>

358
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,890
pressure through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> foam against the</font>

359
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:43,240
glass so I get good contact you can see

360
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,090
from the flare coming off a little

361
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,640
reflector out there the lights on in boy

362
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,580
it's blowing your eyeballs out but I

363
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">will typically expose a screen like this</font>

364
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,930
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that distance between 23 and 30</font>

365
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
minutes depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how bored I am if</font>

366
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using vellum or something else that</font>

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,500
you know I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of mess with</font>

368
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the exposure I might cut it down and</font>

369
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,910
might leave it longer or something like

370
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,109
that it's not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a digital camera</font>

371
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:10,600
where you take a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gum in it</font>

372
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sucks he hit delete delete for me means</font>

373
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,420
spraying a chemical on removing the

374
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,860
emulsion letting it dry re sensitizing

375
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,360
it letting it dry shooting another

376
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,010
exposure so you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four or</font>

377
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,350
five hours to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

378
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:31,030
anything if you do screen printing if

379
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:32,860
you go to your local art supply store

380
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,630
and speed ball has a lot of like

381
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,520
beginners kits and things like that you

382
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually buy an emulsion similar</font>

383
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,790
this it's green it's really a pain to

384
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,070
wash out that's why I use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this pink</font>

385
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,170
color stuff but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

386
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,520
same process just<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a smaller scale so</font>

387
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,319
what I'm showing you doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

388
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to go spend a thousand dollars you</font>

389
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">can spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred bucks and be making</font>

390
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,280
t-shirts it just doesn't work as quick

391
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,520
as what I'm doing yeah there we go

392
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,480
that's so everything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point on</font>

393
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,920
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a live</font>

394
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,910
demonstration because you really

395
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,949
wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sit here for five hours</font>

396
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,790
father with a screen dry unless I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

397
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:11,980
serving alcohol um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah this is the</font>

398
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:14,879
shot of which he's not up yet this is al

399
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,790
myself in lady merlin consuming

400
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,709
dollars for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sushi at shmoocon early</font>

401
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,740
there is here I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a filler picture</font>

402
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,260
and I thought boy that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so I</font>

403
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,240
threw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that went up anyway she will kill</font>

404
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,870
the projector so I can move around if

405
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:48,210
you're not blind myself I'll drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

406
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:56,520
out so yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a an arc lamp and you</font>

407
00:17:48,210 --> 00:18:01,470
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use an arc lamp</font>

408
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,300
which is seriously tube together with a

409
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,010
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of electricity and create an arc</font>

410
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,000
it'll blow your eyeballs out if you're

411
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:13,230
not watching it in the printing industry

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,550
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I've looked at one before and it's</font>

413
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:19,260
a I'm sorry no I had no ill effects but

414
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,389
yeah you're actually your you can shoot

415
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,030
one in five minutes with enough light to

416
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,700
expose it but you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a 220</font>

417
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">volt device that you know carbon arcs</font>

418
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,550
it's really a pain in the ass to deal

419
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,960
with and someone who does it all the

420
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:36,300
time is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those set</font>

421
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:40,070
up so is that when they first

422
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:47,990
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> eastman kodak you came over</font>

423
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:47,990
yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you yeah yeah</font>

424
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,659
yeah you can a lot of those systems

425
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,610
would do refractive instead of

426
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,960
transmissive instead of laying something

427
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,540
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the screen you put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

428
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,940
flat base shot a lot of light at it and

429
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,649
then it came and was went through a lens

430
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,480
and went on to a backplane you had to

431
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,810
adjust everything just right to to

432
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually shoot an image that way um you</font>

433
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,919
could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way it was very</font>

434
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:23,920
difficult would take a while to actually

435
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,900
expose but it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so if you go</font>

436
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,970
to a full<font color="#E5E5E5"> size screen shot which I wish</font>

437
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,620
I had to is anybody got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaknik shirt</font>

438
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:35,050
on from last year that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't count um</font>

439
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:38,199
so the freaknik shirts if you haven't

440
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,419
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing white on a black</font>

441
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,030
shirt which is real simple to do the

442
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">freaknik shirts were nine process colors</font>

443
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,430
on a single shirt they had never done

444
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,960
nine process colors before they bought a

445
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,970
piece of software to be able to separate

446
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,350
the color out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll make James where</font>

447
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,530
his shirt later on tonight and check it

448
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,280
out but they literally took our image

449
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,230
which jigsaw did she hear no one showed

450
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,980
up to this talk anyway I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kidding</font>

451
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys um they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took the image and broke it</font>

452
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,840
down into nine separate color solid

453
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,780
colors and did each one of them on a 14

454
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,659
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen printing device so</font>

455
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,280
literally it's like one side of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

456
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,040
to the other and a huge wagon wheel

457
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,110
style and they set a shirt on it and a

458
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,210
device comes down and it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

459
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,399
screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it moves you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 degrees</font>

460
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,620
and does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this huge</font>

461
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,200
wheel that spins or two wheels that

462
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,729
spend I walk in and they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we</font>

463
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,200
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your job on come over here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

464
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,700
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these huge printing</font>

465
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,960
devices and I'm like now I'm going to

466
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,390
stand over here and look at this one for

467
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,060
a minute so they do this nine color

468
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,290
thing that I don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could</font>

469
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it work it had to have taken</font>

470
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,960
forever<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set it up but it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

471
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,190
nice kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a deal they've invested</font>

472
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,810
half a million dollars in all the

473
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,850
equipment they've got I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

474
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,620
thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm not making a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

475
00:20:54,850 --> 00:21:00,520
colors I can do a single one rather easy

476
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:02,949
but one of the reasons I wish al was in

477
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,400
here is we

478
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,140
we had a 4am conference one morning

479
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">after freaknik and we were talking about</font>

480
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,040
cons and putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on and he said</font>

481
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,040
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I really hate about doing</font>

482
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,659
a kind and I said not being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

483
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,899
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and he said no no</font>

484
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,670
no no no he said doing the t-shirts he

485
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,580
said you either have a design that

486
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:27,730
everybody wants can they disappear and

487
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,740
you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough or you print a ton</font>

488
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,780
of them and everyone goes yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like it</font>

489
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you're stuck with them so I</font>

490
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,290
have a drawer at home that's full of

491
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,020
t-shirts from other you know from from

492
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,879
the cons of done in the past am I just

493
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,280
think give those away I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so</font>

494
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,170
you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with like handfuls of</font>

495
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,970
t-shirts that you know no one wants at

496
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,130
that point because it's you know the

497
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,410
cons gone the magic isn't there anymore

498
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,060
what are you going to do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

499
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,940
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do</font>

500
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:56,590
we're going to print for shirts and the

501
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,000
first four people get those shirts will

502
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,740
sell them for 200 bucks or something but

503
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,750
screw this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sucks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trending you know</font>

504
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,750
what do you do with all the shirts and I

505
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:08,080
said an idea i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would just print him at</font>

506
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,480
the kind and he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you do that</font>

507
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,610
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i mean i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

508
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,590
equipment so ya won't we print them at

509
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,149
the con so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font>

510
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,370
t-shirt blanks in here in different

511
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,140
sizes so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can print whatever I</font>

512
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,790
want the trouble is once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put the ink</font>

513
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,080
on there it doesn't wash out you can't

514
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,610
use the shirt for anything else other

515
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,740
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> wash the car and it's kind of</font>

516
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,780
expensive so what we're actually going

517
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,250
to do is set the full rig up and I'm

518
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,840
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a t-shirt and then from</font>

519
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,070
that point on if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to t-shirt</font>

520
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,290
we're actually going to print them right

521
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,909
here while you're you know eating pizza

522
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,710
and everything you can come up we'll

523
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,920
silkscreen one now they're 15 bucks a

524
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,350
pop so that's basically to pay for the

525
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,680
shirt themselves and he'll help fund the

526
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,629
con I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm not going</font>

527
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,640
on a vacation in the Bahamas after this

528
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,350
conference is over my goal is to break

529
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,490
even so yeah I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> J</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're so what</font>

530
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,740
we're going to do set it up and actually

531
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,950
make everything happen and if you want a

532
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,950
shirt

533
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:24,820
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do Backman the the big</font>

534
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:26,379
one of the print<font color="#E5E5E5"> there well while I'm</font>

535
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,979
actually putting this on here will tell

536
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:32,198
a few tales they're the first outer zone

537
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:38,679
does anyone have a badge from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

538
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:43,719
outer zone yeah we I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> being very</font>

539
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:51,339
politically correct sorry it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Italian</font>

540
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:54,339
um what we what we hint hit I'm never

541
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:56,859
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live that one down ever it</font>

542
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:59,889
became one of those hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

543
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:01,389
graphics for the badge and occasionally

544
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:03,279
I have a lapse in judgment and think

545
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:04,899
it's a good idea to do something and and

546
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,940
I go ahead with it and then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

547
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:09,849
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bite me later on and sort of</font>

548
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:13,749
some karmic way so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put on</font>

549
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:15,639
the back of every badge some not exactly

550
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:19,779
sign language but some line art and it

551
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:22,418
literally was or no what was it was

dollar commercially available screen

620
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,409
printing single color rig which works

621
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,210
does a great job I've done ton<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

622
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,670
t-shirts with it one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

623
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,800
when you hang a 20 x 24 screen off the

624
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,720
end of there's enough weight on it that

625
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,010
the screen will fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically when you</font>

626
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,930
put a squeegee in a bunch of ink and

627
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,400
everything on it the last thing you want

628
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,920
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it to fall while you're working</font>

629
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,630
on it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put a two and a half pound</font>

630
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,490
barbell weight on the tail<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of it</font>

631
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:58,440
it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a magnet but I threw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

632
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,700
there to be able to sort of

633
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,420
counterbalance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and keep it in</font>

634
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">position so necessity is a mother</font>

635
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,510
apparently that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one came</font>

636
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,510

638
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,250
tells you what you do and don't want to

639
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:26,909
do when it comes to dealing with the

640
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry this is an $11 Inc spatula but</font>

squeegees you don't want to scrimp on

649
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,120

656
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,000

657
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,260
ink through the screen either so I've

658

674
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,460
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> situations this is actually</font>

675
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,110
what's on the black t-shirt I call it

676
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,180
nuclear baby because if you ever

677
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:09,990
had a kid before and you've changed a

678
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,720
diaper its its its nuclear baby in

679
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,360
velcro it goes everywhere if you get a

680
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,500
single dot of it on your finger

681
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,360
everything you touch for a good hour

682
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,059
we'll have a dot on it and so you find

683
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,820
it and wipe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your finger</font>

684
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:29,320
you got safe so the fun part about this

685
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff is it does not set up I mean if</font>

you leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in the open it will the</font>

687
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:36,158
chemical carrier that's in it will

688
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:37,570
actually dissipate but the white stuff

689
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,340
that's left behind will do the exact

690
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,499
same thing it transfers everywhere so

691
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,459

the consortium because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tillman bought</font>

700
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,729
him for something we were working on

701
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:20,739
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i had to snag him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

702
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,700
thought Tillman bought a hen fo god I

703
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to know what he bought these</font>

704
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,200
for but he bought like a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

705
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:31,629
them so I only do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> during this</font>

706
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,210
portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it because like I say once</font>

707
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:37,959
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some of this on you it goes a</font>

708
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,809
long long way so it doesn't cure by

709
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:44,799
oxidation meaning if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out in</font>

710
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:49,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun it doesn't doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> overtime</font>

711
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually dry it cures more than just</font>

712
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:55,178
that's going to look good it cares by

713
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,850
heat alone so I can move this stuff all

714
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,379
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place and it'll stay tacky and</font>

715
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">crappy anything until I hit it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

716
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:05,109
heat gun then it becomes like<font color="#E5E5E5"> rubber if</font>

717
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,179
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the shirt you have on if you</font>

718
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:10,269
have one with white ink and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> stretch</font>

719
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:12,369
it stretch just a little bit what you'll

720
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:16,029
find is the ink actually stretches with

721
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:21,970
the shirt that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plastisol inc which</font>

722
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:23,619
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm using here the if you have</font>

723
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,179
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done with acrylic it</font>

724
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:26,830
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like that</font>

725
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,770
we'll just kind of shred and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

726
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">crap from that point on um</font>

727
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:44,260
so what I'm going to do sometimes it

728
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:50,350
takes you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what do you</font>

729
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:51,910
being picky yeah it's the when we

730
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:57,429
transported this it got moved around

731
00:32:51,910 --> 00:33:05,980
sure guy in the front rowing is gonna be

732
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:07,750
a pain in the ass you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's if</font>

733
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:12,070
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it before you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's real</font>

734
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:15,220
easy to waste a few of them actually you

735
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,909
know what I didn't I didn't shoot this

736
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,920
or do this graphic prior so it's

737
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,830
entirely possible yeah it's just at the

738
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,710
end it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> largest graphic I've ever</font>

739
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,220
done because of the amount of names had

740
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,220
to put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

741
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,210
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to put a little bit of</font>

742
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,490
adhesive on to let it sit for a minute

743
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:45,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to run down on t-shirts you can</font>

744
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:48,129
spend seven dollars a t-shirt and buy

745
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,139
some really really nice t-shirts but

746
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:52,840
they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that much</font>

747
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:56,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">different from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff i</font>

748
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,939
can buy a fruit of the Loom shirt for

749
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:00,519
three or four dollars if i buy a couple

750
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,019
cases of them so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to buy</font>

751
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,690
the most expensive shirt out there to

752
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:08,379
get a nice t-shirt what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

753
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:12,099
is I take my t-shirt and lay it onto the

754
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:13,629
platen and I jiggle it around I'll show

755
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:17,980
you this more when you come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

756
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:20,049
it out and quite literally I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick</font>

757
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:24,219
it down to the platen the platen is the

758
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:25,809
wooden piece underneath here yeah I

759
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't stretching I just basically I'm</font>

760
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:32,050
temporarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> gluing it down to the</font>

761
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:34,089
surface so once I've done that the

762
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:38,319
t-shirts not going to go anywhere the

763
00:34:34,089 --> 00:34:40,599
nice thing about that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

764
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:42,460
black ink on a white shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes one</font>

765
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,159
pass to do that when you put white ink

766
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,369
on a black shirt it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> one maybe two</font>

767
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,079
passes trust me when you put fluorescent

768
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:56,520
orange ink on the black shirt it takes

769
00:34:50,079 --> 00:35:01,420
five passes and it's no fun do what oh

770
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:05,810
it's not no no

771
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,380
so once i get my ink in here i'm just

772
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work it up a little bit and</font>

773
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:14,720
like I say nuclear baby should people

774
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:19,279
the one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

775
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:22,490
deal with t-shirt wise and graphic wise

776
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:34,040
is hey decode what kind of what size

777
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:38,089
shirt do we wear yeah I I wear a triple

778
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:42,620
or quad XL shirt all right the problem

779
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:44,660
with that is they don't make unix admin

780
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:46,670
shirts very small they're always big

781
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,029
guys but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have programmers and those</font>

782
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:53,390
 were small and medium shirts

783
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:58,360
when you put a 10 x 13 image onto a

784
00:35:53,390 --> 00:36:01,279
shirt like that I'm going that's true

785
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,290
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that eat that</font>

786
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">one real quick when you do something</font>

787
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,950
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you have an image that's</font>

788
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,589
10 x 13<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a guy who's wearing a small</font>

789
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,330
shirt it covers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire back for me I</font>

790
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,240
got a billboard back here I can put

791
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:18,290
whatever I want eat it Jose you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

792
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,299
what's the one Joe's Bar and Grill

793
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,730
Pasadena California open 24 hours a day

794
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,490
I mean yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got plenty of space on my</font>

795
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,740
back to put an image so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

796
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,000
when you create graphics to do on a

797
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,439
shirt you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

798
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,940
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look good on a small shirt as</font>

799
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,140
it's going to look on a large shirt or

800
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:38,450
triple XL see you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AXA loot maximum</font>

801
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,759
size you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is 10 x 13 which</font>

802
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:44,029
unfortunately is the size I've got to do

803
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,580
here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> total is doing my assistant</font>

804
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,680
here is he is heat curing the first

805
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:54,680
 up shirt I've done for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

806
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,870
I typically will lay down some just

807
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,730
newsprint stock and run the first shirt

808
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,680
through because I've got to push all

809
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:05,120
this ink across the screen and for the

810
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:08,399
print and in doing so it doesn't do a

811
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:12,140
great job on the

812
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,670
first one there we go sounds like I was

813
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">ranked one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out hit that again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll pull</font>

814
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:24,420
so what he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically doing it on high</font>

815
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:27,150
he's got a 1500 watt heat gun it is

816
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,650
entirely possible to cook the top of the

817
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:31,350
shirt with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heat gun if you keep it</font>

818
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:34,950
too slow you can also set the ink on

819
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,870
fire I've done that one um I have held a

820
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:41,790
shirt in my hand and said oh that's a

821
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:43,980
little tacky and burned by hand so I'll

822
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:49,100
do it I'll do another one once we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

823
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,100
this set kind of show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what's up the</font>

824
00:37:49,520 --> 00:38:02,040
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you sorry okay yes yeah</font>

825
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:05,490
that is another one of the fun things

826
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,060
about another one of the fun things with

827
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,060
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

828
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:16,868
one piece per person so yeah the pizza's

829
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:19,000
here if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind one piece per</font>

830
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:20,920
person until everyone gets one and

831
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and then leave a piece for me</font>

00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:52,359
inch if I put enough deflection on it

840
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,000
you can actually see the screw heads

841
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:57,190
down here<font color="#E5E5E5"> move trust me this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

842
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bane of my existence because when</font>

843
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,539
you lay down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen you simulate the</font>

844
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:04,029
screen and pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeegee forward I'm</font>

845
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,890
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful not to put any side to side</font>

846
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:07,299
pressure because it literally will move

847
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,160
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> while you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making the print</font>

848
00:39:07,299 --> 00:39:10,450
which if you're doing black and white

849
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,399
shirts not that big of a deal because

850
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you pull it off and hey looks great but</font>

851
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,900
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to register dot for</font>

852
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,129
dot line for line on to a shirt yeah

853
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:27,480
it's kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pain in the ass to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

854
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:31,119
him hit this right now hit this more<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

855
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:36,460
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other projects I look at</font>

856
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,380
it this way my father taught<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that why</font>

857
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,029
pay somebody to do something for you if

858
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,440
you can do it yourself hence the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

859
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:44,859
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people are actually in this</font>

860
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,599
room so I could have built this rig but

861
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,788
it was easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy this</font>

862
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:50,859
piece and build all the other pieces

863
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:52,599
around it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to take</font>

864
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:55,680
me a fair amount of trial and error to

865
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:58,329
get something precise how much was this

866
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,480
250 bucks how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

867
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,480

870
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,400
spend the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of my talk putting</font>

871
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:14,440
money in that bucket up front yeah I

872
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,910

875
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,029
well not the stuff that led up to the

876
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:28,269
4am conference but the hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

877
00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:29,950
we do shirts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons so you said why</font>

878
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:32,529
we do a donation-based con every year

879
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:36,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">bucker here it is sure to the con here</font>

880
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:39,069
it is hey boy we need to take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

881
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:42,549
world give me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whiteboard I've got</font>

882
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:47,380
to figure this one out yeah that's a

883
00:40:42,549 --> 00:40:52,480
good yeah there you go well if I could

884
00:40:47,380 --> 00:41:00,130
pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> that off um 500 for the just for</font>

885
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:02,769
this I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I paid five hundred</font>

886
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,059
dollars for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it depends on what</font>

887
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:09,160
you buying who you get it from some

888
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:11,519
there the when you go to do a shirt like

889
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,819
this we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> used a heat gun to</font>

890
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:17,140
temporarily set the ink the reason I say

891
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:19,599
temporarily set the ink because if I

892
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,000
threw this in the washer right now 23

893
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,140
I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the South washer if I ran it</font>

894
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,420
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wash two or three times</font>

895
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:27,038
eventually the text would start coming

896
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,250
off of because I haven't actually said

897
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,230
the ink if i take my cute little pinkies

898
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,730
and pull things back and forth you can

899
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,200
see the graphics kind of stretch a

900
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,509
little bit but if i give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good pull</font>

901
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,009
you'll see a break happen in the ink and

902
00:41:37,509 --> 00:41:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">it basically from that point on goes</font>

903
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:43,539
downhill so what I do is I make it work

904
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:46,779
I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get any baby</font>

905
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:48,099
 on my hands so my father said well

906
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:50,650
why would you do something like that

907
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">just make your own so here's the</font>

908
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">five-hundred-dollar flash dryer if you</font>

909
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:59,879
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine this is a seven dollar</font>

910
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:03,069
toaster and $12 quarter sheet pan and

911
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:07,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">just what a quarter sheet pan is good</font>

912
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:09,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we're oh so do what does it</font>

913
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:10,640
actually by the end of the con we can

914
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:15,920
make it run linux

915
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:18,019
um what what I ended up doing is I said

916
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,809
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to pay 500</font>

917
00:42:18,019 --> 00:42:22,368
bucks for a dryer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm only going to</font>

918
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">use here and there if I fire it up and</font>

919
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:25,099
start doing a lot of t-shirts and the

920
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,890
consortium members are probably going to

921
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:29,839
do this soon I'll go pay 250 to 500

922
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,190
dollars for a dryer but for the most

923
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,819
part I'm just going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

924
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:36,369
happen so this is one of those Jesus I

925
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:39,319
hope it doesn't fry something I

926
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:41,900
literally disassembled a toaster and

927
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,440
took the heating pieces out the nichrome

928
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,839
and the the mica plates that it uses to

929
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,660
insulate everything and retrofitted it

930
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:55,099
to a electrically conductive quarter

931
00:42:50,660 --> 00:43:00,230
sheet pan trust me yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it</font>

932
00:42:55,099 --> 00:43:02,059
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> void</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me if you know how that goes no</font>

933
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,130
no that's why it's electrically isolated

934
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:06,319
by this switch that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

935
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:11,329
touch metal on when I flip<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on now it</font>

936
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,250
will it's actually Tom Jesus<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't touch</font>

937
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,480
this actually I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get mud</font>

938
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,279
flap to stand over here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it</font>

939
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,460
because you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I can trust</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

940
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so what I ended up doing I took those</font>

941
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,619
plates out I took some<font color="#CCCCCC"> long screws and</font>

942
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:26,480
some nylon spacers and actually space

943
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,700
the plates out once we're done i'll show

944
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,299
you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it set up and everything</font>

945
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,939
but I make the the actual dryer Pete or

946
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:38,359
toaster pieces standoff or they wouldn't

947
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,240
touch anything the problem is nylon does

948
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:43,670
burn to set the ink on one of these

949
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,970
shirts it's 320 degrees for about 30

950
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,680
seconds so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately nylon does burn</font>

951
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:51,529
at anything above two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some</font>

952
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,328
odd so while we're running it you'll go

953
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">God what is that smell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's this</font>

954
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:58,549
burning<font color="#CCCCCC"> up but you know don't worry</font>

955
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that I'm not touching it so so I</font>

956
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:02,869
built this system basically to be able

957
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do what I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and I've got</font>

958
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:09,170
like 40 bucks in it so what can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

959
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:11,839
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll end up doing is is adjusting</font>

960
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:15,140
this height wise so that I can burn the

961
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">top of the table here at the hotel don't</font>

962
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:22,049
don't tell anybody but

963
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:23,490
yeah what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do is set it just</font>

964
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,160
above the table height about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

965
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">inches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw a shirt down and cook</font>

966
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,700
it I mean cure it with this thing and

967
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:34,410
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that the think and everything</font>

968
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,960
should be set and shouldn't be a problem

969
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:42,390
at all until I figure out why that won't

970
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,610
move I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what we'll do</font>

971
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,100
is we'll peel back the drapery on the

972
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,390
edge everybody got pizza yet you can

973
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,339
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get pizza it's not</font>

974
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:55,140
going to morally offend me a few yes

975
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,920
total is the whipping boy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell you one</font>

976
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:02,879
he he kept up with me during<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaknik I</font>

977
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,850

or something similar bend over because

1073
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,110
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be expensive you have to</font>

1074
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,180
buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chemicals to develop the film</font>

they have an expiration date on and you

1076
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,950
have to keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine clean or you</font>

1077
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,180
buy mylar run it to a laser printer the

1078
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,560
only problem with running mylar through

1079
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,440
laser printer what does laser printer

1080
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,960
use heat

1081
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,800
uses very high heat when you're on mylar

1082
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,720
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high heat it does stories the</font>

1083
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,190
toner that you put on there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> dark</font>

1084
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,480
enough so you have to print two of them

1085
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,740
lay them over the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of each other and</font>

1086
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,930
guess what when you destroy two pieces

1087
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,759
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic they don't register so you</font>

1088
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,370
get kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little jaggies that stick on</font>

1089
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:43,680
everywhere so that doesn't work now I've

1090
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:45,960
seen do way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jooste smidgen the the</font>

1091
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,330
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear mylar with the ancient on</font>

1092
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,250
there doesn't distort because there's no

1093
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,230
heat involved but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite dark</font>

1094
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,540
enough or opaque enough to be able to

1095
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:56,040
use exactly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was using here so you</font>

1096
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,230
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to print two copies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lay over each</font>

1097
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,880
other then you get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing where</font>

1098
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,930
the mylar actually resist some of the

1099
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,850
light going through and you have to

1100
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">change your exposure literally it's like</font>

1101
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,600
play around with it for a while you can

1102
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,250
go by eight and a half by 11 sheets to

1103
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,799
run through an inkjet printer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

1104
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:12,870
this stuff at home literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't raise their hand can see why they</font>

1117
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:45,810
need one on the account where it was

1118
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:49,710
until I was interrupted by the guy in

1119
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:52,950
the front row um know if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey</font>

1121
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:57,120

1122
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:58,290
shirts how's that because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

1123
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,660
time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes me to get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font>

1124
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:02,460
set up and going and clean it up to do

1125
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,470
one shirt it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you 500</font>

1126
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,560
bucks but if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make you a</font>

1127
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:09,450
dozen of them they're not that expensive

1128
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,049
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want a shirt you go to Cafe Press</font>

1129
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:15,560
and make it happen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so what I'm</font>

1130
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,560
going to do

1131
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:29,069
is do it it has to get 320 degrees for

1132
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:31,289
30 seconds to actually set<font color="#CCCCCC"> the image and</font>

1133
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:34,440
if you don't set it you'll find that it

1134
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:36,599
doesn't work worth a damn later on so I

1135
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,789
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found anything other than using</font>

1136
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:45,359
direct heat like this it will cure one

1137
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:49,230
properly the shirt that I have passed

1138
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,880
around is just one image on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1139
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,440
they don't going to put this you know

1140
00:52:50,880 --> 00:53:00,240
what tip that went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lay it on</font>

1141
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:01,950
top of them yeah that's that's that

1142
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,149
works but that's definitely not

1143
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:07,950
something that works well production

1144
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:13,369
wise that's yeah yes question in the

1145
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:13,368
back sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> howdy question in the back</font>

1146
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,140
you

1147
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:50,099
you really you can shoot one in 35 or 40

1148
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:50,099
seconds is that carbon arc Jesus

1149
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:02,020
nice the the only thing that I've ever

1150
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,849
worried about well I've worried about a

1151
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,200
couple things with using halogen like

1152
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:07,000
that it's the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of heat it creates</font>

1153
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,790
so then you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a horizontal</font>

1154
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,079
system and a vacuum frame because if you

1155
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:14,529
do it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cook</font>

1156
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,180
your your emulsion but also I guess for

1157
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:18,220
30 seconds you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't walk out and watch</font>

1158
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:33,819
the meter spin while you turn that thing

1159
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if anyone wants a t-shirt you</font>

1161
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:47,140

1162
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:53,319
doing is taping off the screen because

1163
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:56,078
i'm lazy bastard it's a low tack yeah

1164
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:58,900

1165
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,369

peel<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off it comes off in a heartbeat</font>

1167
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:03,970

1168
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:09,550
you need it to either but it's what they

1169
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:12,640
end up using the mass clangs off it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>
