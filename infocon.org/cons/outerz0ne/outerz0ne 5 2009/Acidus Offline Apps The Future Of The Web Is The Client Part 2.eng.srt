1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
after not it was like no no you didn't

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,040
enter a valid coupon code and so it

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,039
turns out what happened is that inside

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,150
of JavaScript they had a big list of md5

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,280
hashes now what they were doing is they

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,710
were taking oh oh no it gets worse so

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you typed in is your coupon</font>

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,090
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's maybe i typed in you know</font>

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,490
Billy so I typed in Billy it took

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,859
whatever you typed in uppercase tit

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,278
removed everything that wasn't letters

12
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,040
or numbers md5 did and then compare it

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,690
with the list at hat so what this means

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,640
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only do I have a list of all</font>

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,129
known hashes but I know how they

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,960
constructed the input so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

17
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,790
hacker when<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,010
John the Ripper I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell it to</font>

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,710
generate all<font color="#E5E5E5"> English words that are only</font>

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,480
uppercase and go ahead add letters so

21
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,739
they drastically reduced the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key space</font>

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,010
the number of things I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,750
generate and see basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I don't</font>

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,489
who here knows hashing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what hash</font>

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,949
functions are some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so I</font>

26
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,899
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask hashing is like having</font>

27
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,750
hamburger meat and trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the cow looked like you can't but</font>

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,630
what you do you have a lot of farm

30
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,700
animals you can throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all through</font>

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:13,320
the grinder and see what looks most like

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,220
hamburger means the thing that looks

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,839
like hamburger meat was probably a cat

34
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,100
so the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing he went ahead and said</font>

35
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,330
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> english dictionary</font>

36
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,460
I'm gonna run through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hashing</font>

37
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,650
function and anything that matches I

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,630
can't go backwards but because i went

39
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,659
for words<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know what that word was and</font>

40
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,460
so within about five seconds he cracked

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,770
all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sure enough there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,449
lovely thing called platinum pass which

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,908
would give you a platinum pass to

44
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Macworld free of charge a platinum pass</font>

45
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,820
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macworld</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost ship out in nineteen</font>

46
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,490
hundred dollars so he cracked this 2008

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,720
same thing you did it again so I really

48
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,579
well actually they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">world this year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve job so that's</font>

50
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess actually I won't be able to do</font>

51
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:04,110
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

52
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:05,340
oh yeah exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so needless to say I</font>

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:10,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought this story was funny as hell</font>

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,690
until my friend in in late two thousand

55
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,520
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vinny emailed me so there's a good</font>

56
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">friend of my guy named Vinnie Lou he</font>

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,480
runs a consulting company called stack

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,670
and Lou so if you ever need code review

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,810
or something great guy so this was right

60
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,910
we got bought by HP in spring<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2007 so</font>

61
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been an employee of HP</font>

62
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,820
now for a little while though I'm sure

63
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,750
with all this drinking they're really

64
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,750
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want me to admit that</font>

65
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:41,900
that's right compaq yes well actually

66
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,670
deck if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back so um</font>

67
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vinny sends me this email goes I don't</font>

68
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,230
know who to send this to but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

69
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,390
user conference every year and he said

70
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">look I went to the user conference and</font>

71
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,450
to register because Vinny was going to

72
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,700
be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our speakers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

73
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,739
automated code review and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

74
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,839
you know I noticed the application was

75
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,060
responding way too fast to my discount

76
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,230
code and I'm like this sounds familiar

77
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,760
so he goes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he opens up the</font>

78
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript codes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the check occurs</font>

79
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,109
at javascript something<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody but trivial</font>

80
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,060
might be some a pelagic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm missing</font>

81
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,959
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can prevent it I didn't bother to</font>

82
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,790
check hope all<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well tours video it's</font>

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,910
so now you'll notice this was at three

84
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,500
thirty at night and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went I started</font>

85
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,420
looking and sure enough in the Dhamma

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,630
script code I saw something it's a

87
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,518
discount code zero discount code<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

88
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">got so it's like the code the name the</font>

89
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,500
amount the code of the day the amount so

90
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:39,060
ignore the amount and the obvious

91
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">client-side pricing problem there I'm</font>

92
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,470
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt first of all you'll notice</font>

93
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,030
that the discount code here looks a lot

94
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,830
like the discount code here which looks

95
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,420
a lot like the district in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact these</font>

96
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,730
guys only differ by a single character

97
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">now anybody who does anything with</font>

98
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,200
cryptography will tell you that

99
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,120
cryptography supposed to be random so if

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,518
I give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the word cat it should</font>

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,980
encrypt to some crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> gible of numbers</font>

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if I give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the word hat the word</font>

103
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,880
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gible of numbers that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font>

104
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">you look nothing like cat they should be</font>

105
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that these</font>

106
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,240
are so similar there are patterns

107
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,519
indicates a problem this is a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

108
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,450
bad cryptography so I'm like oh man this

109
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,730
is a good oh I went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

110
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,860
found a function inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript</font>

111
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was called crypt that would take in</font>

112
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,800
the string and basically shift around

113
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:32,560
the ASCII characters which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

114
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,750
this guy and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy the code is</font>

115
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,550
probably the same with just one letter

116
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,150
being different and that's why there's a

117
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:43,240
pattern so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly wrote a pretty</font>

118
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,310
got worse because it was reversible so I

119
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,630
very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrote something that dumped</font>

120
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,370
out all the promo codes so and then I

121
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">said I basically send a screenshot which</font>

122
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,560
ended with fire or external web

123
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">excavation what ! now here's a problem</font>

124
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,690
is that so we we set up this website for

125
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically see who the speakers</font>

126
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,690
were you know all this stuff you know I

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there rob was there and then we</font>

128
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,840
determined wait a minute we've never

129
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,960
wrote the code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did the</font>

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,330
checkout process so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it our code</font>

131
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,750
it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conference provider use</font>

132
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,490
this code for everyone so they they

133
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,170
basically you could say all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here's</font>

134
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,000
the conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing but to register</font>

135
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,880
and do all the shopping cart stuff it

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,770
used the same code well needless to say

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,570
we immediately started searching this

138
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,789
conference page to find out what other

139
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,790
conferences they hosted it turns out

140
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,130
that they were hosting the if everybody

141
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,650
ever goes out to Vegas sometimes either

142
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,810
Def Con or black hat overlaps with the

143
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,590
adult film festival conference it goes

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting too I like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call this</font>

173

story Billy wins a cheeseburger and

174
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:05,349
you'll see why in a moment so we were

175
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:07,748
playing this there was a restaurant very

176
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:11,709
famous restaurants you all have gone

177
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:14,979
there it's got freaky clowns anyway so

178
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:17,409
they every<font color="#E5E5E5"> year do a game after a very</font>

179
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:21,099
famous board games were<font color="#CCCCCC"> you buying sell</font>

180
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,719
property and potentially some utilities

181
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:26,649
but the utilities don't pay out as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

182
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,879
as the railroads so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this thing</font>

183
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:30,039
so you could play in the storm and

184
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,979
Ferraris and stuff or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font>

185
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">play online in this flash version and if</font>

186
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:38,139
you won it would give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you coupons for</font>

187
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:41,378
free food<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right sexy awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm all</font>

188
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:43,059
about free stuff so we went ahead we

189
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,069
started playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this game and we</font>

190
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:47,110
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only time this flash</font>

191
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,869
thing running in the browser actually

192
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,929
sent a message to the web server was

193
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:56,169
when you won and we notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even if</font>

194
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:57,549
you won the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same prize it sent a</font>

195
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,709
different message we're like okay this

196
00:07:57,549 --> 00:08:01,688
is kind of weird so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we</font>

197
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:03,980
did is try to replay the message but it

198
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">did it work so we're like</font>

199
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,720
that really sucks so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we</font>

200
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,520
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is said let's decompile the flash</font>

201
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
object now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you this in a</font>

202
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,510
second actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the tool that may</font>

203
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,330
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> may not be released for free by the</font>

204
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,360
end of the month<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all will see</font>

205
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,950
so we decompile this thing and we very

206
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,870
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize what the app was doing</font>

207
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:27,729
it was taking your email address the

208
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,720
prize you won and the time/date stamp

209
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,180
encrypting that and sending it to the

210
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">web server this is why if i won the same</font>

211
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,199
prize twice it changed because the

212
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,539
time/date stamp was different and what

213
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,270
they were doing is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i won at</font>

214
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,890
noon on friday if i tried to replay the

215
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:45,530
message five minutes later it would say

216
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,060
no wait a minute this<font color="#E5E5E5"> message that you</font>

217
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,819
should have won this five minutes ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

218
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,729
way your clock is that out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync no no</font>

219
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,040
and it would deny you so we very quickly

220
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,770
wrote a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new game Oh what's in that</font>

221
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:04,040
am I gonna want to drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> that vodka and</font>

222
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:06,050
almost wrecked cool oh yes so if they

223
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,300
allow for<font color="#CCCCCC"> clutched you you could replay</font>

224
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,949
something within an hour that was not a

225
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,449
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oh my lord it's poked it I have a</font>

226
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,620
feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this story is going to end</font>

227
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,620
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's how I got hepatitis</font>

228
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,840
so and it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all this time</font>

229
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:32,670
that's another story so we we decided to

230
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,020
go ahead and write a new game and this

231
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,780
game was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called Billy wins a</font>

232
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,699
cheeseburger because by decompiling the

233
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,620
game where you win a lot of property

234
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,750
what was inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that was the</font>

235
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,370
encryption key<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we had the encryption</font>

236
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,290
key and we have the logic to make the

237
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,210
message that it got sent to say look

238
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,520
Billy just wanted cheeseburger or some

239
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,250
fries or whatever so we went ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> built</font>

240
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,860
a new flash game and all it had was a

241
00:09:53,250 --> 00:10:02,720
big red button and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you pushed it and you</font>

242
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,370
love it you pushed it again if you won

243
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> greatest game ever now of course</font>

244
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,350
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob and I have a co-worker</font>

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,120
work with a gal named projecta actually

246
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,480
at one point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> our research team</font>

247
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,700
was half female<font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian and vegetarian</font>

248
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,900
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way anymore we've hired</font>

249
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:25,410
more folks but we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two fantastically</font>

250
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,260
look almost unheard of i know so um

251
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,270
anyway for projecto we decided to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

252
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,130
revision to of<font color="#E5E5E5"> billy wins a cheeseburger</font>

253
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,110
which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a drop-down of what you</font>

254
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,410
would win because she had no interest in

255
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">having hamburgers so and it also project</font>

256
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,980
is great because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to have on</font>

257
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fridays we would do like a friday lunch</font>

258
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,020
and all them basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the managers</font>

259
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,819
because I run<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research group it</font>

260
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,680
would round robin between who had to go

261
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead and find a vendor for lunch and it</font>

262
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,400
got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and protectors like Billy you</font>

263
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,350
got to get something everybody else does

264
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,579
BBQ and they pretty salad so the

265
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,130
vegetarians have something she's like

266
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,690
salad is not something you can eat every

267
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,050
day she's like salad it's not an

268
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,640
acceptable food so she think I learned

269
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,719
yeah which unfortunately is the only

270
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,970
thing you could get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this restaurant</font>

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,100
that have the property game but that was

272
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,450
vegetarian I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure other stuff</font>

273
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,450
was vegetarian but I mean

274
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,319
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you another real-life</font>

275
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,910
example I blurred this but we had

276
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,670
another guy we work with named Ray Kelly

277
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,439
who I don't know who's looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a job</font>

278
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,229
there's a company here local Atlanta

279
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,090
called pure wire which<font color="#E5E5E5"> does web security</font>

280
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,440
kinda in the cloud really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool company</font>

281
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,900
started by a bunch of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cipher trust</font>

282
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,850
guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly suggest looking at it</font>

283
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,470
we we since being bought by HP is

284
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,440
actually lost a lot of our really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

285
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,270
smart people to HP or excuse me to pure

286
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,570
wire which shows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm obviously not</font>

287
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:49,030
very smart or brightest i'm still<font color="#E5E5E5"> at HP</font>

288
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,880
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> raehwan turn right way into pure</font>

289
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,620
wire now ray like to play a lot of poker

290
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,900
and the grant thing was his race sucked

291
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,180
at poker so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try stuff</font>

292
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:01,270
online so there was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one free online</font>

293
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,550
poker place and just on a whim kind of

294
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:05,400
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob's presentation earlier he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

295
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,750
just at this website and typed admin

296
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,550
into you know he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at sitecom whatever</font>

297
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,520
typed in admin got this page and were

298
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,589
like wow that's that's kind of sexy well

299
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,199
we noticed when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the source</font>

300
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,570
of the page that the advan thing was

301
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a swift</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baka we're like wait a</font>

302
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,990
minute that's this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

303
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,140
it says usually a min password and login

304
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,770
that's not HTML it's a swift file<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

305
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,750
flash application so we went ahead and

306
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,819
visited directly and sure enough it took

307
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,250
up the whole screen just like a flash up

308
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:40,720
would so we used elite hacking tool

309
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:43,390
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> w gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

310
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,970
after our<font color="#CCCCCC"> W get is essentially you say</font>

311
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,650
here's a URL whatever's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there just</font>

312
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,020
downloading save it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

313
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,870
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> W get is sometimes browsers if you</font>

314
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,810
go file save as if it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

315
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,250
not HTML but kind of gum it up most of

316
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,989
these bugs are fixed but we wanted to

317
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure we actually got the flash</font>

318
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,480
application now we used a lovely little

319
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,260
tool called flare flare is an

320
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,140
open-source decompiler for flash now it

321
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,280
only works on flash 8 and below we'll

322
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,930
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why that's important in a</font>

323
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,760
moment but it's I love it you just

324
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-click and say decompile now the</font>

325
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,970
source code what this app was actually

326
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing I saw simply said look if they</font>

327
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,819
press the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enter button</font>

328
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:29,180
if the username field says n<font color="#CCCCCC"> log and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

329
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:33,498

330
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,910
them to admin home you know shtml so

331
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:38,329
they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> checking the</font>

332
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,160
credentials at the client number one

333

rule of web securities you cannot trust

334
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,389
the client so<font color="#E5E5E5"> needless to say not only</font>

335
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:46,279
were they checking the username and

336
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:48,439
password they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

337
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,439
here's the lovely<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing this is not an</font>

338
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:52,998
isolated incident we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead Dennis</font>

339
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:55,730
charge here some other flash code we'd

340
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,949
be decompiled on release or enter if

341
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,139
user name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this and password is secure</font>

342
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:04,040
i love the way their password is secure

343
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:06,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five four three we</font>

344
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually went ahead this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not so</font>

345
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't know why you can see this but</font>

346
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:13,220
you know login password equals camps you

347
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:15,589
know these are multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites we</font>

the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> is logging or secure admin you</font>

353
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,610
end up getting only<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 200 or so</font>

354
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:35,839
results well it turned out of those 150

355
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:38,089
results 23 of them had login credentials

356
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard-coated so I mean this is a very</font>

357
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,319
just one particular sample but you're

358
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at I mean I've just been</font>

359
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,360
drinking rum and whatever this green

360
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:50,179
hepatitis stuff is but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's at least</font>

361
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,379
it's more than ten percent less than

362
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,110
five percent let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fifteen</font>

363
00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:57,439
percent fifteen percent of all flash

364
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,749
apps related to logins or secure or

365
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:03,649
admin have usernames and passwords

366
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:07,220
hard-coded inside of them this is why we

367
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:09,949
call this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gallery of fail how could</font>

368
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such a silly mistake but people</font>

369
00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,479
do you know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> means credentials we'll</font>

370
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,749
just go ahead and stick it in right here

371
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,179
now something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see here a theme people</font>

372
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:23,360
tell me is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't look at my</font>

373
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:27,050
program code well yes I can

374
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,579
so I I know I've given part of this this

375
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,750
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> before but i just thought i'd show</font>

376
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,550
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually given this to press</font>

377
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">mic so with if you're doing with the</font>

378
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,449
JavaScript app this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually the code</font>

379
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,699
from Google Finance so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

380
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,620
JavaScript code I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm a</font>

381
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,360
pretty smart guy and I have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

382
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:49,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this does I mean my brain VAR l c equals</font>

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:52,190
false function ID a que CA 0 function<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

384
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,750
mean you can't read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that crap it's all</font>

385
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,310
it's off you skated they've reduced the

386
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,470
variable names how do you read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well</font>

387
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,489
we wrote a fun little program that

388
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:03,140
actually ended up giving the press<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike</font>

389
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,390
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and let me</font>

390
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:07,970
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this way that takes all of</font>

391
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,860
that and here's the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

392
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,060
encrypt this stuff you can't hide it

393
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">because at the end of the day the</font>

394
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,469
browser needs to execute it so you can

395
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:17,570
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hard for a human to read but you</font>

396
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,430
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent the machine from reading</font>

397
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,290
it otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> won't execute well</font>

398
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:23,689
here's the thing i can write a program

399
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,519
that acts like a machine that executes

400
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,620
it understands it and then gives that to

401
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,029
the human user in a way they can

402
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,800
understand so let's analyze this code

403
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:37,010
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a moment cuz it's 300</font>

404
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,990
k of encrypted stuff and sure enough we

405
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:42,079
come right back and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and easy</font>

406
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,430
to see and read it's a lot of you

407
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,459
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could see over here what</font>

408
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,819
functions are actually being accessed so

409
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:52,810
i'll scroll up right here so we see

410
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,910
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like last child last index of</font>

411
00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,500
lavender blush they have a function

412
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:02,810
called lavender blush that's what Wow

413
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">lemon sephra these sounds like really</font>

414
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:11,000
bad sep 40 saffron these sounds like bad

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,770
bridesmaids dresses probably so yeah or

416
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,209
stripper names have you all ever played

417
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:20,329
the stripper name or my little pony

418
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:22,030
named like like ebony jasmine is not a

419
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:25,040
stripper Dave or my little pony Dave

420
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,319
it's kinda hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell so that's if you</font>

421
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,360
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript right what about flash</font>

422
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,809
we talked about decompiling flash well

423
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,909
again you know this let's say somebody

424
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:35,720
wrote a program that's a lot more

425
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,010
professional

426
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,289
looking than that JavaScript program

428
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:46,850
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so this is a lovely</font>

429
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,110
program we use internally inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> HP's</font>

433
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:58,730
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead open this guy up and it goes</font>

434
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,289
ahead works with all versions of action

435
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,940
scripts so action script is what you

436
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,460
write flash in so this basically

437
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,520
decompile the flash object here are all

438
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the namespaces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead and put</font>

actual decompiled source code now that's

00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,600
that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of handy but what happens if</font>

443
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,880
we actually automatically analyzed it

444
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,490
for vulnerabilities for you oh well

445
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,470
that's kind of sexy<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me more</font>

446
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this all right well you're using</font>

447
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,789
the protect tag this flash application

448
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,760
uses the protect AG that protect tag was

449
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,230
a was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early security mechanism to</font>

450
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,450
prevent people from accessing the

451
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,360
contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your flap flash apps however</font>

452
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,049
external tools such as this tool can

453
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,459
simply disregard the security mechanism

454
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,220
you should remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protective from</font>

455
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,770
your app as it serves no purpose you

456
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:50,570
know they've got some tea yeah but

457
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly that's basically a flag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

458
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,220
says please don't touch me so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

459
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,990
see that it highlighted some nice trace

460
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,240
debugging information so it gives me an

461
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:02,020
idea about what's going on inside I'll

462
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:07,700
go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and throw open this is a purely</font>

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:11,809
fake one that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created where did I put</font>

464
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:14,470
it no it was alright well I'll show you

465
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,470

466
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,090
now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely not telling you that</font>

467
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:25,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be released by March</font>

468
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:26,580
23rd or anything but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying if</font>

469
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:30,299
this was released wouldn't that be

470
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,158
pretty cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so here we go I've</font>

471
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:35,039
got just a very basic hello world test

472
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,480
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually were developing this app</font>

473
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,759
and actually hoping to release it at

474
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,350
shmoocon but we had some some technical

475
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:42,179
difficulties<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we couldn't I'm sorry</font>

Heidi that I feel bad cuz that's like to

477
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,480
two things we've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release it</font>

478
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,889
shmoocon and said we would and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

480
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:52,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">projected use this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> swift when she</font>

481
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,929
actually did a demo and here we do an

482
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:57,629
analysis and it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back with a number</font>

no no it's not so it gives me some

495
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,090
information about application<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths we</font>

496
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,409
see debugging pads here documents where

they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing it we see that</font>

500
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,629
recommends that you have as a best

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:43,080
practice your<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash stage being at least</font>

502
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:44,879
215 pixels by 31 38 so that way flash

503
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,239
can properly display security

504
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:49,649
vulnerabilities or security notices you

505
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:52,409
know it go said six you now<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the</font>

506
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:59,959
sexy thing I love let's go ahead back to

507
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:59,960
this guy get file export source code

508
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:07,330
ozie test<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay export complete</font>

509
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:14,430
let's go uh this is why I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

510
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:18,610
 on my desktop all right here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

511
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:20,890
to 0 Z test so we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here's the</font>

512
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,729
app<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had and it's got you know display</font>

514
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,420
it dumped by dot events so we're going

515
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,770
to decompile all the code spit it out

516
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,620
there so you can play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and have</font>

517
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,910
all sorts of fun so expect to see this

518
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,379
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the month it's a lot of</font>

519
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe me I wish we could have</font>

521
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">swift's can we wanted to call it flasher</font>

522
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,080
but the HP folks would not let and you

523
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">see there are still some bugs in it</font>

524
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably an i disposed issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

525
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so anyway because i know i'm</font>

526
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,710

527
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,409
dinner or more like you're standing

528
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,660
between me and more girly drinks

529
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,440
takeaways from this the client is

530
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,700
becoming important again never never

531
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,380
wait no I've got the green stuff that's

532
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:13,390
much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright never in my life did</font>

533
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,450
I think I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that client-side</font>

534
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,500
input validation provides security

535
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,050
because so many people will have

536
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,420
JavaScript that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says oh wait you you</font>

00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,560
know your last<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is O'Reilly first of</font>

571
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,659
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could not use HP's internal</font>

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,340
these errors about you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

stack trace yeah automatic mode so the

578
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,820
client is important again right I mean

579
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,170
it's we're no longer in the web one

580
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,610
point out world where everything was on

581
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the client that browsers a dumb terminal</font>

the web two point O<font color="#CCCCCC"> worlds where we had</font>

583
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,360
richer stuff running on the clients but

584
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,010
still a lot on the server we've kind of

585
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to say web 3.0 because</font>

586
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,400
that'd be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzzword y'all should hit me</font>

587
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,930
in the head with rebar if I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

588
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,230
we've moved to this occasionally

589
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:30,650
connected it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud like the</font>

590
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,210
cloud is a new buzzword so I mean the

591
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,590
client is important regardless of where

592
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,110
your app is running you need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,639
input validation use parameterised

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to like Facebook and</font>

598
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,930
things like that all those applications

599
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,610
are getting served by the same domain so

600
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,160
when you add that<font color="#CCCCCC"> little let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me throw a</font>

606
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,179
cross port and cross paths attacks and

607
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,189
as I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shown you would be</font>

608
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,860
amazed what you can fly find and

609
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,020
client-side code the main thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,179
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that Swift scan for is like</font>

on adult swim like amateur surgeon is my

613
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,139
bitch like all of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured</font>

614
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,580
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to like oh all i have to do is</font>

615
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,710
hold down this hot key and it takes me

616
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next level awesome that's kind of</font>

617
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,820
the fun side then you can actually

618
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,400
because other people are doing like um

619
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,379
peoplesoft oracle SI p what do you think

620
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,060
they're writing their front ends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

621
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,410
not HTML they're starting to write stuff

622
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,360
in

623
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,930
lash and so it's ridiculous what you can

624
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,610
find on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client yeah really really</font>

625
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all I've got I thought I would</font>

626
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:46,659
close with when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were spy and moved to</font>

627
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,190
HP we gave out a bunch of bumper

628
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,600
stickers and asked people to put them up

629
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,400
in interesting places and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

630
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,100
pictures and one of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures i</font>

631
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">got was that so i thought i'd say does</font>

632
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:03,129
anybody have any questions stop looking

633
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the photo and ask me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions uh I'm</font>

634
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:10,120
sorry do you have a legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

635
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know I think it was one of</font>

636
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,429
Caleb's groupies that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it</font>

637
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't a booth babe those are mainly at</font>

638
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,120
RSA not so much black hat but that's

639
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,700
that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much all I've got sure</font>

640
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,199
crypto biology so that's an interesting

641
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,570
thing we've seen where worms go around

642
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,640
and crip stuff and then say I'm you know

643
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,960
pay me and I'll give you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but why</font>

644
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,750
even give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them the key you already got</font>

645
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:42,430
their money oh I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad you</font>

646
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,960
brought this up so so so anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

647
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,820
ever heard of dojo if you do web

648
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,410
development dojos a<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript library</font>

649
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,149
that lets you do crazy so they

650
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually wrap a lot of these offline</font>

651
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,640
applications and let you encrypt stuff

652
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,680
before it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes into the database they're</font>

653
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,110
using AES for their encryption the

654
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,630
problem is is that encryption is only as

655
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,629
strong as the key and so dojo says give

656
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">me a key and if your key is less than</font>

657
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:09,460
like say 32 characters to generate the

658
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,360
key for AES they just know they just pad

659
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:16,480
the rest of it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero bytes so what</font>

660
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're encrypting um it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not their</font>

661
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,840
choices that they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or very poor</font>

662
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,910
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very best what they should be</font>

663
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,120
doing is say if I enter in a password of

664
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,890
ABC you shouldn't do ABC the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros</font>

665
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,110
use it as the key and encrypt it what

666
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,360
they really should do is take ABC append

667
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,159
it to itself Ilan's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

668
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,830
but it's at least it adds more entropy

669
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,720
to the system another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem I see with</font>

670
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:39,310
encryption and databases is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

671
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,620
will do as anybody who's dealt with

672
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,879
encryption knows if you're decrypting

673
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,949
something and you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the wrong key</font>

674
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,020
it will gladly give you garbage data

675
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,620
because it decrypted it incorrectly

676
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,720
because you have to

677
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,790
Ricky so what I see developers do it

678
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,500
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah I'll have a record at</font>

679
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first records in the database</font>

680
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:58,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> call is called this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a test and</font>

681
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,399
then when they decrypt it using my key

682
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,470
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> check to see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the value is this</font>

683
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,730
is a test well the problem is you now

684
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,920
have what's known as a plane a plaintext

685
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,680
attack and I'm sorry a known plaintext

686
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,630
attack so I now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I ever get your</font>

687
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,850
database I have an encrypted value but I

688
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:18,760
know what it's supposed to be which

689
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,590
gives me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of finger hold into how</font>

690
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,690
I should attack it to decrypt it to

691
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,059
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it and so at the end of the</font>

692
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,130
day a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these developers you don't</font>

693
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,690
know security break stuff I'll give you

694
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">another great example there's a site</font>

695
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,429
called page flakes everybody here use

696
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,960
igoogle you know where you can customize

697
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:37,240
your google interface you know and have

698
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,309
calendars there's other sites that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

699
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,140
this that basically let you have other

700
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:43,960
widgets<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook's let you do this um</font>

701
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:45,100
what what page flakes does is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

702
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,600
sometimes you might want to send

703
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,719
encrypted data back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server</font>

704
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,559
instead of using SSL they implemented

705
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,000
RSA in JavaScript so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> went ahead and</font>

706
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">said okay you want to send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to</font>

707
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,450
the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually have a public</font>

708
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,370
and private key they encrypt and send it

709
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,840
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the server this is like going</font>

710
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:07,809
from a stone wheel to a stone Pentagon

711
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,149
it's stupid not as<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and you're gonna</font>

712
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:12,910
hurt somebody the browser already has

713
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,990
optimized routines to do ssl encryption

714
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,179
and public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key encryption</font>

715
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,130
why the hell are you doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

716
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get me wrong i use</font>

717
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,700
javascript in ways it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never intended</font>

718
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,159
but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not stupid enough to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

719
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,320
do cryptography in JavaScript so the

720
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,790
problem is as developers they think they

721
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,350
know what they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to solve these</font>

722
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,639
problems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said and they end up</font>

723
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,169
shooting themselves in the foot by

724
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,780
having known plaintext attacks or

725
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,130
Porky's or implementing public private

726
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,580
key encryption and ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it should</font>

727
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,580
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted</font>

728
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:49,370
I don't know I that's the that's the sad

729
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,570
thing about web security right is at the

730
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,979
end of the day some was like so how do

731
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,409
you protect your grandma and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like I</font>

732
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,000
really know like there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no happy</font>

733
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,210
ending to this I don't I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there's</font>

734
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,440
no by my $50,000 you know one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

735
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,640
and stick in your data center and

736
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,550
everything's cool I wish you could but

737
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,050
it's there's no real happy ending the

738
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,490
thing is is that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be smarter</font>

739
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,260
and here's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that scares</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

740
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,820
about app security and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> rob was</font>

741
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,340
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> about moving it to the</font>

742
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,379
seventh layer is that how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many years did</font>

743
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,080
it take of the IT professional getting

744
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ins the kicked out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it you know</font>

745
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:25,550
to understand firewalls and network

746
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,950
partitioning and vlans and not running

747
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:30,560
freaking telnet on a publicly facing box

748
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,350
right no sure you laugh but I mean it

749
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,050
took 15 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now how many more there</font>

750
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,689
are orders of magnitude more developers

751
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,430
than there are IT professionals so how

752
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,560
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it going to take before you know</font>

753
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,610
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who just discovered PHP is</font>

754
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,620
actually going to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

755
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,590
securely and even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he figures it out</font>

756
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:51,010
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many hundreds more there each day</font>

757
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,010
that's the problem

758
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:03,240
it specifies a sequel server but

759
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:04,830
everyone just used a sequel light I like

760
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,360
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> I configure my browser to use like</font>

761
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:11,189
a local version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of oracle or something</font>

762
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,409
I've done I've done thank you the

763
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:25,890
candles are burning or something thank

764
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:29,540
you Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Billy your scholar and a</font>

765
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,540
gentleman take back the things
