okay how's everybody doing yeah so I'm

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,980
Nicodemus and from the makers local 256

3
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:42,820
we're a hackerspace out from Huntsville

4
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:48,410
Alabama can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hear me all right</font>

5
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:52,820
really can you hear me now can you hear

6
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:56,718
me now does dick dusty commentary all

7
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:59,660
right let me try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I am Nicodemus</font>

8
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:04,489
I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the makers local 256 we're a</font>

9
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:10,490
hacker group in Huntsville Alabama cut

10
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:13,369
it out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

11
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about hackerspaces what</font>

12
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:18,799
our hacker spaces why they're important

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,720
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some in your area and</font>

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:28,130
if need be how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own so what</font>

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,490
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hackerspace hacker spaces are</font>

16
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:34,009
collaborative areas where people can get

17
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">together and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know collaborate</font>

18
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:46,060
obviously hackerspaces kind of look like

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:50,119
this I look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this I look like this</font>

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:53,540
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a bunch of people together</font>

21
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,850
and you can do stuff together you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,670
build off of each other's strengths make

23
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:01,780
up for each other's weaknesses hacker

24
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,780
spaces are creative

25
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:14,470
this is a hackerspace in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany print</font>

26
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,470
t-shirts obviously

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so here's a quote from one of</font>

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,489
our members<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackerspaces are really cool</font>

29
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:35,940
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here are members of a</font>

30
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:43,890
hackerspace really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:48,120
so all the high school people okay all

32
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,679
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually okay for everyone who's</font>

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,860
in the Atlanta area there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:59,250
hackerspace that's being created yes

35
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,650
yeah it is forming so help them out help

36
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,950
them make it and we'll talk about that a

37
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:11,420
second so who goes to hackerspaces who

38
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:11,420
who builds<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker spaces oh geez</font>

39
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:35,529
oh come on all right so who are these

40
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:43,040
crazy hackerspace people there hackers

41
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:51,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">their spacers yeah makers what are</font>

42
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:55,459
makers<font color="#E5E5E5"> they make things geeks and other</font>

43
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,010
people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to be hackers or</font>

44
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:03,680
geeks or freaks or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

45
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:07,159
a normal people oh sorry my bad didn't

46
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,530
mean to offend<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone all right so you</font>

47
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,649
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a hackerspace</font>

48
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,709
a local hackerspace if you can wherever

49
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:21,769
you're from who hears from the Atlanta

50
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:23,419
region all right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you like I</font>

51
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,780
said you got that hacker space forming

52
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:28,669
you're going to want to make it because

53
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,609
if you cannot find one you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

54
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:38,000
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a hackerspace these things</font>

55
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:42,770
are really cool why are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool you</font>

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,169
ask projects everybody knows what

57
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,169
projects are they are the cool things

58
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,520
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but you</font>

59
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,370
never got around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to doing them because</font>

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,508
you either lack the experience the

61
00:04:52,370 --> 00:05:02,229
know-how the motivation the tools the

62
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:05,479
place to do it extra fingers exactly

63
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:09,250
people are doing crazy projects at

64
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,250
hackerspaces all the time

65
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:15,409
and it is motivational to see other

66
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,409
people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects</font>

67
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:32,550
sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strange I honestly</font>

68
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:34,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">have no idea what that is this is a</font>

69
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,980
multi-touch table from our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacker</font>

70
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">space</font>

71
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:54,370
so you have projects really cool a dildo

72
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,609
machine really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

73
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">pool your resources you can pretty much</font>

74
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,830
do anything a hackerspace will allow you

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to focus on your project in theory</font>

76
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:12,490
sometimes you get a little sidetracked

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,550
get a little lazy but it's a lot better

78
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,520
than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your projects worked</font>

79
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,960
out without a hackerspace you don't have

80
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,450
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to motivate you you</font>

81
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,979
don't have the expertise that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

82
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:29,770
your members have group projects so a

83
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:33,520
lot of our projects in Huntsville are

84
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,609
made by multiple members of the group of

85
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,219
the hackerspace and where do you store a

86
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,620
group project you know one person's

87
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,280
house another<font color="#E5E5E5"> person's apartment you</font>

88
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,070
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

89
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,210
make sense so if you have a place a

90
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:53,849
centralized place where you can do these

91
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:56,940
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes it a lot easier people</font>

92
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">hackerspaces are all about the people</font>

93
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,890
you have really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool people at</font>

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,960
hacker spaces and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want a</font>

95
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,880
hacker space because you get to hang out

96
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,080
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and interact with and work with</font>

97
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,380
these really cool interesting

98
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,380
intelligent<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

99
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,750
so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

100
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,180
so yeah like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can leverage the</font>

101
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,948
expertise that everyone has you know say

102
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,870
so and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

103
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:48,759
electronics so one so it's really good

104
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,490
at programming so in so it's really good

105
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,039
at mechanical engineering you bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

106
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,189
this together you can really create<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

107
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,889
things and if you're if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

108
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:01,990
at electronics engineering you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

109
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,569
there's a limit to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do but</font>

110
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're part of a project that has</font>

111
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:12,490
someone who's a climatologist or rocket

112
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,509
scientist you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the types of</font>

113
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:19,409
varieties of projects grow exponentially

114
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:21,759
you can learn so much at a hackerspace

115
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:24,550
you can learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> new skills you can learn</font>

116
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things learn how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

117
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to this a</font>

118
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit later but this is really</font>

119
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:35,260
important doing it yourself as opposed

120
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to letting someone else do it for you</font>

121
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,828
and force you to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font>

122
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:46,209
whatever they give you so you can

123
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:48,969
explore we try out crazy things all the

124
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,619
time we're like ahh you know everybody's

125
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,029
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their friends their</font>

126
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,279
geeky friends or like all wouldn't it be

127
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:56,890
cool if so-and-so and so-and-so well

128
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,930
with a hackerspace you do it you're like

129
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,019
okay well here's some circuit boards

130
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,130
here's some parts yeah here's a solar

131
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,800
panel let's just throw it together

132
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,019
because we can because all that stuff is

133
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,319
there all these people are there and

134
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:13,449
you're in an environment where stuff

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,760
gets done<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

136
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:19,689
projects people are always working on

137
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,569
projects so the the threshold for trying

138
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,149
out new crazy things is really low you

139
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,220
can just do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything you can experiment</font>

140
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:29,500
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really important too and</font>

141
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll get i'll discuss a little bit more</font>

142
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:37,959
on this later so where is a local

143
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:41,329
hackerspace they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> everywhere</font>

144
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:44,479
at Nashville yeah Nashville is a close

151
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,290
this is a map the most recent map of

152
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,850
hacker spaces on hackerspaces org as you

153
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see most of them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in America</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

157
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:26,089
increasing in number and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's some</font>

158
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,209
photos from hackerspaces all over the

159
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,209
world

160
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:40,489
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country you're from</font>

161
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:45,019
so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker spaces just come</font>

162
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:46,249
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a few people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just get</font>

163
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,989
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say wouldn't it be cool if</font>

164
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:52,369
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy things</font>

165
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:56,360
wouldn't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cool to pool our</font>

166
00:10:52,369 --> 00:11:00,619
resources have a place where our tools

167
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,259
can go where parts can go where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

168
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:05,019
just build<font color="#E5E5E5"> things have a workshop mad</font>

169
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:09,110
scientist's laboratory sort of thing

170
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:12,799
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cool and just a few</font>

171
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:16,959
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it let's do it that's</font>

172
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,959
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes well not exactly</font>

173
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:32,379
so yeah there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

174
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:41,290
and like I say they are increasing in

175
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:43,839
number a mobile hackerspace so hopefully

176
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,179
you're you're interested how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start</font>

177
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,589
one well like I said first you need a

178
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:50,470
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people to just say it</font>

179
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,629
let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but then you need a few</font>

180
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,329
other things you need to figure out what

181
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:57,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to do with your hacker space is</font>

182
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,589
your hacker space<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be like a</font>

183
00:11:57,069 --> 00:12:02,290
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> club house where just a few of</font>

184
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:03,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friends can come together and do</font>

185
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,209
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do or do you</font>

186
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:09,549
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make it open a charity</font>

187
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:12,429
like the makers local group we're now a

188
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:16,420
501 c 3 charity registered with the IRS

189
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:18,339
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that because we want our</font>

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,128
personal belief is we want you know

191
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:24,639
openness we want everybody everybody to

192
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,529
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to come in and contribute we</font>

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,670
want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come in learn</font>

194
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:33,089
and be a part of the community and just

195
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,179
grow this mentality of<font color="#CCCCCC"> do-it-yourself</font>

196
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:41,529
you know sort of rugged individualism

197
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:42,999
experiment mad scientist's motif do you

198
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,490
want to start with projects or do you

199
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:47,139
want to start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a space two good</font>

200
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples are the hacker consortium and</font>

201
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:53,379
makers local makers local in Huntsville

202
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:55,628
we started out with projects we didn't

203
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:57,910
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place we just met at someone's</font>

204
00:12:55,629 --> 00:13:00,910
apartment you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> once a week or</font>

205
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,009
whatever and that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored you</font>

206
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,309
know tools and materials<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things so</font>

207
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:09,819
we had projects that kind of gave us

208
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:12,579
motivation and it you know we hit them

209
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:15,429
hit the ground running if you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

210
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:18,069
a space like the hacker consortium you

211
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:20,169
know you are starting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's</font>

212
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:22,179
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you start with a</font>

213
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:25,209
space you have this race but once you

214
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:27,939
have it you know you you're totally free

215
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,079
to run with all your projects and you

216
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:31,839
you know you have a nice solid

217
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:33,699
foundation so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just too different</font>

218
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,599
you know philosophies and you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

219
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:39,039
decide how you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

220
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:46,439
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily the only</font>

221
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:50,049
two ways but two common ways so money

222
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:52,539
money is important obviously these

223
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:55,358
things will cost money<font color="#E5E5E5"> materials will</font>

224
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:56,559
cost money tools will cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> money you</font>

225
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:59,109
know if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to come in and</font>

226
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">give lectures or presentations that'll</font>

227
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:04,059
cost money your place is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going</font>

228
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:19,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cost money it's going to cost of rent</font>

229
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:21,728
utilities etc yeah there's that too so

230
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,539
yeah these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things will cost money you</font>

231
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:28,139
you must be prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for them</font>

232
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:31,019
you're gonna want a good treasurer

233
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:34,019
you're gonna want a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good treasurer</font>

234
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,019
really

235
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:49,479
ya know a lawyer pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear so if</font>

236
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,370
you're going to be a 501c3 you're going

237
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,730
to want to know a lawyer there are laws

238
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:57,150
involved for instance insurance if you

239
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,730
have a place that has a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

240
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,829
high-voltage equipment power tools

241
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,140
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do insurance</font>

242
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,690
somebody at some point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cut</font>

243
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:10,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">off their finger and you know you're</font>

244
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to be prepared for that</font>

245
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,730
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly underage drinkers</font>

246
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:19,540
everything so this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

247
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,940
exactly an easy process you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

248
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,430
learn a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things for the first time</font>

249
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,110
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you're going to have</font>

250
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,870
growing pains things are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

251
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,490
work out exactly as you plan them out to

252
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,420
be so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare for that</font>

253
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,790
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say okay</font>

254
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:39,189
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be perfect but</font>

255
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:43,750
let's do it anyway organization is in

256
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:45,760
theory a good thing kind of hard to do

257
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,080
sometimes but if you can do it it really

258
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:53,760
helps out trying to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one part</font>

259
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:57,030
in this shelf of chaotic in a

260
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization yes</font>

261
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,709
exactly exactly if you can find someone

262
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:11,219
who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a obsessive-compulsive disorder</font>

263
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:13,229
just let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> go OCD people are great</font>

264
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:18,329
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they'll put little bins and</font>

265
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:27,180
labels and everything fantastic exactly

266
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:29,219
exact second troll this is this is

267
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,880
particularly interesting at least for

268
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,930
our group you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of different</font>

269
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways of doing this basically as mean</font>

270
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,130
secure physical security for the for the

271
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,920
space you know do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want little metal</font>

272
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,279
keys that you give out to people that

273
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:49,319
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your members do you have RFID cards</font>

274
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:52,260
do you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah bio verification</font>

275
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,880

276
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,310
think about these things we we use a USB

277
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,870
authentication so our little USB thumb

278
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,969
drives have unique serial numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

279
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:05,760
plug them into the port opens the door

280
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:11,600
we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of cool but you</font>

281
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:14,309
know yeah something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that had a</font>

282
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,399
engadget yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw</font>

283
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:18,209
it at<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaknic that was kind of cool</font>

284
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:24,750
yeah you can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts of different</font>

285
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:27,569
things yeah so if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

286
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,030
growing the hackerspace well what do you

287
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,030
do how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the word out that you</font>

288
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,160
exist first thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would suggest</font>

289
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:37,559
is to go to hackerspaces org and list

290
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,760
your hacker space that's going to reach

291
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,730
a lot of people who are looking for

292
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,570
hackerspaces once you get it off the

293
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,470
ground we were really lucky we got

294
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who was really interested in</font>

295
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,870
promoting our space he actually got an

296
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,429
NPR commercial on the radio that we

297
00:17:51,870 --> 00:18:00,689
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for at all which was</font>

298
00:17:53,429 --> 00:18:02,280
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what is</font>

299
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,480
a hacker space

300
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,770
why they're important while you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

301
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,820
to want one where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can find them and</font>

302
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:14,680
how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build your own so the last</font>

303
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,020
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about is what does</font>

304
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,820
this all mean I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is very</font>

305
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,510
important I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this whole</font>

306
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:25,419
hackerspaces idea is the second version

307
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:28,710
of the Scientific Revolution and what I

308
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:33,670
mean is before the Scientific Revolution

309
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:36,490
what the church said goat what went in

310
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:39,070
that go I can't speak English anymore

311
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm sorry so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that that's that was</font>

312
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,850
the truth you know and that's all you

313
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:46,149
could that's all you were capable of

314
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:50,740
doing God created<font color="#CCCCCC"> man in His image man</font>

315
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:52,900
is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ever know anything</font>

316
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,250
beyond what he already knows you know

317
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,340
that's it we have reached the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pinnacle</font>

318
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,420
of human evolution when these

319
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,780
Enlightenment thinkers came around the

320
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:06,250
Scientific Revolution we said we can

321
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,020
know anything human human

322
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,390
experimentation human knowledge is

323
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,879
infinite whatever we want to know we can

324
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:15,460
know it anything in this universe and so

325
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,600
these guys you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously influenced</font>

326
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,730
the rest of the world the rest of

327
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:26,500
history where a result of that but I

328
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:30,370
think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large majority of the</font>

329
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,270
population it we aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really following</font>

330
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,760
that ideal we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of accepting</font>

331
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,990
what everyone tells us<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what</font>

332
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,510
government tells us what corporations

333
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,160
tell us we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really thinking for</font>

334
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,780
ourselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I think</font>

335
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,270
hackerspaces are really important is

336
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,960
because it shows that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this</font>

337
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,030
ourselves if we want a photo booth we

338
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,580
don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and buy what</font>

339
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,350
we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> build it we can do this we can</font>

340
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,740
do whatever we want we can build

341
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,659
whatever we want we can do it ourselves

342
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">do it yourself mentality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

343
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:07,590
important and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because so many</font>

344
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">hacker spaces are proliferating</font>

345
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,600
proliferating around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> glue</font>

346
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,730
oh that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is a movement and</font>

347
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,039
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really starting to come come to</font>

348
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,759
the realization that yeah the

349
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:22,580
Enlightenment thinkers were right we can

350
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:27,370
know anything we can do anything and

351
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:27,370
this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an enabling movement</font>

352
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:11,279
right

353
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:21,300
right

354
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:44,300
that's right that's right right

355
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:09,110
i think the the what i was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

356
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,670
across was that knowledge<font color="#CCCCCC"> is power</font>

357
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:15,800
basically and hacker spaces are all

358
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,800
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that experiment knowledge</font>

359
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,090
right

360
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,800
well again now

361
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,009
well again what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is you just</font>

362
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,600
need a group of you that are really

363
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:23,019
enthusiastic about it to just say

364
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:23,019
it and do it that's all you need yeah

365
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,720
I will

366
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:48,909
that's right start<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

367
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:08,100
right right right right

368
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:14,699
we have bylaws as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes right</font>

369
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:19,170
okay right okay okay so for the question

370
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:24,800
section of this any makers local 256 who

371
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:29,280
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up if you wouldn't mind</font>

372
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,200
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said different people in</font>

373
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,350
the hackerspace have different expertise

374
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,490
so to feel questions you know we're

375
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,490
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need a lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

376
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:48,840
so what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we actually we</font>

377
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,720
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good friend where we live</font>

378
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,449
and he knows a girl who<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

379
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:59,540
the she used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for one of the</font>

380
00:25:54,450 --> 00:26:03,960
local news stations and wur h lr h

381
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:05,159
anyways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she actually they have a</font>

382
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,160
group that they're getting together to

383
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,590
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help promote local organizations</font>

384
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,400
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so she decided she</font>

385
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:17,189
went to the NPR area our local NPR

386
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,710
station and recorded the PSA for us and

387
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,510
she she's actually writing a couple

388
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,820
articles for us and everything so it's

389
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:27,620
it's really we got another organization

390
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:31,800
to help us with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're trying to do</font>

391
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:33,780
a lot of actually i think all PSA is

392
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,909
they're not allowed to charge for them

393
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,820
and all radio stations are required to

394
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">have so much time dedicated to be SAS a</font>

395
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,110
lot of the more commercial stations only

396
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,970
have them you know play at three<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

397
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:48,120
morning with no one's listening but I

398
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,520
think NPR those<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofit type of</font>

399
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,320
stations are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best sources to hit so</font>

400
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,810
hit up your local NPR station and just

401
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,240
ask if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can record a free PSA and if</font>

402
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,129
they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you some attention</font>

403
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:05,270
traffic because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that yeah we got a</font>

404
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:05,270
lot of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> at our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open houses yep</font>

405
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,870
yeah

406
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:22,149
um Tom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh yeah we're a lot of</font>

407
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:23,979
computer-based a lot of computers where

408
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,768
the place that we rented we got tables

409
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:29,320
so that that was good for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> but our</font>

410
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,529
table saw just like little hand tools

411
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,000
our space is only about 800 square feet

412
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:36,399
it's a little house it has a little

413
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,110
backyard but at this point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have about</font>

414
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,529
20 members we're running out of space so

415
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">any kind of big tools that we would want</font>

416
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:44,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to buy like I bought a table saw the</font>

417
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,179
other day for us because we're working

418
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:47,649
we were working on a big project but

419
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:49,870
that's probably the biggest thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

420
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,340
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a table saw and we</font>

421
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:58,299
have to take it out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shed because</font>

422
00:27:51,340 --> 00:28:05,709
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just we don't have room for it a CNC</font>

423
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:06,908
machine make your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> yard I don't</font>

424
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:10,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys have anything like</font>

425
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:12,909
that i mean drill press absolutely band

426
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:18,939
saws<font color="#E5E5E5"> three strand air 33 degree</font>

427
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:20,289

freaknic outer zone last year we

437
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,760
originally made a photo booth it was

438
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much portable that we wrapped up</font>

439
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,299
we've completely redone that it all

440
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,450
wraps up into one box now a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

441
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:07,790
it's a lot sturdier lighter than it used

442
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,760
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that will be up in our room later</font>

443
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:16,309

444
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:19,549
that we brought with us the the USB door

445
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:21,799
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our members the</font>

446
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,360
multi-touch yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also in touch table</font>

447
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,400
he's working on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of crazy</font>

448
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,010
luggable computer that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug</font>

449
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,540
your guitar guitar right into and it's

450
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:34,280
got speakers on the back and everything

451
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:37,070
so a lot of lot of websites and and

452
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,899
IRC<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS and things like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

453
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,639
it's about as varied as the group

454
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,270
because the group comes up with the

455
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,380
ideas we all have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a sheet of</font>

456
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,379
ideas we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to work</font>

457
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the photo booth was worked</font>

458
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,720
on by probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten different people by</font>

459
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,810
the time he got done and Bob being like

460
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,310
the most help on it probably design and

461
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,659
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through just like different</font>

462
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,419
people jumping in and doing their own

463
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,030
like oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this so you know I have</font>

464
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,900
this tool and I'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

465
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,280
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best things</font>

466
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the hackerspace is the</font>

467
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,560
collaborative effort my skills mainly

468
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,659
lay in hardware and some software but

469
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,460
mechanical things are very much beyond

470
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,000
me I just don't really grasp it very

471
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,820
well well we took the time to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a USB</font>

472
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,440
door I could do the soldering and I

473
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,320
could do the programming but attaching

474
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,290
it to a deadbolt I couldn't wrap<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind</font>

475
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,480
around that Greg a bike was able to make

476
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,070
an interface for the door where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

477
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,140
something that it when I hit that I

478
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,570
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on oh well here's</font>

479
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the here's where my expertise ends in</font>

480
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,000
that project would have gone in a box

481
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:57,560
and sat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner for another two</font>

482
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,880
years exactly make your own hackerspace

483
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,350
bring those down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somebody will</font>

484
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,350
probably work on them for you

485
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,490
you

486
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,560
yeah the probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guerilla drive-in</font>

487
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:56,970
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we grab the FM transmitter off ebay</font>

490
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,940
town until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found a good wall project</font>

493
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,189
had probably 30 or 40 people show up in

507
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:23,379
when what the insurance was when we came

508
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">in they didn't know how to classify as</font>

509
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">they asked us things like okay what does</font>

512
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,389
learning experience what kind of

513
00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:37,840
equipment do you have dangerous

514
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:39,668
equipment and what kind of training do

515
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,529
you have professional training do you

516
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:44,230
have and are you offering to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the</font>

517
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:45,879
string those equipment none you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

518
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,230
it's it's things like that that the

519
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:49,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">insurance companies didn't know how to</font>

520
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal with us and hacker consortium and</font>

521
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:53,799
our group uses the same insurance

522
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,139
provider however we were into an

523
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:58,240
interesting part where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

524
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:00,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same deal that they could they have</font>

525
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,779
a much better policy than we do and

526
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,539
you'll find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's because of</font>

527
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:06,039
different states as you cross<font color="#E5E5E5"> the border</font>

528
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,610
will give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> different insurance</font>

529
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,610
policies

530
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:53,348
yeah engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> funhouse</font>

531
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,560
what

532
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,130
the fees actually when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we when we first</font>

533
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:38,970
incorporated we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with the</font>

534
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:40,200
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having a flat donation fee we</font>

535
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,808
played with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ideas that was one</font>

536
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the ideas that we had we made an</font>

537
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:50,519
incorrect assumption believing that the

538
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:52,769
501c3 IRS would not grant us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 501c3</font>

539
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,419
if we have membership that we had to

540
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:57,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">have variable donations it turns out you</font>

541
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,269
can do both we did end up doing a what

542
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,039
we do is a membership system or a

543
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,439
donation system is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should say a</font>

544
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,059
pledge system you come in you fill an

545
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,710
application and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose the amount</font>

546
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:10,849
that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in every month and</font>

547
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:13,500
whatever amount that you choose we are

548
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:16,140
softly you know expecting that

549
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,400
contribution every month and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll come</font>

550
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,759
to you and say hey you said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

551
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put in 20 month it's we would like</font>

552
00:41:20,759 --> 00:41:25,140
you to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your donation now because we</font>

553
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:26,670
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the lights</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on one of the</font>

554
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems that we face when we were</font>

555
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:32,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for a space was they asked us</font>

556
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:34,049
what we were going to do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

557
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,569
would tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a think tank and</font>

558
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:37,740
they'd immediately say well we want to

559
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything to do with you I didn't</font>

560
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,788
realize the think tank had a political

561
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">connotation they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking hey we're</font>

562
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:44,910
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're going</font>

563
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be doing lobbying out of this thing</font>

564
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,269
and it wasn't until<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finally asked him</font>

565
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:49,859
was like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you say you don't</font>

566
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:50,910
want to can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just ask why and they're</font>

567
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,799
like we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to do with</font>

568
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,210
politics we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have anything to do</font>

569
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:55,680
with politics so when you're going

570
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:59,250
around don't don't describe yourself as

571
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,480
a thing take technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> think tank maybe</font>

572
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,579
I don't know like they hear the word

573
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,970
think tank and they put a red flag on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

574
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:08,359
they won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have anything to do in there</font>

575
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:12,779
there are some other places i know the

576
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:14,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">HD has a very set membership do that you</font>

577
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:16,019
do pay or you know and they say to every

578
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:18,809
but this is what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay</font>

579
00:42:16,019 --> 00:42:20,589
each month where we have the open pledge

580
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:24,010
system

581
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:26,920
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how everybody all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

582
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:29,800
other hackers basis do it though but

583
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've at least seen those two methods the</font>

584
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,280
way we started out like as far as

585
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,590
getting a building was we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

586
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,570
said hey we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

587
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,310
getting a space for however long how

588
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,520
much can everyone contribute one month

589
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:44,140
for a year and so to me at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just</font>

590
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,730
started out as a one-year experiment to

591
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,859
see where when everyone said I'll

592
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,510
contribute this much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year and we</font>

593
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,310
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we know what kind of place</font>

594
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,740
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for what kind of rates we</font>

595
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,360
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at to get don't</font>

596
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,750
forget to account for like utilities and

597
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,400
internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so that's that's how</font>

598
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,990
we started out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contribution</font>

599
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,340
system and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we developed</font>

600
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:06,390
the membership applications and the

601
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,390
pledge system and all that

602
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:45,339
yeah and we're actually sorry um we're

603
00:44:41,799 --> 00:44:48,849
our lease the year experiment as you say

604
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:51,880
is almost up for us and we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

605
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:54,999
expanding we we pretty much doubled in a

606
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,430
year we have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 act 20 full</font>

607
00:44:54,999 --> 00:45:00,069
members that are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shop all the</font>

608
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,180
time doing something usually so we're in

609
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process of looking for a new place</font>

610
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,819
and we've been looking around at local

611
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:10,479
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> art centers there's a place and</font>

612
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:12,459
we just other we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

613
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:14,288
groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple other nonprofits that</font>

614
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,549
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at leasing a giant</font>

615
00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:19,719
building and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of splitting it up</font>

616
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:21,099
among us and so I like I said we doubled

617
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,349
in a year and so now we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

618
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:25,299
process of looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a place something</font>

619
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:28,380
maybe like what they have or you know

620
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:28,380
something like that

621
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,799
yes somebody brought up engineering

622
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">funhouse to me the other day and I</font>

623
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,660
thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a pretty good way to</font>

624
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,810
explain what we do or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hobby shop I</font>

625
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:07,480
liked that term because we were a shop

626
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,670
like a like a machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> shop but it's for</font>

627
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,099
hobbyists and there are places like that

628
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,080
popping up where your rent it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

629
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:24,270
an organization but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a space</font>

630
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:24,270
that you're renting yes yeah texture

631
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:06,150
well that's that's the whole point of

632
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:08,289
having a hackerspace is to get

633
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:13,680
like-minded people together that note

634
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:13,680
different things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do one thing yes</font>

635
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:52,368
I'll tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> from experience being in</font>

636
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:55,700
charge of a project I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to do</font>

637
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:58,249
one thing differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think when we if</font>

638
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to go the 501c3 route it's</font>

639
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:02,839
only retroactive either one year or the

640
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:05,808
date that you incorporated whichever one

641
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:07,869
is shorter so before if you decide from

642
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:10,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> get-go that you want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 501c3</font>

643
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:13,249
incorporate before you start to go look

644
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,368
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place to rent because if you are</font>

645
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:18,019
putting money into a rental place before

646
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:21,140
you incorporate all of those paychecks

647
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:24,819
are not tax-deductible until that day

648
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,819
that you incorporated

649
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,559
I

650
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:24,420
it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there yeah</font>

651
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've looked at it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it's in</font>

652
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:46,510
what we filed together our 501 C 3 we

653
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:51,990
haven't actually gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and taught</font>

654
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:51,990
any classes or with

655
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,240
Oh No

656
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:11,450
if i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistaken NYC resistors they</font>

657
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:13,670
do classes a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of classes a month</font>

658
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't that correct they charged you know</font>

659
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:18,920
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what they charge money for</font>

660
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:20,869
it and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what they get at</font>

661
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:25,670
least some of their bills paid over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

662
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:29,119
over the one and we plan we plan on

663
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:31,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that that's it are our dream we</font>

664
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,250
haven't accomplished that yet because of

665
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:36,019
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space and you know just</font>

666
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:39,730
other things but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we</font>

667
00:55:36,019 --> 00:55:43,038
plan on doing yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a</font>

668
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:45,470
what's got a solder he has a license for

669
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:48,019
soldering whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and he said</font>

670
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:49,759
he's plans he'll he'll be happy to come

671
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:53,140
in and teach classes about learning how

672
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to solder and things like that so</font>

673
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:04,779
are you talking about tax benefits

674
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,419
educational discounts those types of

675
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:10,059
things yeah educational discount you

676
00:56:07,419 --> 00:56:13,660
need being accredited institution not

677
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:15,009
apply tax benefits depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the state</font>

678
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:18,098
in Tennessee as soon as you get your

679
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:21,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">private 1c3 everything that you buy for</font>

680
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:24,459
your own juice or giveaway is all tax

681
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:27,579
free courtesy state of Tennessee Alabama

682
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:32,558
not so Alabama you have to get written

683
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:34,059
into the state laws to benefit so every

684
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">seriously one of the organizations in</font>

685
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:41,169
Alabama that has tax-free status has a

686
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:44,078
line in the law so it was like the 20 or

687
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:46,288
30 actual organizations stuck in the

688
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,289
wall

689
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:58,059
yes reshape it it's almost definitely

690
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,980

695
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:29,190
room but check this out probably 430

696
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:32,190
yeah there you have a meeting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday</font>

hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation which is a 501c3</font>

704
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,580
dedicated to helping hackerspaces get

705
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:05,430
started that's all I deal about it some

706
