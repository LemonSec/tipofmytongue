1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,670
a shirt he also does a class which he's

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,590
probably going to talk about during his

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,030
talk about data recovery which both some

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,389
ninja master and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have taken the class</font>

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,150
I can tell you that for five days of

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,330
sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy's training class</font>

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,590
blood was coming out of my nose and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ears</font>

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:25,198
because he crammed us so full of

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,500
information good information in<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,119
five days stuff that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,440
go back to the real world and use and

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,530
have many times since then so what was

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,870
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for freaknik</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last year that I asked</font>

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,110
to do to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> Freaknik for freaknik I</font>

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,660
asked him he's done some real high-end

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:48,390
multimedia presentations at Def Con and

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,429
smooth and black hat and I said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,780
what those are really cool takes a while

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,460
to get them down why don't you do the

20
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">top 10 things you didn't know about your</font>

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,059
hard drive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one actually was</font>

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,770
fairly popular and it made the circuit

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,169
for all the big talks and everything yep

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,339
and he came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said oh I got</font>

25
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,110
one raid by sight and sound come on it

26
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,820
just keeps getting better every time I'm

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,830
waiting to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do Def Con</font>

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,610
this year

29
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got Scott is very very knowledgeable</font>

30
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,850
on hard drives and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever had one</font>

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to crack it</font>

32
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,110
apart check with him and get some good

33
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,190
information from him if you get a chance

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">take his class if not at least get on</font>

35
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,570
youtube and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for his videos or hang</font>

36
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,679
some really really good information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

37
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,500
I'm we get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the light so you can</font>

38
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,729
get started<font color="#CCCCCC"> y'all have fun and there's</font>

39
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">no doubt that I'm going to run over</font>

40
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:51,130
especially now there's no way I could

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:02:00,039
cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes out of this you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

42
00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:02,110
seen this one seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright this one</font>

43
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:09,610
is raid reconstruction by sight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

44
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:11,560
sound yeah you ever seen this one I have

45
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,160
not subjected you to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> betta talk for</font>

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,720
this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right okay so here's sorry</font>

47
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do hard drives I do with tonal hard</font>

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
drives I'm primarily dealing with

49
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,900
physical recoveries so I deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,720
stuff that's like you know a hard drive

51
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,730
got shot with a gun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a bullet</font>

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,959
hole through the PCB board or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,090
like that as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as then hit the</font>

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,220
platters I'm in pretty good shape so i

55
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,540
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do physical repair and go</font>

56
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,859
through a number of things done some

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,798
things for<font color="#E5E5E5"> f beyond a couple other</font>

58
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:40,510
things so so that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story in</font>

59
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:42,190
the background and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

60
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,630
precludes everything that's about to

61
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,130
happen here because now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

62
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,570
becomes you know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen my other</font>

63
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,519
talks you've actually gone through<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

64
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,989
of the stuff about physical repair and

65
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,579
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting kind of old now everybody</font>

66
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">knows that i do physical repair and it's</font>

67
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there now what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do once</font>

68
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,380
you've actually repaired something or

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,720
you have some damage let's assume for

70
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,640
instance in a raid array that you had

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,560
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad sectors and these bad</font>

72
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,238
sectors you were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually clone</font>

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,109
the drive using some special tools and

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got a whole bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other tricks</font>

75
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:09,250
for for cloning things that have really

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,900
bad sectors even getting things ignoring

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,430
ECC and a bunch of other errors which

78
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,829
you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look some videos and</font>

79
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,269
figure out but the issue becomes all

80
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,370
right you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some damage and it's</font>

81
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:20,440
too damaged to put back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original</font>

82
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,970
raid array that you can't just take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

83
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put the stuff back on the</font>

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,270
controller and get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

85
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,290
so what do you do you know or what if

86
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,450
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the original controller</font>

87
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,579
or even worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what if you</font>

88
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,280
don't know how it was configured let's

89
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,690
say you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my shop I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get three</font>

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,190
drives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mail and they just say</font>

91
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">raid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five on them and I've got to figure</font>

92
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">out most everything in some cases i'm</font>

93
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,209
lucky enough that they might have

94
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,070
written the order of the drives that

95
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,510
they took them out in usually I'll know

96
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,549
something usually they'll tell me one

97
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,220
thing or another and this is typically

98
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,590
irregardless of file systems this is in

99
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,540
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did physical recovery and I</font>

100
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,400
did a file system so basically what i'm

101
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,720
going to do really quick is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

102
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,340
just kind of hit and some of you may

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">know some of the basics and whatever but</font>

104
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to be specific about why I'm</font>

105
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,799
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for recovery and then</font>

106
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,230
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a demo at the end i'm</font>

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,760
actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i have i have DD</font>

108
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:14,590
images of a raid array on my drive 33

109
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,120
physical raid drives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

110
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,700
reassemble them here live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in real time</font>

111
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,190
in a few minutes so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

112
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,510
the way that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go so demos are</font>

113
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:27,160
not what I normally do in my

114
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:30,219
presentation so I have one I have won<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

115
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,940
won this one's really you know this

116
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,250
one's really yeah oh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely a</font>

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,050
little bit you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so</font>

118
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,630
anyway so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a reef</font>

119
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,979
coverage arrayed what is not raid and

120
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,479
what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to screw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with then</font>

121
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,130
raid 0 rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 and then I'm going to do a</font>

122
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,349
demo so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit you with a lot</font>

123
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff and sight and sound that's kind</font>

124
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,340
of the point the other thing is is that

125
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,290
besides assuming that you have actually

126
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to physically image this drive</font>

127
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,510
because that's typically what you're

128
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,039
going to do when you have a raid array

129
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,539
you're going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad drive and</font>

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to image it in some fashion</font>

131
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,570
you're going to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get</font>

132
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that image repaired get the drive</font>

133
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,710
running and go on and on but now that

134
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,880
you've actually got this what you're

135
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,590
going to do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reconstruction and</font>

136
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the other idea that i have here is</font>

137
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,130
I want to do this on the cheap I don't

138
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,140
want to go spend in you know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

139
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,729
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do anybody done raid</font>

140
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,250
reconstructions before anybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

141
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:20,140
room ever tried yeah it's a bitch and

142
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,940
it's like the hardest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you can do</font>

143
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,169
takes weeks to do it and get it right

144
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,520
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

145
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,049
do to get it you know fundamental

146
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,330
anybody ever tried to use in case to do

147
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,770
a raid reconstruction and freaking bombs

148
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,300
or something crashed it and you spend

149
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,280
thirty seven hundred dollars on it well

150
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,900
anyway so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this 100</font>

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,460
bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> or less that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much my</font>

152
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,429
point how do you do this

153
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,650
the hacker way so so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me talk about</font>

154
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,449
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from a raid standpoint</font>

155
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,489
it's supposed to be a redundant array of

156
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:47,410
inexpensive or independent drives it

157
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,210
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> started out as inexpensive and</font>

158
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,759
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them terms that gets kind</font>

159
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,810
of munge<font color="#E5E5E5"> dup a little bit you know then</font>

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,520
you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your boss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you go I</font>

161
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,990
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> this raid array and he says what is</font>

162
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,549
a raid you go redundant array of

163
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,400
inexpensive and they look at the go

164
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,930
inexpensive what the hell so so people

165
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,210
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switch to independent disks and</font>

166
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:06,400
stuff like that now and then the term

167
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,960
house you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before 10 years ago you</font>

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,758
didn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> find people having raids at</font>

169
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,080
home and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's become</font>

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,340
a marketing term kind of thing where

171
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll go to store you go buy a lacie</font>

172
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,000
drive and it's just a it says raid on

173
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,759
the box and they bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because they</font>

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,440
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was redundant so so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

175
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,520
and so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the issue here</font>

176
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,680
and that's where you're dealing with

177
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of these things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay bods so</font>

178
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,139
Jay by just means a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disks it is</font>

179
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,270
not a it is not a raid it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just two</font>

180
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,159
drives in order concatenated in some

181
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,719
fashion maybe custom written software or

182
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,370
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the time you see them</font>

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look like this box if you've</font>

184
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,789
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> these you know Lacey boxes you take</font>

185
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,799
them open you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two drives or</font>

186
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:43,449
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this now in it they</font>

187
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,310
change their boxes quite often so in

188
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,349
some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> J bod they</font>

189
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,120
may actually be a raid array or you may

190
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,130
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with something like this which is</font>

191
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,530
their nasty<font color="#CCCCCC"> ox's anybody got this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lacey</font>

192
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nash box has a ethernet cable coming out</font>

193
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,239
of it you guys have this<font color="#CCCCCC"> No</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so</font>

194
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:00,159
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do is they create</font>

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,469
like two partitions at the beginning of

196
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,180
the disks that have a linux boot on them

197
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,039
and then they have the rest of the

198
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,710
partition set aside and that's rated

199
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,699
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other disk so</font>

200
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:11,380
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

201
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,849
complications you've got an offset on

202
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,099
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first drive that you've got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

203
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:17,440
past and then look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sets of</font>

204
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,849
data and restripe those things back

205
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,259
together again before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any data</font>

206
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,370
because if you just say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive and</font>

207
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,830
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive and put them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back together</font>

208
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,650
you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your data and you have</font>

209
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,330
again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in relation to the</font>

210
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,888
actual file system but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to use</font>

211
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,419
file systems in some cases to figure

212
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,250
this out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then to extract the files</font>

213
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:35,560
but typically like if you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

214
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,090
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG on a disk it doesn't matter what</font>

215
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,009
the file system was typically it's still

216
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,948
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG and it still got the same stuff</font>

217
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,409
unless it's something like XFS XFS mae

218
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,210
mae rhaid stuff or may put it in out of

219
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,740
order so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some other</font>

220
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,779
things to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you've got</font>

221
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,080
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks which you know in the</font>

222
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:52,090
window

223
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,008
world it's just basically they're just

224
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken in a pending the configuration at</font>

225
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:58,930
the end of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk and you can have</font>

226
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,460
multiple drives in volumes and but these

227
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,659
are fairly easy to actually put back

228
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,388
together if you can get the drugs

229
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:06,639
running again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using a piece of</font>

230
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,580
software that 79 bucks is called our

231
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,289
studios and independent I'm not like you

232
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,409
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling our studios but it's a</font>

233
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:18,250
cheap easy way to figure stuff out and

234
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:20,080
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Studios if you put a disc on it</font>

235
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,639
it'll actually tell you oh look I see

236
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,080
you know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's just one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

237
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,310
and the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> not good it'll still</font>

238
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,960
tell you from the configuration that

239
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,400
you've got content there and you can put

240
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,568
those back together if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

241
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,099
more about that one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually did like</font>

242
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:31,690
a 10 minute movie actually reassemble

243
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:33,338
them in about 10 minutes so you can

244
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure that one out and go on youtube</font>

245
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:37,630
and find that so so just to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hit</font>

246
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,899
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics of what we're going to</font>

247
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,750
talk about raid 0 is basically strike so

248
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,370
your problem is normally in a raid 0 in

249
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases you're looking at two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disks</font>

250
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,360
so you go to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> these lazy drives you</font>

251
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,800
got two disks you can have way more than

252
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
two disks and that's where the problem

253
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
starts coming in tremendously from a

254
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying to figure out what</font>

255
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,140
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of the disks are if you end up</font>

256
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,029
with something like a raid 0 6 disk

257
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,980
array well you've got a lot of

258
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,329
combinations of stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

259
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,220
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with try to figure out what the</font>

260
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:08,199
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these drives were most of the</font>

261
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,269
time there's no sequencing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drives</font>

262
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:11,740
they use all the space on the drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

263
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:13,420
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't write a signature at the</font>

264
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,029
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the disk that says hi I'm</font>

265
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">disc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 hi I'm just too so people pull</font>

266
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,699
them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they just you know ship</font>

267
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,410
them off someplace and they don't mark

268
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,760
them and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you've got a problem of</font>

269
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,670
figuring out which one's the first disc

270
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,649
or even in many cases custom stripe

271
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,089
sizes so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time what you're</font>

272
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,040
looking at is you'll have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc and it</font>

273
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,920
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a stripe sighs and by default</font>

274
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,240
it's normally like 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> K so your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

275
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,680
is now well how do I figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

276
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,570
order and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do I figure out what my</font>

277
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,099
stripe size is if I don't know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

278
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,140
I've got to reassemble this you know

279
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,120
munge it up damaged disc so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

280
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,760
get into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> raid 1 hopefully you'll</font>

281
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,920
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> see raid it got cut off and number</font>

282
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,329
85 once you get up into most the other

283
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">so your most common that you're going to</font>

284
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,680
see is a raid 1 and array 5 the idea is

285
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,390
supposed to be and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a raid 0 and a</font>

286
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,399
raid 5 and you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see</font>

287
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:58,839
normally a<font color="#E5E5E5"> raid 1 because the idea was</font>

288
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,329
it was mirrored and that you actually

289
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,350
had a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the disk and raid 6 you've</font>

290
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,670
got another parody draw

291
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,220
or another<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive would distribute a</font>

292
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,719
parody on it so raid 5 and raid 0 the

293
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,650
two most common you're going to see most

294
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,320
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time so raid 0 because it's a</font>

295
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,000
stripe it is not redundant if you don't

296
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,460
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the drives you got nothing</font>

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,530
how do you have to get some part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

298
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,290
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> job so I call them aids because</font>

299
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,810
they shouldn't be called rain it's an

300
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,939
array of independent drives that suck so

301
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,199
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that and it's worse if you've</font>

302
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,360
got more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because so you can just</font>

303
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine okay instead of having two</font>

304
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,280
drives I've got six drives how bad you

305
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get age that's pretty bad so so</font>

306
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you start seeing that</font>

307
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,490
that guy normally they're using it for

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,960
video processing but these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I mean</font>

309
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,430
people doing it like in max with

310
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,600
software aid and stuff like that's a

311
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,829
common thing they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep plugging</font>

312
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,480
drives in and say give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big giant</font>

313
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,700
amount of space so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have 3 terabyte</font>

314
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,260
or something wrong that's a bad way to

315
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,330
go no backups how you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to back that</font>

316
00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:00,760
up anyway but anyway so that ends up

317
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">being the problem oh very very prone to</font>

318
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,270
errors anyone drive fails and it's over

319
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">so here's the pretty picture already</font>

320
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:08,439
showed talked about and then that you

321
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,540
can have just as an example if you end

322
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,430
up having<font color="#E5E5E5"> two drives or more I mean if</font>

323
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,199
you just look at this once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

324
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,630
get to like four drives you can have up

325
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,070
to 72 different combinations of the

326
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,720
order of the drawers and if you can't

327
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,000
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard for</font>

328
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,250
software to figure it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you there</font>

329
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,930
are some pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of software there's a</font>

330
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,730
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> called runtime who will actually</font>

331
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the software and run an entropy</font>

332
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:32,020
test against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and try to figure</font>

333
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,870
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the slice sizes are and then</font>

334
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,610
tell it back to you it works sometimes

335
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,380
and when it's right it's right when it's

336
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,440
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root that's always wrong so</font>

337
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,370
that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gray area there</font>

338
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,780
but most of time you've got to figure

339
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">this out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on your own which means you're</font>

340
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,439
going to manually be swapping data

341
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,970
dynamically to try to figure out what

342
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,500
these things are so I've come up with a

343
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,420
way to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this kind of by sight</font>

344
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and sound most of the time you can</font>

345
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,189
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what your first drive is the</font>

346
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,500
reason is is if it has an MBR on it of

347
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,970
any kind has partition table most of the

348
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,290
time it's at the beginning it's it's

349
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,260
going to be in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first chunk of data</font>

350
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:06,520
so if you've got say ntfs and you've got

351
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,350
your partition table you're going to be

352
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,530
at sector 63 and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like</font>

353
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so if you get this that's the first</font>

354
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:15,370
drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally I mean you can change it</font>

355
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,760
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but by default that's the</font>

356
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,260
way most

357
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,490
tomorrow because they form at both

358
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,860
drives and they use the whole chunk

359
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,710
together to actually make their volumes

360
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,270
you know stripe together whatever so you

361
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,100
can usually tell which one's the first

362
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,660
one so you get the first one almost for

363
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,760
free the rest of them you got to figure

364
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">out so if you only have two drives in</font>

365
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,030
raid 0 you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably figure that out</font>

366
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:39,550
pretty quickly so so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

367
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to back it up so ultimately</font>

368
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,800
the point is is that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

369
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,940
have to guess at some sort of slice size

370
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,430
so once you figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I got the</font>

371
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,720
first drive I have three other jobs what

372
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,670
order do I put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and you try to</font>

373
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,020
dynamically create this you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

374
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to swap through those three choices</font>

375
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,410
and then you're going to try to do

376
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,180
something now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my world it's really</font>

377
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,270
easy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to figure this out by trying</font>

378
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG gifs some sort of graphic</font>

379
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,860
or even mp3's almost everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has a</font>

380
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,469
raid array even if it was just a basic

381
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,330
install of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows or something on this</font>

382
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">raid array it's got sample pictures in</font>

383
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,920
it so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> what ends up happening</font>

384
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,200
is you take it you guess your stripe and

385
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,880
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't try to reassemble</font>

386
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,850
the rest of their aid all you do is you

387
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,140
say scan for JPEGs and you can tell the

388
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">identifier that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scan for</font>

389
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll demo it and show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

390
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,469
shortly and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you extract the JPEGs</font>

391
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,000
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at them in size so</font>

392
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,980
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

393
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,260
stripe size is so I've got two drives

394
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,660
and let's say one was set for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 K</font>

395
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,069
stripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> size and then their weed together</font>

396
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,439
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen is I'm going to</font>

397
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have half of a pitcher over here and the</font>

398
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,110
other piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a pitcher is going to be</font>

399
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,940
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and they're going to go back</font>

400
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and forth between the drives so it's not</font>

401
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,320
going to look contiguous if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

402
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture we got fragmentation</font>

403
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
a few other things but most of the time

404
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,730
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be contiguous space so</font>

405
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,500
what you do is you extract these jpgs

406
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,090
and then you look at what the

407
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,100
possibilities for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controllers were</font>

408
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,680
and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> default almost all of them use</font>

409
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,080
the same basic set up against it's the

410
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,069
default normally 64 some some you know

411
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,840
some guys going to be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

412
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,640
going I'm making a raid array let's not

413
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,010
choose 64 let's play with this setting

414
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,900
you know some guys do that I don't know

415
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,880
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there for you know</font>

416
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,439
database optimization but<font color="#E5E5E5"> those aren't</font>

417
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,990
the guys sending me the drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

418
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,220
they would know that by that time so so

419
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,870
what you do is you extract all these

420
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,730
jpgs right and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole slew</font>

421
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,620
of different sizes you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have small</font>

422
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,270
thumbnails you'll have medium<font color="#CCCCCC"> sized</font>

423
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,500
pictures you'll get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know somebody</font>

424
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,090
took it with a 5 mega pick

425
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,520
Cameron you're getting you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

426
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">three four mags so you can actually take</font>

427
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,900
a look at these files and see what size

428
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,530
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in because if you have</font>

429
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,360
let's say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 k stripe any thumb thumb</font>

430
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,490
thumb nails that are smaller than 32 k

431
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,170
are going to look fine anything over 32

432
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,150
k and you have to look at repetitively

433
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,110
at more than one just to make sure that

434
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not looking at one that had a</font>

435
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,280
boundary at the time did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it split but</font>

436
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,540
typically you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it pretty quickly</font>

437
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,449
the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pictures are going</font>

438
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,689
to be 32k you're going to be okay then

439
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,850
64k if it's still under 64 case a 58 k

440
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,890
it will still look<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

441
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,300
still look fine and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on all</font>

442
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way through the segment so you just</font>

443
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,170
keep thinking sizes after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so this</font>

444
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what we're talking about you know how</font>

445
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,780
do you know when you're wrong with your

446
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,979
slice size and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

447
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:20,110
right slice size so all right so you

448
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,910
extract one of these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures and</font>

449
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,220
this is the kind of stuff you'll see

450
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,810
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it's completely missing this</font>

451
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,250
whole middle portion and we want that

452
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,130
middle portion i can tell you we<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font>

453
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,010
wait you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> although a girl with the</font>

454
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:34,780
head right now anyway ultimately the

455
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,760
whole point is is that you know this was

456
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a fairly large file we're missing a</font>

457
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:41,140
chunk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle this is something</font>

458
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you guys can normally recognize so</font>

459
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,160
this was 140 k file these are the

460
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,740
default samples that are like on a

461
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,510
windows disk or something so so around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

462
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,460
hundred forty k if you actually look at

463
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,710
this you can almost figure out hey look

464
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,790
I got a 64 k you know it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

465
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,530
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the picture before you</font>

466
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,599
actually keep on going and then it

467
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,069
continues on correctly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know right</font>

468
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,900
off the bat I'm looking at a dry I'm

469
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,320
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at there's only two drives in</font>

470
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,510
this stripe so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a raid 0 and the</font>

471
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,339
stripes are actually 64k insides<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

472
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,900
physically see that just by glancing at

473
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,630
it as opposed to trying to use some

474
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,060
fancy way of doing something and then if

475
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,730
I get smaller than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are 32 k</font>

476
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,170
files so these are small 32k files

477
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,839
they're completely intact nothing wrong

478
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,969
with them this is a thumbnail and this

479
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,980
is like 58 k something around that range

480
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,020
and this is a thumbnail you know Jay

481
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,130
page can have a JPEG embedded in them so

482
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,800
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a thumbnail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's embedded</font>

483
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,780
in a larger jpg so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extracted this</font>

484
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,640
I got into thumbnail and the thumbnail

485
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,520
was small and looked fine the real

486
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,370
picture however which was over that it

487
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,790
was completely screwed up so I could not

488
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,320
get

489
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,819
picture back in this fashion but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

490
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,250
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at so</font>

491
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,650
over 58 k or so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I'm at least at</font>

492
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,780
64 k I can go up the chain until I get

493
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,240
228 k some of these raid arrays

494
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,010
especially the boxes you buy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

495
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,410
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shelf or something a buffalo or</font>

496
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,120
something might have a 512k slice you

497
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,010
may have to go all the way up to 512 k

498
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,250
to actually get these things out of them

499
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,750
and then this one's slightly over 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> k</font>

500
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,760
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm only losing the bottom</font>

501
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,760
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if the other junk that was</font>

502
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,930
in here can you hold the question till

503
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,069
we get close to the end just because I

504
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,050
got a limited amount of time and I'm

505
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,050
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do demo too but I'll get</font>

506
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,220
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so so in the in the stripe as</font>

507
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,599
you're looking through the content you

508
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually see well you know in</font>

509
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:25,810
sequence the jpg is actually going to

510
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,250
look okay even if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> continued on after</font>

511
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,960
this is probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to display it</font>

512
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,150
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be crap and so that's</font>

513
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what ends up happening here and same</font>

514
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:34,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing when you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the bigger</font>

515
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,670
pitchers over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg you can start to</font>

516
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that you've got some real problems</font>

517
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,600
here with size and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

518
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,770
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up this is a large raw file so</font>

519
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,330
you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what a raw</font>

520
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,010
file is coming straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the camera</font>

521
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty large files and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

522
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,190
see you know the checkerboard status you

523
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,690
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole thing so you can start</font>

524
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,310
figuring out what your slices and then

525
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,750
once you actually get it right you're

526
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,419
actually going to see the file that

527
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,890
actually comes together so 700k file on

528
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,650
this particular one that actually did

529
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:02,020
and then I've got one other kind of

530
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,190
example let's say that you know for the

531
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">most part somebody just got like an</font>

532
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,250
iTunes library maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't find I</font>

533
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,690
mean it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be kind of hard to</font>

534
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,790
believe you won't find any JPEGs but

535
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,100
let's say they got an<font color="#E5E5E5"> iTunes library or</font>

536
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:16,240
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me let me play something</font>

537
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,740
here for you real quick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it</font>

538
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,740
will sound loud enough

539
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,629
you

540
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:48,340
I don't know where it's at here

541
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:50,050
somewhere so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you know the same</font>

542
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,149
idea happens with movies and other video

543
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:55,540
files but movies are a lot harder for it

544
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,650
to play consecutively in them so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

545
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,909
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will sound like when you get</font>

546
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">stripes eyes now depending on the</font>

547
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,930
compression inside you know you got vm<font color="#CCCCCC"> r</font>

548
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,149
you got different compression sizes for

549
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,950
mp3s it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be exactly the size you</font>

550
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,930
expect when you see it before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

551
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:15,160
but you'll get things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this where</font>

552
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:17,400
it's a mixed library and you'll get and

553
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:20,110
there's a bunch of that kind of stuff

554
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so that's kind of my basics of</font>

555
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,040
raid 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to tell you about raid 5</font>

556
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:29,970
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do the demo so we can just kind</font>

557
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:32,379
of see where it was alright so raid 5

558
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,090
you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole point is is</font>

559
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,990
that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got multiple drives and</font>

560
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,610
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to protect themselves</font>

561
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a fashion so that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this you know</font>

562
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,800
one drive dies you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> replace this one</font>

563
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,810
drive in the meantime while while things

564
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,820
are you know happening you can still run

565
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:48,010
use your server still keep on going

566
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,960
ultimately that's the point a lot of

567
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,700
people call the dr at parity drive which

568
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,350
is actually incorrect because it's a

569
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,180
distributed parody it's over all the

570
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,620
drives so you'll actually get something

571
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that looks a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more like this</font>

572
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,219
now I've simplified this enormously

573
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,159
because I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give this kind of</font>

574
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,470
speech to executives so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I made a</font>

575
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,810
flash demo to try to help them along as

576
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,890
well and it's very simplified but then

577
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll actually go into the real stuff</font>

578
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,730
i'll actually show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what it actually</font>

579
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,840
does but and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other things too</font>

580
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,430
is I want you to understand about

581
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,320
controllers this is where the difference

582
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,720
comes in between I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use my</font>

583
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,129
SATA connector on my motherboard and you

584
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,350
know put two drives together and did

585
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,030
something with a controller<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus i</font>

586
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,969
went and bought a nice you know fancy

587
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">$400</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three where drive controller so</font>

588
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,750
controllers basically the difference is

589
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not they have a process or</font>

590
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,590
not if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a processor on</font>

591
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the board there host-based they're using</font>

592
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,419
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu so if you have two hard drives</font>

593
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,250
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's trying to calculate to</font>

594
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,990
deal with this stripe size and the

595
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:46,120
content itself it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your</font>

596
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,850
processor to do it so if you have a raid

597
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 and you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three drives maybe it's</font>

598
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take up seven or eight percent</font>

599
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of your processor but you go</font>

600
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,969
stacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight drives in there the</font>

601
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,470
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of calculations that this thing</font>

602
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do to produce the</font>

603
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">parity so that you can distribute it</font>

604
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,299
across the drives<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to be</font>

605
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,559
massive it's going to be enormous so you

606
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,179
know you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys can't say why</font>

607
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't my workstation so slow i got this</font>

608
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:07,270
rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fast and all this</font>

609
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,799
other stuff it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well you know you</font>

610
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,059
got that hundred-dollar controller or

611
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,710
use the one on the motherboard and

612
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,170
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these drives that's</font>

613
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,700
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to calculate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the speed for so so</font>

614
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,260
you have your discrete controller which

615
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,570
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the processor and you have your host</font>

616
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,190
base and what's happening in software

617
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,139
when you try to reassemble raid this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

618
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,940
what takes so long is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

619
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,799
time you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through this with</font>

620
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,110
software and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go do that math</font>

621
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,580
and recalculate things and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

622
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,049
some new ways to actually in the last

623
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,820
six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the software i've</font>

624
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,950
been using has changed dramatically and

625
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can do things in minutes now compared</font>

626
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,860
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened six and seven months</font>

627
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago where i'd have to wait two hours to</font>

628
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,760
get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result so i can now actually get</font>

629
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:48,040
results in a timely manner enough to do

630
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,440
a demo in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so and here's</font>

631
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,668
the other real caveat here you gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

632
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,290
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a raid</font>

633
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:54,610
array probably to do a recovery is

634
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,740
because somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> did something else</font>

635
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,809
wrong so one drive died your system was

636
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,100
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> running and the guys just take six</font>

637
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:03,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">months before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they replace that other</font>

638
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,719
drive and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive dies right you</font>

639
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,030
guys all heard this is ridiculous right

640
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh alarm was going off but we turned it</font>

641
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,230
off and we waited oh now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford</font>

642
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,390
to drive and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else</font>

643
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,210
happens in the meantime so now here's

644
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">your real problem if no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one knows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

645
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,799
drive failed in what order because the

646
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">only one that is in sync with the good</font>

647
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,559
dr is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive that died the rest</font>

648
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,150
the other bad drive then is you know if

649
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,580
anybody has ever actually gone into the

650
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,740
raid array configuration itself and said

651
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,809
force drive online and basically it

652
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,850
resync that bad data back from the dead

653
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:38,320
the bad drive back to the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> dress</font>

654
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,969
that's what's happening it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really just</font>

655
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,340
destroying the Perrys all the

656
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:47,340
information and everything so I'm going

657
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give you my simplistic CEO version of</font>

658
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">flash</font>

659
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:02,639
we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you guys like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

660
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:04,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so here's it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit off</font>

661
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen but you'll get the point all</font>

662
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so so this is basically my four</font>

663
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,350
drives in the array and basically the

664
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,820
each slice and it's much more

665
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,129
complicated to this but ultimately the

666
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,629
pointed up me and you know the slices

667
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:17,730
are added up and then there's a parody

668
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:19,199
that's produced so we have a plus B plus

669
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,059
it's so on and so on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way down</font>

670
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you have your parody and so that's</font>

671
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:25,019
how these are all distributed across the

672
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:30,590
drive very simplistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> view but here we</font>

673
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,590
go little washed out

674
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,920
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this</font>

675
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,150
is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simplistic view of what's</font>

676
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,670
actually happened in the raid controller

677
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,160
and you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> get an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alarm but maybe not</font>

678
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:57,200
that alarm but you get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alarm you may</font>

679
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,180
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that alarm later but so one drive is</font>

680
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,290
dead came out of the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

681
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,540
understand it when you're simply looking

682
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,639
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type of formula where it you</font>

683
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,350
know a plus B equals C and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font>

684
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,120
what your ex is and you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

685
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be you can reproduce that</font>

686
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,449
fairly easily and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what actually</font>

687
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when you're actually you have a</font>

688
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,590
missing disc in your array you can

689
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,880
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> add in a blank missing missing</font>

690
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,889
disc and figure out from the

691
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,660
calculations what that content is so

692
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,480
your content doesn't exist anymore if

693
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,890
you have a drive that's dead it's

694
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,470
rebuilding that on the fly in the

695
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,810
controller or in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU to spit it</font>

696
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,580
back out to you so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

697
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,220
something in existence when you turn

698
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,449
this machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> off if it any requests that</font>

699
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,670
you make is coming back from the

700
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,370
processor<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that standpoint so now</font>

701
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:42,920
again like I said it's a little

702
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:51,080
simplistic of a view so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

703
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:53,120
what's really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

704
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so it's not really doing you know</font>

705
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,219
a plus B equals C its exclusive or een

706
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,020
these pieces together so it basically in

707
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,330
order to produce parody it takes the

708
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,920
number of drives minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> one it takes all</font>

709
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,540
of that content across the slice<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

710
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,580
exclusive or is it and then it produces

711
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,050
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> parity and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parity is what it</font>

712
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,610
writes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the disk when that's missing</font>

713
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,409
then they just do the opposite they

714
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,330
replace the parity with the other job

715
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,430
they reverse the formula and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can</font>

716
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,230
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what it's actually doing so</font>

717
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,390
it's kind of cut off here but it's you

718
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,160
know slice a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slew forward with sliced be</font>

719
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,770
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so it's doing all</font>

720
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,410
this math to recompute what it is that

721
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,420
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back as your data and there's a</font>

722
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,950
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different arrangements that</font>

723
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,680
raid arrays can actually have and

724
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,840
typically we're talking about a linux /

725
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,270
unix terminology here when we talk about

726
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,320
them in these fashions because in the

727
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,700
windows world if you're actually

728
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,960
reassembling them they're exactly the

729
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">same thing they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just have different</font>

730
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,770
names they just try to simplify it so

731
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:48,680
they'll just call standard

732
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,970
reverse to continuous and that's about

733
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,070
it so they just try to use like a

734
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:54,110
standard verbiage for this but as you

735
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,580
can see if these were your drives and

736
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,750
these were the type of slices this one's

737
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,580
typically going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered a</font>

738
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,470
standard so you'll get and it's called

739
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,360
left a synchronous then you'll actually

740
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,340
get others that are in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different order</font>

741
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,159
where the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive in the row the</font>

742
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,750
parody changes left<font color="#E5E5E5"> asynchronous then</font>

743
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,130
there's a right asynchronous I don't

744
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect people memorize them but the</font>

745
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,890
point is you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see these things</font>

746
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,930
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're actually trying to determine</font>

747
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,690
what your slices are and what your order

748
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:20,120
is so there's four<font color="#CCCCCC"> different basic ones</font>

749
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:23,600
plus all the others dynamic and so on

750
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so on so so this is basically my</font>

751
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,129
idea about steps to recover a<font color="#CCCCCC"> raid5</font>

752
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,630
array the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that most</font>

753
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,160
people go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say oh look I've got these</font>

754
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,560
you know good drives you know I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

755
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,820
dry it drives in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my array and you know</font>

756
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,830
three of them are good i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

757
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,419
image my three good drives well you just

758
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,889
wasted a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you</font>

759
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get at least one more drive back</font>

760
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,120
you don't repair it you don't do the

761
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,879
physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> rebuild</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't image it you</font>

762
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,280
got nothing because if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

763
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,480
minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> one as far as your drive so if</font>

764
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,070
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> five drives you need for</font>

765
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,080
working in order to actually get this

766
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,399
content back you're not going to get

767
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,530
anywhere you can't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

768
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,960
anything at all so don't waste time and

769
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:02,120
space trying to go image the good drives

770
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,920
focus on the bad drive if you can't get

771
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,300
the bad drive at least good enough you

772
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,770
don't have to get every sector<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it</font>

773
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,540
you don't even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all the</font>

774
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:10,160
sectors from it I mean just you know

775
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,570
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good portion of them can be</font>

776
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,460
missing and you can still actually

777
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:14,990
reassemble the content but what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

778
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,640
to happen is while you're processing in

779
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:20,090
software it won't know what to expect

780
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the software expects the content to</font>

781
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,320
be in order and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not be corrupt so the</font>

782
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,610
software will crash when it hits those

783
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,750
bad segments where they're supposed to

784
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:32,899
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in most cases it's typically try</font>

785
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,190
do extract and then after it crashes

786
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,620
restart and go through the process again

787
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,330
so so I'm at that spot where you repair

788
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,709
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks then you go back and you</font>

789
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,389
image that you know make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

790
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,700
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad drive image then you get</font>

791
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">your good drives image and then you're</font>

792
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,380
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually spit out</font>

793
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,090
this final image so there's normally a

794
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,370
process like I take these three drives

795
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,050
and I weave them back together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

796
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,479
spit out a new image so that I can

797
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,830
extract my files from it and so that's

798
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we're at right here this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

799
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,020
part we're about to do

800
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,449
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to test the data and see if</font>

801
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,190
we can figure out from the data what it

802
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,950
looks like and what your size<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff</font>

803
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,780
is now it gets really hard if you don't

804
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,000
know at least one of the exes that

805
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so your your basic</font>

806
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,680
exes are going to be you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order</font>

807
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the drives the stripes eyes and then</font>

808
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,160
the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller actually</font>

809
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,690
did whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was right</font>

810
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,190
synchronous left you know and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

811
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,870
so on most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find out</font>

812
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,490
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly about the controller so</font>

813
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,199
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that x taken care of right</font>

814
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,910
away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then if you have a limited</font>

815
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of drives let's say three drives</font>

816
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,580
in a raid array you know which one is

817
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be your first drive almost</font>

818
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">right off the bat so you only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have two</font>

819
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,980
alternatives for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two choices</font>

820
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,420
so you can figure those those pieces out

821
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,610
pretty quickly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to assume</font>

822
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:45,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get through a portion of that in</font>

823
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:47,159
order to actually make that happen so so

824
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,659
basically what we're going to do if we

825
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,340
were doing this dynamically we go create

826
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,110
our DD images and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

827
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,240
our studio I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take those DD</font>

828
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,370
images and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put them back in</font>

829
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,910
dynamically i'm going to pick my sizes

830
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,409
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the physical array itself the order</font>

831
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:03,030
of the array and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

832
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,860
extract these pictures the same as I did

833
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,330
for raid 0 it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter whether</font>

834
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,729
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing raid 0 you're doing raid 5</font>

835
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,470
there's only one change basically that

836
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,420
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make which is the order</font>

837
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,790
of the controller what the controller is

838
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,010
going to do otherwise it's exactly the

839
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,389
same process for<font color="#CCCCCC"> both of those and just</font>

840
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that there's one other way</font>

841
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,340
you can do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a standpoint of a</font>

842
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:25,949
kind of for free there is a perl script

843
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,389
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> got Mike Hardy wrote that you can</font>

844
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,650
go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can kind of modifying and do</font>

845
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,210
your own kind of thing he's got the

846
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,710
pieces already written and laid out for

847
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,750
you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can actually get your</font>

848
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,309
chunk sizes and do your own kind of

849
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:40,500
dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests and try to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

850
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:44,290
from there so so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to switch</font>

851
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:50,610
over and hopefully video and

852
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:50,610
yep five demos oh my god

853
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we're on the planet it's</font>

854
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,040
functional but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty ugly it's 79</font>

855
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,470
bucks it does standard data recovery

856
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,850
stuff it does it does all the Linux

857
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:18,790
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> e xt xt 2 3 riser it does ufs</font>

858
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:20,409
it does fat ntfs mac OS hfs+ so it

859
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,030
pretty much does everything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

860
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,940
standpoint in addition to doing raid

861
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:28,210
arrays so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 79 bucks you almost can't</font>

862
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,950
go wrong it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> assist so much like</font>

863
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,179
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't try to figure things out for</font>

864
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most part it will give you</font>

865
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,790
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and feedback and you just</font>

866
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,740
kind of have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what to do with it</font>

867
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,409
from there as a breakdown of this it's

868
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:41,140
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> our studios and you can find it</font>

869
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,730
online or whatever 79 bucks so basically

870
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your drives over here</font>

871
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,460
and then you have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information</font>

872
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:47,200
that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feed back over here</font>

873
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,970
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

874
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,010
a log basically that starts across the

875
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,290
bottom so now my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is somehow</font>

876
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,429
i created a DD image<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm assuming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

877
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,809
most of you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at this</font>

878
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:57,250
point if you don't how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a DD</font>

879
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:59,110
image you got some practice to do before

880
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get this far or you're going to use</font>

881
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,740
hardware or software or you know some

882
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:03,850
GUI or something but you'll this tool

883
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,410
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do it for you if you</font>

884
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,120
actually have a drive but if you have

885
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,559
physical damage and physical bad sectors

886
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,449
you're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggling with that</font>

887
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,309
using some things like DD rescue or

888
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,679
something like that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get your</font>

889
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">sectors back or there's a couple others</font>

890
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,809
that do like reverse imaging like my

891
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,250
rescue and DD rescue will do it too or

892
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:25,480
ftk<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftk imager things like that so now</font>

893
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,190
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do is I'm going to go</font>

894
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,020
take my DD images and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add</font>

895
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,700
them to this list so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can work</font>

896
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">with them so i'm just going to go and</font>

897
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:36,520
say open my image files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have three</font>

898
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,919
DD images that are already done now i

899
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,600
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know in this one what the</font>

900
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">order was like if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took the drives</font>

901
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,629
out when you initially took the drives

902
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,280
out if you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to number</font>

903
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,450
them for you when they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mail</font>

904
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,889
them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you or if you're not the person</font>

905
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,150
taking them out that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

906
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:51,370
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> part because you can eliminate</font>

907
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,900
most of your choices by<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you</font>

908
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,399
know the order everything else you can

909
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,350
guess at and make it pretty quick

910
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,080
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got actually rotate</font>

911
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,309
through orders all the time but so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

912
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,480
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do if you assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

913
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,280
there's there's you don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

914
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,049
order is as well so i'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

915
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,299
these three images and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

916
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:09,668
these three images to my list and so

917
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:10,260
right away from me just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys know</font>

918
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:12,240
on the

919
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,350
one I used a high point controller so I

920
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,010
used a high point it's a raid 5 or a

921
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,209
high point controller 374 or something

922
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,360
like that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chipset it's the whole</font>

923
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:28,410
set they sell it's also made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into the</font>

924
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:30,000
adapt x very few of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the raid five jobs</font>

925
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,940
will have a signature either at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

926
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,310
beginning a dollar a will there's a few

927
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a few of them will but for the</font>

928
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,220
most part you're not going to get a

929
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,780
signature there's an HP<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate array that</font>

930
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,130
will have a signature but most time you

931
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,500
won't know your order still<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to kind</font>

932
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,540
of figure that out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know right away</font>

933
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,730
I've got a partition one that it says it

934
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,040
found an NTFS signature for so i know i

935
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:53,150
have an NTFS volume here and i have

936
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,200
three eight gig drives in a row and

937
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,240
depending on numbering or whatever so

938
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've got these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three images added to my</font>

939
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,860
stuff so now i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create we have</font>

940
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:03,030
a choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> here if i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing depending</font>

941
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">on which one I actually want to do</font>

942
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,520
whether or not i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a virtual</font>

943
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,990
stripe set or a raid fiber ray and the

944
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,580
volume sets so you have your choices

945
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,310
from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup basically what we're</font>

946
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,290
going to do is dynamically create a fake

947
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,480
kind of raid array in software is what

948
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,800
we're going to do so if i was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 or</font>

949
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,350
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd use one of the one of the</font>

950
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,930
others but i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a raid 5 so</font>

951
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:27,750
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i make a raid 5 array it just</font>

952
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:29,460
creates this fake drive that shows up

953
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,720
here in the middle and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

954
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,090
obvious what you can do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

955
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,440
kind of a it will to<font color="#CCCCCC"> drag and drop kind</font>

956
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,540
of stuff but it's kind of painful it's a

957
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,160
lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if i come over here</font>

958
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,470
and I say okay fine i'm on my virtual

959
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,120
raid 5 and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking me questions over</font>

960
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,770
here now I've got boxes i can try to

961
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,229
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to do i can</font>

962
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,710
right click and the important part here

963
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,390
is that yes i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see my partition but</font>

964
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:53,450
my partition is going to be at an offset

965
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,160
so my partition is going to be 63

966
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,570
sectors into the drive so I don't want

967
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,000
to add the partition I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

968
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,770
physical disks if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have one</font>

969
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,470
that has an offset like maybe the dull

970
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,060
raid array has 128 k offset you can

971
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,650
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> set that it'll be over here in</font>

972
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,940
the right hand side but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font>

973
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,220
to do that now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down</font>

974
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say oh look I've got a raid 1 i've</font>

975
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,730
got the first drive i'm going to add it

976
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,918
so when i add it it'll remove it from my

977
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and then over on the right you'll</font>

978
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,089
see an offset if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decided that i needed</font>

979
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,918
an offset maybe for the first drive or

980
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,540
each individual drive i can choose that

981
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,819
over there

982
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,020
so again back to the controller you go

983
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,630
when you look it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you figure out</font>

984
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that's going to be then I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

985
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,160
add my next drive so you'll see first

986
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,440
there's also a choice at the top AB

987
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,210
missing disc so in a raid<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 you're</font>

988
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,190
missing one disc but you've got to disk

989
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,860
you can dynamically rebuild it here in

990
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,690
software and you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my this the</font>

991
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,460
other one now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray and it has removed</font>

992
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,050
it from my list so now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font>

993
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,990
just go down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> select the others and</font>

994
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:54,620
just add all of the ones I want to my

995
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:56,779
array and I can shuffle them around move

996
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,279
them up and down I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn them on and</font>

997
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,840
off they actually have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> on/off button</font>

998
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,150
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the equivalent to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power and</font>

999
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,710
turning it off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then adding your</font>

1000
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,050
offsets and stuff but what you'll notice

1001
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:09,140
here is that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away has given me</font>

1002
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,000
kind of a dynamic configuration and I

1003
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,230
can do a couple of things like I can

1004
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,300
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I make a change</font>

1005
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,950
automatically apply all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes to</font>

1006
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,130
whatever I'm doing in my data recovery

1007
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,750
so i can test like multiple sequences of

1008
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,280
tests and it'll just dynamically change

1009
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,310
them on the fly for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have</font>

1010
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do anything and then you'll see this</font>

1011
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,790
is based on the drive so drive one drive

1012
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,890
to drive three and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slice</font>

1013
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,330
sizes themselves and you can move them

1014
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">around like you can actually go here and</font>

1015
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,400
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on them and you can decide which</font>

1016
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,770
drive it's going to be the the parody

1017
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,530
like so for instance well you know the

1018
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,940
exclusive or of the slices equals parody

1019
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,440
well they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you an</font>

1020
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,580
indication here if they're pink they

1021
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,190
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you right here it's an invalid</font>

1022
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:51,770
block order so if there's a pink box

1023
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,690
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that what if you</font>

1024
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,700
selected this number and it was in this

1025
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">row that that parity is going to be</font>

1026
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,419
wrong and so your calculations not going

1027
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,250
to work so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

1028
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,230
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if you wanted to you can still</font>

1029
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,430
force your own choose your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own do</font>

1030
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:06,500
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it will let you do it</font>

1031
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,730
all on your own but it's trying to hint

1032
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,800
and give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1033
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:12,440
calculation and doing some some work for

1034
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so at least it's letting you know</font>

1035
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's say all right fine for</font>

1036
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,440
the sake of time I could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through each</font>

1037
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of these sizes but you can see that</font>

1038
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's already given me all my sizes for</font>

1039
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,049
my choices and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep choosing</font>

1040
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,940
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the default</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is most of</font>

1041
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,990
the time 64 so most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'm</font>

1042
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start with that and then try to</font>

1043
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,259
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out whether i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go</font>

1044
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,110
higher or lower and you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1045
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,520
quick if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 512k or something like</font>

1046
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,339
that because all your pictures will look

1047
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,229
good under under 512k

1048
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:41,299
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up really fast and you'll be</font>

1049
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:43,700
able to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's going on so</font>

1050
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,499
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to leave it at 64 K and let's</font>

1051
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">just assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that its standard if I</font>

1052
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:48,919
didn't know any better I would just say

1053
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:51,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's standard and I have three rows</font>

1054
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,420
the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now over</font>

1055
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:56,299
here on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand side it is now</font>

1056
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,769
made me my fake partition and it's now

1057
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,180
the size that it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1058
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:01,578
because I've added the drives together

1059
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,259
and so its bounding them all together in

1060
00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:06,559
their fashion and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll see that i</font>

1061
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:08,269
have this 15.7 gig drive over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1062
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">can click on this drive and there's a</font>

1063
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:13,160
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1064
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:14,690
add this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one slower step here I can</font>

1065
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,879
right click on this job and I can say

1066
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,089
okay fine I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test on my own</font>

1067
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,920
visually what what kind of recovery that

1068
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:26,119
I'm getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so I can go and hit</font>

1069
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,529
scan now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big deal here is if you</font>

1070
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,359
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an operating system on your disk</font>

1071
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:31,430
and you have say the mft you have a

1072
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,839
catalog of your disk normally you could

1073
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:34,640
just go look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the catalog and you can</font>

1074
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:36,200
say oh look let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go see where these</font>

1075
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,029
files are and these clusters are and

1076
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,549
reassemble them without scanning your

1077
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:42,410
hard drive the mft is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> catalog of</font>

1078
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,839
where your files are and has their names

1079
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,729
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything they're scanning is</font>

1080
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:48,710
actually the slower process which says

1081
00:37:46,729 --> 00:37:51,439
hey I've got a file header and I know

1082
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,989
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe a JPEG has this file string</font>

1083
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,960
FF d 8 FF and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1084
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:58,729
that jpg file and cut it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and spit</font>

1085
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,739
out a file you guys give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so far</font>

1086
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:02,359
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I mean so there's these</font>

1087
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,380
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different methods most people don't</font>

1088
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">know when they start their software</font>

1089
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,759
which one they're using or even you know

1090
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,259
thought about it but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time if</font>

1091
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:11,299
it scans the disk and it takes 20

1092
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:14,569
minutes an hour three days to produce

1093
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:17,239
you a tree it scanned it did not use the

1094
00:38:14,569 --> 00:38:19,460
mft or the catalog or on HFS there's

1095
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:20,869
actually a catalog that just shows you

1096
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,519
your files that would actually work in a

1097
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:25,239
minute you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say show it to me</font>

1098
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and let me see what i got in this</font>

1099
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:29,749
situation from this standpoint I already

1100
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:32,779
know I got ntfs I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scan for</font>

1101
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:34,549
HFS or fat or EXT so it'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take me</font>

1102
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:37,640
more time if I leave those enabled so

1103
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:39,079
I'm just going to turn those off I'm

1104
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,479
gonna leave those alone and I'm going to

1105
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">go for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some file types and so I'm going</font>

1106
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:44,629
to say I will only<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to look for</font>

1107
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:46,189
these file types not the hundred that

1108
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,900
are selected by default almost every

1109
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,579
application has these two or three

1110
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,840
hundred that are selected by default and

1111
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:52,400
they try everything

1112
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,980
I just want a quick answer so I'm going

1113
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go down to my graphics tab I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1114
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find you know my jpg in</font>

1115
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,130
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital camera pictures that's all</font>

1116
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,339
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to select or mp3 is going to</font>

1117
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:06,200
do that we're a movie and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font>

1118
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,390
that and say okay in this case I'm going

1119
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a detailed view simple view does</font>

1120
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,730
not refresh the screen it just it just

1121
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,080
does the job until it's done and you can

1122
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,940
stop it but you won't know where you're

1123
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,460
at in this tool if I still leave

1124
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,830
detailed done I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see when it</font>

1125
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,360
finds files<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

1126
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:24,770
JPEGs and so I'll know when I have

1127
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's valuable for me to look</font>

1128
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,330
at so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to leave detail and i</font>

1129
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,950
wanna say scan and so it'll switch to

1130
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,380
this screen here where it's going block

1131
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:35,450
by block and as it finds stuff it's

1132
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,340
telling you down here now which files

1133
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,259
and what it's looking for and even while

1134
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's scanning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like hover over</font>

1135
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,940
a box and they'll tell me oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i found two</font>

1136
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,009
files here that i was asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if i</font>

1137
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,080
keep on going i can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1138
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,240
however many<font color="#CCCCCC"> file specific documents and</font>

1139
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,160
if i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what they are i can</font>

1140
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,490
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them and they'll tell me in a</font>

1141
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,680
list what they are and in many cases

1142
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,270
sometimes it's crashes open in hex

1143
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,830
editor it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes and looks at the</font>

1144
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:02,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">disk and tries to pull it up so maybe I</font>

1145
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:06,410
got a false positive or I got something

1146
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:08,000
huh yeah this is doing it read only now

1147
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:10,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are plugged into an operating system</font>

1148
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,510
that knows how to make changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1149
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:14,240
windows may make changes or something

1150
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,290
else may make changes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on a DD</font>

1151
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,899
image so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making any</font>

1152
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:20,060
modifications to the DD image so this is

1153
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">read-only at this at this segment here</font>

1154
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go and pull it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1155
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:25,490
actually get you know my jpg header and

1156
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,440
I know it to jpg it's not a false

1157
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,819
positive you know you could even go down

1158
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,860
and go further and see if there was

1159
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,020
actually any<font color="#CCCCCC"> X F information so i</font>

1160
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:35,390
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have x f information so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

1161
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,970
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> what my cannon was in blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

1162
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,290
so it's a fight it is a pitcher so that

1163
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:41,569
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm pretty good i can actually</font>

1164
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop this now and say screw this i don't</font>

1165
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,190
want to wait five hours so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

1166
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,750
stopped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just stops this process</font>

1167
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,370
and then it will come down here and give

1168
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,800
you extra files found now there's two

1169
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,359
things recognized means i found an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft</font>

1170
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,940
and maybe i can tell you something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1171
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,500
the catalog itself but the extra files

1172
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,240
are what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the</font>

1173
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:02,180
things that scanned for so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1174
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and pull up extra files and it just</font>

1175
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,580
parts us through and says okay fine

1176
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,380
here's one

1177
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,420
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can go and see your list</font>

1178
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,960
of whatever the files are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

1179
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,000
pick a file and click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now you can</font>

1180
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,090
see right away that looking at this I

1181
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,950
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> something wrong now it is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

1182
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,300
typically the same picture if you look

1183
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this one you can tell look this</font>

1184
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,480
segments the same this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same this</font>

1185
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the same as same picture it's not</font>

1186
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not from another slice it's</font>

1187
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,230
not from<font color="#E5E5E5"> some place that's off so I'm</font>

1188
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,839
probably right on my slice sighs I'm

1189
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,310
probably wrong about the order because

1190
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,620
the there are still parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1191
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,330
picture you can see parts of my video

1192
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,540
collection and stuff in here in the same

1193
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,340
slices so in this case I know that more

1194
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,410
than likely my order is incorrect and

1195
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,910
not my slice size because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not from</font>

1196
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,980
a different pitcher so it makes sense

1197
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,750
you guys give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so far so now</font>

1198
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,850
here's where the benefit of a program

1199
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,040
like this comes in pretty handy and you

1200
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,540
know live demos it's all the same it's

1201
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,640
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show me my scan information</font>

1202
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,290
over here to actually make changes after

1203
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,730
I've actually scans and vials I can

1204
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have to go back up to my raid</font>

1205
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,840
array and I have to make changes so if I

1206
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,370
know that I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> good with 64k I</font>

1207
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,650
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do the drop down box and</font>

1208
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,359
switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next arrangement or remove</font>

1209
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,980
them myself manually if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

1210
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,540
shuffle them around so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one in</font>

1211
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,790
the choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's these for the standards</font>

1212
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,310
I would stick with these these standards

1213
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,050
or move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to a custom one but so left</font>

1214
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,420
synchronous continuous is my next<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice</font>

1215
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:25,250
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to select that one and then</font>

1216
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,260
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got apply all changes</font>

1217
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:30,290
immediately this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where demos go wrong</font>

1218
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,900
I when I actually go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my extra</font>

1219
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,120
files found it redid the list i already

1220
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:37,520
had I don't have to rescan or continue

1221
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,440
on it read put them back together in its

1222
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,250
order so I'll go pick the file that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1223
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,460
actually had in fam and so in a few

1224
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">seconds I can try to figure out visually</font>

1225
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,360
where I stand with these rather than

1226
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:53,600
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use some fancy $10,000 raid</font>

1227
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:58,520
reconstructor blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah same</font>

1228
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:02,480
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> raid 0 anything so and for 79</font>

1229
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,480
bucks I mean come on really so so that

1230
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,840
was my demo that's what I have any

1231
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,840
questions

1232
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:25,129
yes the drobo is actually a very

1233
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:26,599
intelligent device though because you

1234
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,000
can put drives in there are different

1235
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,980
sizes it will dynamically change the

1236
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,410
type of raid that it uses on the fly so

1237
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">it will actually figure out now if you</font>

1238
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,368
put four drives into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same size they</font>

1239
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:39,740
automatically our raid<font color="#CCCCCC"> five if there any</font>

1240
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:41,900
other order they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different I mean</font>

1241
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,700
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I want to stick with the raid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

1242
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,960
because I trusted I know what it is and

1243
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,788
I know they have some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> robust</font>

1244
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,799
formulas and I've done recoveries from

1245
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:50,089
them before not that there's a problem

1246
00:43:48,799 --> 00:43:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that because I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done them from</font>

1247
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:55,069
everything so but but I mean I like the

1248
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:02,750
devices I think it's a very quick and

1249
00:43:55,069 --> 00:44:04,038
easy simple way yeah yeah I mean I don't

1250
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're saying wrong said I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1251
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:08,900
don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't tell</font>

1252
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,430
you what raid you know what the layout

1253
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,020
is that it's using it won't tell you i'm

1254
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,220
using a mirror or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm using it you'll</font>

1255
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of guess because you'll</font>

1256
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,129
know what your sizes are and what the

1257
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,079
output was so you can kind of calculate

1258
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,180
what that is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't like that i</font>

1259
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,220
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's my problem is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1260
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,779
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raid5 i know i</font>

1261
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,640
can reconstruct it if you screw it up

1262
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:27,140
sore your machine smoked and I don't

1263
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,940
need it because sometimes what happens

1264
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,680
is five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the road you've still</font>

1265
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,119
got that device but no one else<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1266
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that device anymore and if it smokes</font>

1267
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:35,270
that's what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of</font>

1268
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lacey drives I've got like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a collection</font>

1269
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the back of all the boards that are</font>

1270
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,849
custom and because those lacy drives a

1271
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,770
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are custom and you end up</font>

1272
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:45,349
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that has like four plugs on it</font>

1273
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:47,180
it's it's it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be standard so you</font>

1274
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,770
need to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that working bored to</font>

1275
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,868
actually get it running again I want to

1276
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what it's doing I don't want to be</font>

1277
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:53,599
like the guy who buys it at the store

1278
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:56,359
and says raid on the box and its really

1279
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,490
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AIDS so that's that doesn't work</font>

1280
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:00,490
those are photographers by the way yeah

1281
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,440
right well when you're doing your

1282
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,330
physical recovery like I actually use

1283
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,100
several devices like I use a deep hard

1284
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,230
disk imager it'll actually give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1285
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,720
report of the sectors that I have errors

1286
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:27,670
on and so i will know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many I have</font>

1287
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,200
and so instead of testing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1288
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,340
pitcher like I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> shown you know</font>

1289
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,720
I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone through 20 pitchers</font>

1290
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,960
but I didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for time whether we</font>

1291
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,339
make it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I could I you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1292
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at multiple pictures to try to</font>

1293
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,890
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out if you're looking at</font>

1294
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is corrupt and then you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

1295
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like I just did when</font>

1296
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,910
I said oh yeah it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannon or</font>

1297
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,910
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a false positive</font>

1298
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,009
because you can have FF d 8 f F in a row

1299
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a false positive and not</font>

1300
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:53,020
even be a picture and be something else

1301
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:55,060
or encryption for that standpoint but so

1302
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,009
if you get a list like this like I got a

1303
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,049
pretty robust list I could just keep

1304
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,940
going down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures until you know I</font>

1305
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,430
feel confident<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1306
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,170
five or ten good ones versus five or ten

1307
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,819
bad ones whether or not it's actually a

1308
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,860
picture or not or it's a false positive

1309
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,030
or you know switch to gifs and do

1310
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,160
something small and see if you can

1311
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,540
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get something small back you</font>

1312
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,740
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of start figuring that</font>

1313
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,820
out a little bit but most of the time

1314
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,890
you look at physical damage you're

1315
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,140
looking at a drive that most of the time

1316
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,120
it's a like a DM a problem like there's

1317
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,580
actually a memory problem on the device

1318
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,040
itself and when data is transferred on a

1319
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:29,110
hard drive into the drives memory like

1320
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,580
you have a 2 Meg cash it transfers it

1321
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,170
into there it actually has corruption

1322
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,420
coming out of there over the bus<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

1323
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,670
your device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can switch to pio mode</font>

1324
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,320
or you can do it in reverse when you do

1325
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,360
it in reverse it doesn't actually use

1326
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,910
the cash in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same method it only</font>

1327
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,470
transfers one segment at a time and you

1328
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,580
can actually in some cases choose how

1329
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,169
much you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write out from the</font>

1330
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:51,009
buffer so it's not going across the bus

1331
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:53,410
with 256 bytes at a time so there's a

1332
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:56,290
way to do that but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

1333
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,879
little bit before this so but i'll be

1334
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,890
happy to go through it or go watch my

1335
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:05,760
videos too i've got like 50 hours online

1336
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,759
of that of all that so

1337
00:47:08,299 --> 00:47:16,230
yes yeah no problem there right you can

1338
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it out I'll actually tell</font>

1339
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,130
you or give you some feedback on that as

1340
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,868
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes and like I said even for</font>

1341
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,460
like dynamic you know it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1342
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:25,079
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feedback right away I don't</font>

1343
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,490
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go searching for it like some</font>

1344
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,619
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually whip open</font>

1345
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">out hex editor like if you wanted to try</font>

1346
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:31,710
this in a higher in package like<font color="#CCCCCC"> x ways</font>

1347
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,328
forensics or something it'll actually

1348
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,770
give you more feedback as well you'll

1349
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:37,559
actually be able to tell and do this in

1350
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:39,480
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of seconds as well and runtime</font>

1351
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:41,280
suite is very similar to this they

1352
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,140
actually have a virtual image<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1353
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,420
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the demo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no this amount of</font>

1354
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">time you can do the same thing and run</font>

1355
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,960
times it'll do the entropy test it'll

1356
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,549
try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the order even though</font>

1357
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't tell you it's right if it</font>

1358
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:55,200
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can figure out what it</font>

1359
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,460
is pretty quickly and dynamically open

1360
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,740
it in something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is like a</font>

1361
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,170
hex editor you can parse through through

1362
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTFS because every ntfs records only</font>

1363
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:04,079
1024 bytes and you can actually figure

1364
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:06,299
out from the records in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cluster</font>

1365
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:12,990
where the jpg is and what you want to

1366
00:48:06,299 --> 00:48:14,730
test pretty quickly yes it matters from

1367
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,680
the order there's like five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

1368
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,809
different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they the controller</font>

1369
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,839
does things with offsets and then the

1370
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:23,520
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the order of the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1371
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:26,279
which one they chose from the order

1372
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,240
standpoint yes it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

1373
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,950
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an adapted versus you know</font>

1374
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,419
three where they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different you have</font>

1375
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look them up and find out from the</font>

1376
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,930
spec which one they're using if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1377
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:43,770
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information I don't know off</font>

1378
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:45,149
the top of my head<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean son I mean</font>

1379
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,530
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look and see from a</font>

1380
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,910
standpoint oh but I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> still actually</font>

1381
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:50,970
extract a picture and try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1382
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:53,549
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from its format but yeah ufs file</font>

1383
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,589
system yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yodeled the ufs to this</font>

1384
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:57,509
won't be a problem with UF x by x if you

1385
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">use an ex FS is a nightmare because you</font>

1386
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">can only scan you can't use the catalog</font>

1387
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,970
because nothing's supporting the catalog

1388
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,400
right now and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same problem</font>

1389
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,419
with ZFS accepted ZFS fragments the data

1390
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and moves it around so you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

1391
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,450
know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> on ZFS and then you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

1392
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one more step you've got to</font>

1393
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:14,279
spit out the image and then take the

1394
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:16,980
image to a to a machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font>

1395
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,819
ZFS and mount the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

1396
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,490
extracted and then go look for your JPEG

1397
00:49:19,819 --> 00:49:23,770
because it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

1398
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:26,410
to understand it so in XFS and ZFS we've

1399
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:27,580
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple more steps but yes wait and</font>

1400
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:44,850
they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure we'll get</font>

1401
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:44,850
something yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you which one</font>

1402
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:49,210
okay go ahead I'm on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

1403
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:08,000
yeah well yeah your problem is always

1404
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,470
the unknown portion they you know it's

1405
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,450
like not knowing the controller not

1406
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:13,040
knowing how to dynamically get it not I

1407
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,930
mean but you've never seen any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

1408
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,120
guys discussing this method either but

1409
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:20,600
unless you don't know this already they

1410
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">hired me for the SEC 606 so I'm teaching</font>

1411
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:28,549
this now for sands<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting in June so</font>

1412
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,410
maybe they'll write about it I don't

1413
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:31,730
know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1414
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:33,560
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1415
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,300
say is you know I'm gonna blow by it

1416
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,920
really easy this may still take<font color="#CCCCCC"> me two</font>

1417
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,270
weeks actually get to this spot I've got

1418
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,800
you the physical repair I've got to do

1419
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:42,650
the images I've got to take them a visit

1420
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:45,770
physically I mean if you take I mean

1421
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:48,170
Scott I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this from his from</font>

1422
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:49,550
his raid array if you can saturate the

1423
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,630
raid array and you can have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of</font>

1424
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,430
problems and you have the same problem

1425
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,600
when I you know on a laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go hook up</font>

1426
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">four drives and actually try to</font>

1427
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:59,029
reassemble a raid array we're talking

1428
00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">some cpu power here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I oh so you've</font>

1429
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,550
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have you've got to have some</font>

1430
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,810
through foot you've got to be able to do

1431
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and they'll still take your week spit</font>

1432
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,870
out an image my whole point is to I want

1433
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,970
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have to spit out an</font>

1434
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:10,250
image of the all the hard drives weed

1435
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,109
back together unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a good idea</font>

1436
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it because you used to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1437
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,830
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week spit it out look at it</font>

1438
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,390
figure out if you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right thing go</font>

1439
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,130
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drawing board and do it</font>

1440
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:21,410
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and two months later you are</font>

1441
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,820
whipping out your final image before you

1442
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,930
actually have the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's</font>

1443
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in forensics is they had a</font>

1444
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,690
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive they already knew it was good</font>

1445
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,919
they knew it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> symbol but they did</font>

1446
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,050
not know what it was after they made

1447
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:35,560
images of these physical disks but you

1448
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:38,210
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all the time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1449
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,140
yes this is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1450
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">order is and you don't know what the</font>

1451
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,580
configuration is this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how you</font>

1452
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,770
doing it this is a physical example of

1453
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:48,440
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go through that process</font>

1454
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:50,180
so at least I mean I kind of made it up

1455
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,880
so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anybody else is doing</font>

1456
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:56,210
it but it worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me on thousands of</font>

1457
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:59,320
garage so I mean I've done probably 500

1458
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,320
raid arrays this year so

1459
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:03,430
yeah well I mean I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what</font>

1460
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:06,009
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was looking for I could look at the</font>

1461
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,180
JPEGs and I can tell that so and you

1462
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,500
know when you're missing something to

1463
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,690
you know right away when something's

1464
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,920
wrong so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got to drive any other day</font>

1465
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:12,880
and they said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just one drive and</font>

1466
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,650
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it and I'm going well</font>

1467
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,360
their stripes I mean it's not one drive

1468
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:18,100
and she's like oh yeah well he said it

1469
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,480
was a mirror well it ain't a mirror go

1470
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,759
get the other drive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> break it back</font>

1471
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,110
because it's a and that happens all the

1472
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,820
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> two people go it's a mirror it's</font>

1473
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,610
not a mirror otherwise we wouldn't be

1474
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:32,470
doing a recovery for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably so</font>

1475
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:35,010
that's great any Sam I know you had

1476
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:41,620
something ma'am you gotta say something

1477
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:43,330
okay I don't these people we know who I

1478
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:45,220
am so it has nothing to do with this

1479
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,299
software it's the same process even if

1480
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,919
you use run times or something now I

1481
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,300
know the guys at runtime and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

1482
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,650
is really great but it does take a

1483
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,900
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

1484
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:54,370
you're going to produce so when they're

1485
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,660
like I said when their software is right

1486
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,310
they tried to do an entropy test and

1487
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:59,529
when it's right it is right it tells you

1488
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:02,080
flat out it's right it's green if it's

1489
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">not right you have to guess it doesn't</font>

1490
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,360
mean it won't work it just means they

1491
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:09,430
tell you it's not right so or in you

1492
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,280
know in case explains forensics they do

1493
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:13,629
similar things but they treat you like

1494
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,180
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're doing they</font>

1495
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:20,440
guess and if they're wrong you're stuck

1496
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:24,210
that's the problem so anything else you

1497
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,210
guys good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
