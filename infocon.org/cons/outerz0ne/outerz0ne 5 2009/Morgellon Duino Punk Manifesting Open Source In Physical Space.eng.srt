one show a month and we've got daily

109
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:16,909
content so we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to pimp that</font>

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:19,880
out let's see hello arduino i'm going to

111
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arduino the Arduino is a</font>

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,300
microcontroller platform it's this is a

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,690
middle ground for hardware and software

114
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,840
this is kind of where the two meet it's

115
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,419
a good it's a good playground for people

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,599
who know a little code or no software

117
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,940
are no hardware or vice versa or even if

118
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:44,690
you don't know anything at all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

119
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,719
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and I had</font>

120
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:53,719

let me borrow this wonderful epc so i

123
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,198
could give this presentation otherwise

124
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'd have no slides and it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font>

really can't see it that's the physical

127
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,349
schematic for the Arduino I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,610
going to dwell on that on this top

129
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:21,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UH the Arduino is a cool platform</font>

130
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,090
because it simplifies electronics you

131
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,909
know what let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me back up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I get</font>

doing knows why Arduino is awesome why

134
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,310
should you get into a hardware hacking

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we live at a point in time where we</font>

136
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,190
have access to a level of technology the

137
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,670
level of possibilities that we have and

138
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:47,210
are the surrounds us as far as even junk

139

is amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is stuff</font>

140
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:54,140
that would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible 20 30 50</font>

141
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,850
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should get in and</font>

142
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,070
start doing some of this hardware

143
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,840
hacking and the open source community as

144
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,250
far as Linux you've got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

145
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together put little</font>

146
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,890
snippets of code together to get

147
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,780
projects going it all kind of comes

148
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,550
together in meshes I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

149
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,330
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that get together with</font>

150
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,700
the hardware as far as wow I wish I had

151
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,390
a device that did<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and I could get</font>

152
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,150
online and find apart lists a little bit

153
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,520
of code slap<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all together much like I</font>

154
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,500
would compile some code or get the

155
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,000
different dependencies put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

156
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,220
together now I've got a nice little

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,920
program same thing now I've got a nice

158
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:39,890
little Wi-Fi scanner or something like

159
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:43,640
that so that's why but the the Arduino

160
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:46,430
is a it's a microcontroller platform it

161
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:49,940
works on its digital electronics which

162
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,910
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on 5 volt logic</font>

163
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,940
which is good it's low power runs off

164
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:59,480
batteries can't can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself hurt</font>

165
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:04,610
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of parts available let's</font>

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:07,040
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 5 volt logic basically</font>

167
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">5 volt logic is a way of sending yes or</font>

168
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,350
nose in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital environment you have</font>

169
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes or no there is no middle ground</font>

170
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,250
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in-between so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

171
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,160
the the Arduino sends a higher low or a

172
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:27,320
true or false or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 or 0</font>

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,310
to signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> communications is by this</font>

174
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:36,830
voltage range so if i wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send 20</font>

175
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:39,580
or in a low signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have in the</font>

176
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:42,200
low range those<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero volts 2.8</font>

177
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,050
eight-tenths of a volt and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font>

178
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send a high that's in a signal of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

179
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,740
volts to 5 volts

180
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:10,460
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino down here terrible</font>

181
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,900
everybody can't see I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font>

182
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,880
little program hooked up right here not

183
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,829
being very clear at all I apologize I've

184
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,390
really lost all meant everything that I

185
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,180
had set up I'm kind of running by the

186
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,689
fly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an example care about</font>

187
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,729
here okay this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of why I'm</font>

188
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,370
attracted to the Arduino I've got the

189
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,560
Rock Band drum kit set up right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

190
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,590
what I've done is I've interfaced into

191
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,979
it with the Arduino The Rock Band drum

192
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:42,170
kit it's got knock sensors which is

193
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,900
basically a pizzo speaker full

194
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,760
experience it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those hooked up</font>

195
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,040
backwards and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hook it up</font>

196
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,530
backwards and yeah smack it it generates

197
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,180
a small amount of voltage and then

198
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,339
that's what they're using to read that

199
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,530
little bit of voltage to know hey you

200
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">whack the drum what I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

201
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,880
hacking into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USB controller and all</font>

202
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,120
that I left that alone and what I did is

203
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,860
actually well if you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

204
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,960
afterwards I can pop it open but

205
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,820
actually just popped open each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

206
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,550
the drums<font color="#E5E5E5"> and salt it on to the little</font>

207
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,220
knock sensor itself and brought some

208
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,310
extra wire out so I've still got the

209
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,260
full functionality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drum set it's</font>

210
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,810
a playstation 3 version so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still</font>

211
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,230
hook it up and it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> works but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

212
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:32,959
also got the added functionality of I

213
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:36,290
don't know if you will see but when I

214
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,630
smack the appropriate color drum I get

215
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,870
the appropriate color light that comes

216
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,840
on and it's not going to change the

217
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:47,720
world it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing you know but</font>

218
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,570
it's it's a fun project that took me you

219
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,850
know maybe maybe a couple hours as far

220
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,790
as trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to get the</font>

221
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,220
drum apart without destroying it you

222
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,900
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hooking up the multimeter to</font>

223
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,210
figure out what the polarity of the

224
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:06,470
sensors were make sure I had the right

225
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading I'm a hardware guy code is my</font>

226
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">extreme weakness it's what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font>

227
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,180
right now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so it takes me more</font>

228
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,500
time to write the code than it does to

229
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,770
put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff together</font>

230
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:24,770
so I have the code and I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

231
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:28,579
show you this right here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino</font>

232
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDE it is based off of the processing</font>

233
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,880
environment which I'll bounce back to in

234
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:38,720
the middle but the language<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pseudo</font>

235
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,650
c language it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real language but</font>

236
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:45,200
it's it's very similar to see so some

237
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,600
people get snobby about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm all about</font>

238
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,850
it's easy to write with it's easy to

239
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,800
work with I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be an expert I</font>

240
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,280
can get in I can make my lights blink

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,790
and my life is happy so what I've done

242
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,339
is this is the code that is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

243
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:05,030
basically what I've done is I've

244
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:08,240
declared a couple pins for what my

245
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,010
output LEDs are going to be and then

246
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what I'm doing is I'm</font>

247
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,400
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a small amount of voltage</font>

248
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,349
on each one and I'm sure there's

249
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,420
probably so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much better way to do this</font>

250
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,750
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code but I'm basically just doing</font>

251
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,790
a short loop hey is there anything on

252
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,420
coming in on any one of these lines the

253
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,670
delay value is in microseconds so that's

254
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,490
75 I'm sorry milliseconds not

255
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:42,170
microseconds but it's fast enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

256
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:47,480
where you can actually see what you can

257
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:50,030
actually you know so it's it's enough to

258
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">where even my bad code can get the</font>

259
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,470
almost multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> input so no I can't</font>

260
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,950
smack two of them at the same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

261
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:02,810
get them the light but within 75

262
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:07,390
milliseconds yeah so good enough another

263
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:11,329
part that I like that I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun with is</font>

264
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,939
it can output to serial so the Arduino

265
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,770
is communicating over USB we hook it up

266
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,740
through USB or serial port in my case

267
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,780
it's through USB but it does all the

268
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,590
communication over the serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> port which</font>

269
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,900
is really

270
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,300
meaning because that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

271
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,370
sudden I've got a way to interface all

272
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,650
this hardware with the computer and

273
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,750
software in a very easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> manner because</font>

274
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,209
it's all going over cereal so this is

275
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">very cool so what I've got going on here</font>

276
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:44,360
is when I hit whatever appropriate one

277
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,849
let me get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way but yeah you</font>

278
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,970
see that the value changes and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

279
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:53,990
lightly tap it I get a low value enough

280
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,240
up smack<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I get a higher value because</font>

281
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,360
I'm generating more voltage when I smack

282
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,780
it so you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that I</font>

283
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,060
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface into with the lights so</font>

284
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,339
I could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when I smack the drum</font>

285
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,619
harder the lights are brighter or I

286
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:13,820
could interface it with some software to

287
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,830
you know post more or have a string of

288
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,810
LEDs that the harder you hit so there's

289
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:22,210
a lot more fun you could just keep kind

290
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:22,209
of expanding upon and rolling with

291
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,330
if we have

292
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:45,460
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have</font>

293
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,750
liked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have already working but I</font>

294
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:50,110
didn't have time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it all going</font>

295
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,330
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple if the</font>

296
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">video load basically a sample of</font>

297
00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:06,640
processing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino communicating the</font>

298
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">arduino ide and processing are the same</font>

299
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing so they look very similar</font>

300
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:15,690
processing is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist's language so</font>

301
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:25,360
it's kind of designed for more of the

302
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:27,010
visual creative process so the video

303
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,110
would load basically what you're going

304
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see is I've got the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino and a</font>

305
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,840
little yellow LED and on the screen with

306
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,300
a processing I've generated a little

307
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,250
square it's like a 200 pixel<font color="#CCCCCC"> by 200</font>

308
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,699
pixels<font color="#E5E5E5"> square but when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse moves</font>

309
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,680
over that square it lights the LED and

310
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,340
that's that's all it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing it's</font>

311
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:53,050
nothing fancy but it's the basic as far

312
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:55,810
as what's going on is the Arduino is

313
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,880
listening on the serial port<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

314
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,250
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something changing the state of</font>

315
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,780
the LED based on what's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

316
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:07,120
serial port so with processing when my

317
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,209
mouse is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not over that square it's black</font>

318
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,160
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending out the letter L over</font>

319
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,890
the serial port<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when I move my mouse</font>

320
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,959
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes that pixel area it</font>

321
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,300
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the color to yellow and it sends</font>

322
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,370
out an<font color="#E5E5E5"> H over the serial port</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

323
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,189
when it are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh detects an H on the</font>

324
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,370
serial<font color="#CCCCCC"> port and lights up the LED it's</font>

325
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,290
real simple basic code but uh you can

326
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,900
interface into a whole lot of languages

327
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:38,680
with this so we're talking we can get in

328
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:40,930
to see PHP Ruby just goes on and on

329
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,650
really anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can talk over</font>

330
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:48,160
cereal I've seen some really cool midi

331
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:50,350
stuff that people have done which i'd

332
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,680
really like to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some projects</font>

333
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,680
going on

334
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:08,609
oh yeah so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it I'm really</font>

335
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,709
excited with the idea of interfacing

336
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:15,309
other electronics together and getting

337
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:18,160
something out of them at first when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

338
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,230
sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the drum he robot I</font>

339
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,910
took apart the controller and I was

340
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,199
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interfacing</font>

341
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,410
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller and try to figure</font>

342
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,030
out you know okay well when I hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

343
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,550
just one drum it's got to send whatever

344
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,800
the equivalent button press would be

345
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,379
over the controller port and I was way

346
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,149
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> overthinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and had when my buddies</font>

347
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,809
come over that not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> into computers</font>

348
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,730
not into electronics is just regular guy

349
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,620
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he said oh did you have any</font>

350
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:48,309
luck you know hooking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the actual</font>

351
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:52,209
drum to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensor if it's part of that</font>

352
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> geez that's awesome so um you</font>

353
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,570
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really helped in it it kind of</font>

354
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,580
really opened my mind that while if

355
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,379
there's a lot of ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tie</font>

356
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:03,059
into hardware I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

357
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:05,110
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into that that abstract level of</font>

358
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,110
interfacing with another devices

359
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,740
microcode or something like that for

360
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,709
example troops did a Wi-Fi detector that

361
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,000
interfaced with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino and so</font>

362
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically what it was it was one of</font>

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,050
those cheap little keychain wife ideally

364
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">stab it would have four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LEDs for the</font>

365
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,559
signal strength and then also had I

366
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,960
think a LED for if it was encrypted or

367
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,020
open and so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having to worry</font>

368
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,300
about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the the protocols and</font>

369
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,540
sniffing and all that he puts the

370
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arduino and tied it into the LEDs of the</font>

371
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,389
Wi-Fi so basically has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino with</font>

372
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:46,840
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of code saying okay listen</font>

373
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,660
for a high on this port and so when the

374
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,059
LED would come on it's changing a state

375
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,170
from low to high and so the

376
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,870
microcontroller is going to see that

377
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">change of state and so we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got say</font>

378
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:01,209
four pins for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> four signal strengths</font>

379
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:04,419
so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily send over to the</font>

380
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,610
Arduino<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no hay the Arduino is within</font>

381
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,170
four signal strength or three signal

382
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,110
strength I've been encrypted or

383
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,120
unencrypted and we've avoided having to

384
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,240
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the nitty-gritty of what is</font>

385
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,199
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware doing</font>

386
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,140
how exactly is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it working and started on</font>

387
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:24,260
to the LEDs so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ideal in</font>

388
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,660
solution but it's nice for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

389
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,030
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get in and I don't have to</font>

390
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,300
be a master necessarily of technology

391
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">but i can still an interesting product I</font>

392
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,309
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still do stuff that's neat and</font>

393
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:45,559
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just a blinky led it's</font>

394
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:47,629
a bunch LEDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright um another thing</font>

395
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,139
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Arduino that i like is it's</font>

396
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,780
open source which means that these

397
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,570
schematics<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code everything to make</font>

398
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,270
the Arduino is available online so you

399
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,399
can go to arduino CC which is the

400
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arduino home page and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

401
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,380
the schematics<font color="#CCCCCC"> to part list you can make</font>

402
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,780
this self your own you know that the one

403
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:12,020
I've god i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is around forty dollars</font>

404
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,629
or less and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could make it</font>

405
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself assuming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you had all the parts</font>

406
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,330
for you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 15 you know</font>

407
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,780
there's initial cost of having the

408
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,780
bootloader

409
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah microcontroller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IC</font>

410
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,120
chip right there that's your brain

411
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the atmel 168 chip and you can</font>

412
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,889
order this from digi-key mouths or any

413
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,080
kind of big house apart supplier and

414
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,120
it's round four dollars if you were

415
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,879
orders that way it comes blank it's not

416
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,699
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> arduino you have to load the</font>

417
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,870
bootloader onto it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some extra</font>

418
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,120
pins like that's the nice thing about

419
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,428
this development board as if i had a

420
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,309
bootloader which is it's a forty-dollar

421
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:06,520

00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,830
sorry yeah yeah very little sleep in a

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">homeless stuff mixed up but yeah it's</font>

425
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,139
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can program over there so I could</font>

426
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,700
pop out that programmed<font color="#CCCCCC"> IC put in a</font>

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">blank one that I got in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mail for</font>

428
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:27,809
four dollars from Ridgid key and then

429
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:30,730
the and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino IDE you got in the</font>

430
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:33,370
and the tools burn bootloader and

431
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,220
there's several different boot loaders

432
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,799
listed so I would hit that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot now</font>

433
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,020
my blank for dollar chip is now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

434
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,700
do we know compatible ready to go so if

435
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,158
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do multiple projects I</font>

436
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,580
wouldn't necessarily need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out and</font>

437
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,400
invest and multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> $40 development</font>

438
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,350
boards you could but you know at the

439
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,870
same time if you wanted to get in and

440
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,340
get a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> solder and you know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

441
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:01,570
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too and you make your own and</font>

442
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,668
it's encouraged a lot of the if you were

443
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,280
to make your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino you can't</font>

444
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:09,669
officially call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Arduino due to</font>

445
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,610
licensing so the term that's arisen is a

446
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:14,740
freed we know or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else along</font>

447
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,928
that I've seen one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was for</font>

448
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,730
controlling robotics those things but

449
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:20,980
basically you can call it a free do we

450
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,890
know if it's not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino and that's</font>

451
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">just it's an unofficial Arduino but they</font>

452
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,659
come in all kinds of different shapes

453
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:30,549
and forms for different different tasks

454
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,059
I don't know if you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of</font>

455
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:37,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reprap project that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NYC is doing</font>

456
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,010
but that's that's done with sanguis know

457
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,399
which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big brother of</font>

458
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,940
the

459
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:48,399
arduino chip instead of the atmel 168

460
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:50,679
it's using the atmel 6444 key which has

461
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:54,008
like four times the membrane<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys it's</font>

462
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,440
got double the digital output I think

463
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,749
it's got a couple extra analog inputs

464
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,389
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically got a lot more space</font>

465
00:22:58,749 --> 00:23:05,159
to work with so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reprap guys are used</font>

466
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:09,248
a niche this is another version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

467
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:12,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arduino you guys want to pass it around</font>

468
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:16,509
check it out it's called the lily pad

469
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:18,700
and what it is isn't as it comes around

470
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:21,460
you'll notice that it's it's it's got a

471
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,309
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of holes on the outside and that's</font>

472
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's designed for being sewn</font>

473
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:29,379
into clothing it's for kind of like

474
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,199
wearable electronics this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

475
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:35,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really excites me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the idea of</font>

476
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,979
having wearable electronics and stuff

477
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:42,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">just really gets me out here house on it</font>

478
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:45,999
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a conductive thread it</font>

479
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:50,469
works just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wire basically except</font>

480
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:51,820
it's red so I could take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the lily</font>

481
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:54,729
pad or do we know that's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

482
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,820
and I could take the thread so it took

483
00:23:54,729 --> 00:24:04,869
my shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then take like some surface</font>

484
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:07,269
mount LEDs and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leah Leo Buckley who</font>

485
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:09,158
play Buckley I'm terrible with names<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

486
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:13,389
she's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is designed that</font>

487
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:15,129
version of the lily pad there and what

488
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:18,609
she's done is she's taking surface mount

489
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:22,570
LEDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rule square LEDs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a</font>

490
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:24,099
like either brass or copper like little

491
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,359
beads and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then taking a little bit of</font>

492
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:29,889
solder and put it on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends of the</font>

493
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">surface mount LED and that way you've</font>

494
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:35,199
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to loop your thread through so</font>

495
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,969
she's new to you so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your different</font>

496
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,429
LEDs on to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> t-shirt she's done a</font>

497
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:40,839
whole lot of different projects one that

498
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought was really interesting and it</font>

499
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,639
hits that practical side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things is a</font>

500
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:48,009
Jedi jacket with on the back it had a

501
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:50,199
LEDs and turn signal kind of greater

502
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">than last and symbols and so that way</font>

503
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,130
when she was riding her bike she had

504
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,170
signals for she had a little buttons in

505
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,910
her sleep so she could let people know

506
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:00,340
where she was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going so it's kind of a</font>

507
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,380
fun practical way that you know for a

508
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,389
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars a little bit in time a</font>

509
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,040
little bit of conductive thread you've

510
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:10,390
got something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you really</font>

511
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:14,649
can't get anywhere else so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I don't</font>

512
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:18,210
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of kind of the possibility</font>

513
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:21,460
of making your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own embedded wearables</font>

514
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,590
really excites me especially the idea of

515
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,810
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and not looking like a cyborg</font>

516
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,970
or really standing out that that's

517
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:32,440
awesome one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects i'm</font>

518
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:34,960
currently working on um<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have no real</font>

519
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,610
awesome craft skills as far as the

520
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,310
embroidery and the needlework and all

521
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,780
that so I'm parently working on my my

522
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,610
hand work the needlework I've got a

523
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,980
sewing machine I'm in the process of

524
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,590
learning to use and I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk at</font>

525
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,660
närcon in April and Cleveland and the

526
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:52,419
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a little prototype a</font>

527
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:55,060
lightweight jacket by then with the the

528
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:58,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">lily pad embedded in it and my goal for</font>

529
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,870
the physical computing is to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

530
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,900
test run it's going to be to expand the

531
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,760
senses that we already have we're

532
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">surrounded by all kinds of stuff that</font>

533
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,650
our senses can't pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> up whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

534
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,900
infrared ultra waived because our eyes

535
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,560
only see so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the spectrum</font>

536
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,450
whether it's radio waves or you know I

537
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,970
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting how light waves as they</font>

538
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,730
propagate you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick them up with</font>

539
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:27,970
our eyes or with our ears or maybe with

540
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,220
UV burns you know our skin but yeah I'm

541
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,690
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> how can we pick up all</font>

542
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,020
this extra stuff that's floating around

543
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:38,800
and interface it in with our existing

544
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,900
senses so for example I'll bounce back

545
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,020
to the the Wi-Fi sensor that I talked

546
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,000
about earlier so like the Wi-Fi sensor

547
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,730
that droops may let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put it in</font>

548
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,490
the sleeve of our coat here and let's

549
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,530
put a small vibration motor like a from

550
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:56,590
a cell phone or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pager something like</font>

551
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:58,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as we're walking around and we</font>

552
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,510
hit a Wi-Fi area it can give us a little

553
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,580
buzzed let's say buzz-buzz well we got

554
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,280
two short pulses that means we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

555
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,980
range of oak

556
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,649
life I for walking around buzz buzz long

557
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,900
oh it's encrypted here let's keep

558
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,240
walking but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just walking down the</font>

559
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">road there's no external senses nobody</font>

560
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,700
but you is aware that hey all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

561
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,380
sudden I know that Wi-Fi is here you

562
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,940
know if you don't stop you don't move

563
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,950
you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just keep on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

564
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,110
it's an extra sense it's like walking

565
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,540
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road and picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up on an extra</font>

566
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:33,350
conversation so it's kind of the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

567
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:35,240
taking we've got a huge organ that

568
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,510
covers you know entire body of the skin

569
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,880
so to interface the tactile sense of

570
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,400
feeling with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking up</font>

571
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,670
wireless signal stuff like that the same

572
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:49,250
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless cameras is everywhere or</font>

573
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,870
not as bad as England or some places but

574
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,940
as some people may be really worried

575
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,770
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of Big Brother some</font>

576
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,320
people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know hey is</font>

577
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,120
somebody watching me you know not

578
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,960
because I'm doing something wrong or

579
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,060
something horrible thank you very much

580
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,650
but you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the you know the</font>

581
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,750
privacy factory and that's kind of nice

582
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:10,700
to know it some creepy dudes watching

583
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,390
what you're doing maybe I won't pick my

584
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,980
butt but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh so the idea is a lot of</font>

585
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,960
these night vision cameras and stuff

586
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,730
like that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using infrared to</font>

587
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,010
enhance the range or<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're viewing</font>

588
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,590
ability so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going along with the idea</font>

589
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:28,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coach say we put in infrared</font>

590
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:30,740
sensors say in north northeast east you

591
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:33,050
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight pin points all around the</font>

592
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,630
jacket so as we're walking down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> road</font>

593
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,570
saying we've got our camera up here as

594
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:42,140
I'm walking by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrared light is</font>

595
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,360
going to hang around to those sensors so

596
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,280
I would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have vibration motors</font>

597
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,169
hooked up to each one so as I walked by

598
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,710
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a buzz buzz buzz buzz</font>

599
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:54,140
buzz so I could turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go hey</font>

600
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,790
the cameras behind me the cameras in

601
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,250
front of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just based on the</font>

602
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:00,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">orientation of where the buzzes were</font>

603
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,780
coming from so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not standing out I'm</font>

604
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,940
not being creepy dude I'm not looking

605
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,790
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cameras but at the same time as</font>

606
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,500
I walk from my house to the grocery

607
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,659
store or you know to get a pack of

608
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,730
cigarettes and a soda and walk back to

609
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,830
the house hey I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not</font>

610
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">picking my butt while I walk</font>

611
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,220
that house because they've got a camera

612
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,159
wait till I get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

613
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:26,960
road and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to scratch away</font>

614
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,880
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we can interface</font>

615
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,820
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino there's a bunch of</font>

616
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,460
companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are making really cool</font>

617
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:38,210
little interface devices this is made by

618
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:42,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe grand grand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Studios a little rfid</font>

619
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:45,799
reader but um it's got four pins on it

620
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:48,139
one is voltage one is ground one is to

621
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,330
enable or turn on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reader and that's</font>

622
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:53,689
a ground pin as well and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

623
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,939
another one which is signal which which

624
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:59,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it you're going to swipe a</font>

625
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,760
tag you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know swipe a tag and it's going</font>

626
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send the information of that tag over</font>

627
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> serial to the Arduino so you know</font>

628
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,350
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of ways that you could</font>

629
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,950
interface you know this into different

630
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:16,039
programs stuff like that I said that's

631
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the cool thing it's using digital logic</font>

632
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:23,179
so it is either on or it's off if you've

633
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">got something that is kind of analog so</font>

634
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,620
to speak that's bouncing around in the

635
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">rings on the Arduino there's six analog</font>

636
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:36,110
ports the that male 168 has six

637
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,029
analog-to-digital converters built in so

638
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,059
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage of that in our</font>

639
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:46,669
projects when we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with stuff</font>

640
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:49,250
sorry which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very which is very handy</font>

641
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:52,659
so if we're missing with something

642
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:55,669
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more analog say like like a</font>

643
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:57,320
little bit voltaic sensor or something

644
00:30:55,669 --> 00:31:00,080
say maybe I've got a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> robot and</font>

645
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,480
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in having my robot when</font>

646
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,908
the battery power is below a certain

647
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,309
percentage level you know I'm losing so

648
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:09,080
many milliamps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you're going to</font>

649
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,730
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for where the brightest</font>

650
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,590
light spot is and then you're going to

651
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,470
park there until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> battery state</font>

652
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:17,870
changes to above this so when you're

653
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,330
looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that levels of sunlight</font>

654
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,709
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an analog reading so</font>

655
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,110
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that into</font>

656
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,170
the Arduino and then translate that into

657
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:30,600
a digital read

658
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:32,870
and so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of example code on</font>

659
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,870
there

660
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,039
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bummed because I</font>

661
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:47,020
don't have mine I had hardware problems

662
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,059
right now but does anybody have any

663
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:55,539
questions as anybody I've kind of been

664
00:31:49,059 --> 00:32:01,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">sporadic okay he's asking about the</font>

665
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:05,919
analog to digital converter it's a 1024

666
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:09,490
is the yeah yeah settle<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so and then</font>

667
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,860
you like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can yeah convert when</font>

668
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm reading for a potentiometer I'm</font>

669
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,820
sorry this is wearing black on my coat

670
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,140
part or whatever but the values come in

671
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,908
anywhere from 0 to 10 23 and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

672
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:30,480
Digital side i convert that from a

673
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:30,480
number between 0 and 255<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm an expert</font>

674
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:42,540
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the bang for the buck</font>

675
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,600
you really really it's kind of hard to

676
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:47,610
be it's there's a great community of

677
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff out there a lot of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

678
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:51,750
gotten going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and gotten work and I've</font>

679
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to piece together from a lot</font>

680
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,700
of just sample code our stuff that

681
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,310
people's already got going on out there

682
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:02,340
there's an IRC channel free no net pound

683
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:05,370
Arduino a lot of great guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there</font>

684
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,840
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all around the world so basically</font>

685
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today there's somebody in there</font>

686
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,220
to look around ask some questions

687
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,420
there's a couple really really

688
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,420
intelligent guys in there

689
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,210
anybody else curious about anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

690
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:31,830
that I was being pressed to do was to go

691
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and with the rock band little drum</font>

692
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:42,750
mod here was to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a MIDI</font>

693
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:45,899
out so with hydrogen you can the TT<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow</font>

694
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,960
what whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cereal coming in for</font>

695
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:53,220
hydrogen you can have a virtual serial

696
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:57,030
adapter that hydrogen can read like

697
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Statham but and then with so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can send</font>

698
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,770
information from like say whatever drum

699
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,679
was being hit so we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

700
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,600
represented as for the snare and one for

701
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,610
the base and the high hats or whatever

702
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,710
that the hydrogen would output so we

703
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,590
could have a b c d or one two three and

704
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,270
four so when one is hit it'll send one

705
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:18,090
over the sea report we could do it real

706
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:24,270
simple ones hey one so and then like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

707
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:27,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">said where we had oh yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we've</font>

708
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,399
got the sensitivity levels that would be

709
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,799
something that would apply at<font color="#E5E5E5"> hydrogen</font>

710
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,020
so if I'm you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> barely tapping</font>

711
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,890
the drums or really rocking it we could

712
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,889
have those levels show

713
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:56,639
yeah there's some there are some guys

714
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:58,230
have done that no no no there's some

715
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,030
guys that have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar with the</font>

716
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,819
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guitar they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a</font>

717
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,710
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was like a driven by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plc's</font>

718
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:06,270
but they had a camera that would watch

719
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,549
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they were what to say they</font>

720
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:10,710
were using processing but I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

721
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:12,390
totally wrong but yeah and basically it

722
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,750
was watching for the color changes on

723
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,740
the screen and sending out the output

724
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,839
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have thought</font>

725
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,959
as a different way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve the same</font>

726
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:23,279
thing and be a be a little hard to do as

727
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:26,579
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you couldn't just sit down and</font>

728
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,680
play any song but say for example you

729
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:32,460
went through and you can quote unquote

730
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,799
map out a song so Sam you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pick a</font>

731
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,069
particular song and a starting point but

732
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:40,710
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generate something on the on the</font>

733
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:43,529
drum here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm creating a beat at a time</font>

734
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:46,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could have a starting note to</font>

735
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:50,609
represent a value and then a timer going

736
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:54,990
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Arduino kind of</font>

737
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:57,150
act like the middleman to fool the ps3

738
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,459
into thinking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> add smack the drum</font>

739
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,710
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hadn't smack the drum so I could</font>

740
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,569
load up and whatever code and I could

741
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,420
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the guitar and then I have to</font>

742
00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit that first note on the drum to get</font>

743
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,200
it going after that it would keep with

744
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,750
the time cycle and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> still rock</font>

745
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,240
out so that was a different way we have

746
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,339
thought about doing as far as what's the

747
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,259
minimal amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware but you'd</font>

748
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:21,779
have more time because you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

749
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,210
encode each song so kind of the give and

750
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,589
take of well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a webcam and I</font>

751
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,770
don't want to miss with vision software

752
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:32,549
but I can you know figure out some

753
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:35,480
timing and red yellow blue green<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

754
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:35,480
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad code</font>

755
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:58,590
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low on time anybody else about</font>

756
00:36:41,070 --> 00:37:04,370
anything else I believe please don't

757
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:07,260
quote me on that but there is there uh

758
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:10,680
yeah the cool thing about the Arduino is

759
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:14,040
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> its its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pseudo see you can import</font>

760
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,399
libraries just like you can NC so if you

761
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,340
need a library to handle servos or

762
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,040
something else have a buddy of mine a

763
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:26,070
powder of 365 he wrote a program for

764
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,200
doing Morse code so basically he wanted

765
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,350
to be able to type in a string and then

766
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,720
have it generate that in Morse code and

767
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,730
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set variables as far as the</font>

768
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,830
words<font color="#E5E5E5"> per minute the tongue links and</font>

769
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,260
stuff like that how many times it

770
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,509
repeated basically for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> foxhunt so hope</font>

771
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,710
you guys are hams but basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

772
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the idea of what was going</font>

773
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">on but he had to write an actual Morse</font>

774
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:52,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">code library for his program to kind of</font>

775
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,670
minimize on some of the code there for

776
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:59,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino and the ethernet there are</font>

777
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:04,260
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a billion different they call</font>

778
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:06,750
them shields with the Arduino in that

779
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,030
the way it is there they sell like

780
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,830
Harlem shields and basically it's a

781
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:14,520
module with a bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors</font>

782
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:16,529
an example the Ethernet shield has an

783
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,840
Ethernet port and it has a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pins</font>

784
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,850
that line up with those pins and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

785
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,920
basically just seat it down on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of it</font>

786
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,170
and so you could get a big stack of

787
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,750
different stuff going on assuming that

788
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can access through all the pins and</font>

789
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:34,460
have open hands going but the the

790
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,500
Ethernet shield is really neat and I

791
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,300
haven't messed with it but from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

792
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my buddies that I have talked to it's</font>

793
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,980
apparently really easy to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some neat</font>

794
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:46,500
stuff going<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using pH</font>

795
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,500
p and doing stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

796
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:51,150
some really interesting stuff something

797
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,020
that I'm interested in missing with is I

798
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:56,490
kind of got addicted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter so one</font>

799
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,400
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be really fun</font>

800
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,700
with to be a you know Twitter up to the

801
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,290
Arduino you know give me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a just a</font>

802
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,850
different visual interface that's that's

803
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,680
one thing that I'm interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font>

804
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:09,359
there's so much information that's

805
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,500
coming in electronic or in different

806
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,730
formats and I really you know it's

807
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:17,940
interrupts with the workflow you're

808
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:20,280
either falling behind because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

809
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,740
up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information or it's popping</font>

810
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,720
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's interrupting your workflow as i</font>

811
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,580
get older and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more serious</font>

812
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,980
about project you know really understand

813
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,130
how important time<font color="#CCCCCC"> management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font>

814
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,869
setting critical goals and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

815
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,760
important so to have that workflow

816
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:37,020
interrupted and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of</font>

817
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,190
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working on some of these</font>

818
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects thank you know it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font>

819
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:42,690
cool to have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a subtle influence</font>

820
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:44,700
that wouldn't interrupt my workflow so

821
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,859
like with Twitter instead of the message

822
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,750
popping up to where oh I can read it and

823
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,040
interrupt my workflow you know why not

824
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:52,590
hook it up with the Arduino to have a

825
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,890
couple LEDs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have three different</font>

826
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:58,380
colors<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for a regular message</font>

827
00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:01,410
reply or direct message and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

828
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a stack of LED so I have you no</font>

829
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:06,029
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or four messages</font>

830
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:07,879
multiple LED start coming on so kind of

831
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,070
over at a glance I can see I've got

832
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,210
tweets awaiting me you know wow I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

833
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,700
a whole bunch just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at all those</font>

834
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">LEDs one of that kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glance at a</font>

835
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:21,089
thing or I was really intrigued by it

836
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,500
was the orb device under he guys had

837
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,840
seen it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was just a</font>

838
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,020
frosted piece of glass with a bunch of

839
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,210
LEDs on it and you hooked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up through</font>

840
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,310
USB and if it would change<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

841
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,440
colors based on different notifications

842
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:36,810
so if you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a email or something it</font>

843
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,400
would pull screen and if you had this or

844
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,660
that and it would pull us back and forth

845
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,900
to different colors to give you the

846
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,490
different notifications and I really

847
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,690
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that idea I like the idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

848
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,850
something that

849
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,570
it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of applying that</font>

850
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:53,460
Pavlov's dog syndrome to us so that

851
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,980
training that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Blue means this and</font>

852
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,540
red means this and you know but you kind

853
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,490
of train yourself I like the idea of

854
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,220
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an orb or</font>

855
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,930
you know something like that that have a

856
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,910
different couple color patterns or

857
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,680
something that I can glance that when i

858
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">get up in the morning or still be half</font>

859
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,899
asleep and based on the color pattern or

860
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,509
arrangement of colors grasp a large

861
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,580
amount of information from it going it's

862
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,490
going to rain today I've got 5 tweets

863
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:22,020
and you know dis in that nests and I'm

864
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,970
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go pee and I'm going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

865
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,880
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bed you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz none of that's that</font>

866
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:29,490
important or maybe it is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

867
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,620
I you know should do other stuff but

868
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:33,569
that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know sudden main goal</font>

869
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,190
of this top other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully not to</font>

870
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,470
confuse you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to really just</font>

871
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,000
kind of get you excited and about the

872
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">arduino stuff if you're not already</font>

873
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,690
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know what it is it's</font>

874
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,670
starting to get a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

875
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:48,630
mainstream more more people when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say</font>

876
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:52,950
they are doing ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay instead that's</font>

877
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">awesome and yet it's really not I can do</font>

878
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,720
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do it anybody can do it</font>

879
00:41:55,350 --> 00:42:04,020
like yeah we can train my dog to do it

880
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,970
awesome um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have thumbs right on</font>

881
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:07,470
but yeah so I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that's a lot</font>

882
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they cuz I'm when I was</font>

883
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:10,919
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the like the Wi-Fi sensor</font>

884
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,120
to somebody else you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they started</font>

885
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,890
well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you gonna do the protocol</font>

886
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,600
and how you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just hook up to</font>

887
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,730
the LED<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so there's different</font>

888
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,980
levels of complexity so you don't have

889
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:22,830
to be master ninja you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of have</font>

890
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,270
to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where's where does</font>

891
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,910
the Vice that I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack into</font>

892
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:29,220
where's this output port so I mean you

893
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,950
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that has a status light on</font>

894
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,810
it you know your coffee maker<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can</font>

895
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:37,109
hook up the Arduino with a little

896
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless serial module for about five</font>

897
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:41,190
dollars there's wireless eat cereal

898
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,040
module I get a range of around 500 feet

899
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:45,450
in open area so you got walls and stuff

900
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,730
you're going to decrease that let's say

901
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:51,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">for your house</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a wireless module</font>

902
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,260
hooked up to the coffee maker so I get

903
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,540
in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when I get up in the</font>

904
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,220
morning I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> press the button to start</font>

905
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,560
my coffee while I'm sitting at my

906
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,089
computer eating when your coffee's done

907
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,400
you know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a little LED that</font>

908
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,260
comes on the Arduino can be listening

909
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,510
for that low to high that change your

910
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">state when that light comes on it could</font>

911
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,160
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message because that state has</font>

912
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,300
changed and light up your LED back in

913
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,660
your room or sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

914
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer thing coffee's done awesome so</font>

915
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's the kind of thing I like</font>

916
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,750
it's just there's all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> le</font>

917
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,640
everything's got blinky lights now you

918
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,040
know they're blue the red they're green

919
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,200
they're awesome and that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

920
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,120
it's that's an interface port you know

921
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to don't have to know</font>

922
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:36,509
assembly you don't have to be a you know

923
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:39,150
all this abstracted people get really

924
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:41,760
gonna you know oh I don't know where to

925
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,800
start I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how to you know so</font>

926
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,610
breaking it down to that smaller level

927
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,370
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well find some LEDs start tying</font>

928
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:53,060
into those learn about other different

929
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:55,890
small sensors and how they operate and

930
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,840
really it's it's a very snowball kind of

931
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,549
process it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

932
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,830
start depending on what you start on

933
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,420
something it all just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compounds</font>

934
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,330
on to something else than something else

935
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:10,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you know it near you've got a</font>

936
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:13,049
room full of really weird looking stuff

937
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:17,819
yeah it's a good thing to not leave that

938
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:20,370
out when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folk come over but</font>

939
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:24,780
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> um any other questions I'll wrap it</font>

940
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:27,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">up to save for time awesome thanks for</font>

941
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,530
the seminian ramble
