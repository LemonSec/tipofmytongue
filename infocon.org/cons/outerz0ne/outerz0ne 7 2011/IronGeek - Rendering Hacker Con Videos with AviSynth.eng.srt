Crenshaw and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation I'm going</font>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,780
to be giving today is on recording hecka

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,509
cons and how do picture in the picture

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,570
on the cheap first of all a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:19,590
about me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> bernanke com hope some of</font>

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,869
y'all been at some point that i need the

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,560
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have an interest in infosec</font>

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,769
education I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I was</font>

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,689
a geek of time on my hands especially

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,948
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes to video there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,390
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll probably slightly wrong</font>

13
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,219
something's big in the video editing

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,370
will say well now you miss use the term

15
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,399
filter or you're confusing Direct X or

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry directshow with video for windows</font>

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,670
or some little intricacy like that so I

18
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,069
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details wrong</font>

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,660
but hopefully this pop give you just

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,129
enough information to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos</font>

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,739
similar to the ones i've been doing from

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,019
my website i'm also an irregular on the

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISDN podcast every first midnight</font>

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,350
generally speaking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also on special</font>

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,979
occasions we had a podcast last night

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,229
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recorded in the party room ok so</font>

27
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,289
the core topic for this presentation is

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,729
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm actually</font>

29
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:20,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go grab some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my equipment I</font>

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:22,170
have and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that comment I want</font>

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">those guys it probably doesn't even need</font>

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,939
the microphone but it helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

33
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,939
recording

34
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,470
now I do various some videos go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hepa</font>

35
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,350
cons also recorded classes that we do

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,610
with local Issa and I end up trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

37
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,039
make something that looks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

38
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,340
like this where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the speaker in</font>

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,310
one corner because the slides in another

40
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,270
and the main body and I really like

41
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,250
doing it this way because how many

42
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have seen like quoted videos of</font>

43
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,700
presentations and you had no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

44
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,800
the hell was in the slides because it

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,210
was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> way too blurry and I know</font>

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,970
another guy who does goes around the

47
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,559
cons and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cords it and he once told me</font>

48
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he gets better image results by</font>

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,520
putting a camera on the screen and I did

50
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,260
not with a crap i had maybe maybe we

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,300
have some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad capture devices and</font>

52
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,399
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad vga to svideo adapters</font>

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,440
that might be the case but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna</font>

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,390
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how i produce videos that look</font>

55
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,100
something like that and we're also gonna

56
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,839
do a partially live demo of me when

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,109
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully the video that was just</font>

58
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">recorded by skydog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright first of all</font>

59
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:31,459
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit what hardware are used and</font>

60
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,489
skydog users we have slightly different

61
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,170
rigs for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference pretty much all</font>

62
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:39,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video equipment except for one</font>

63
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,880
converter is all skydog stuff and he

64
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,980
hasn't set up to where it's a science

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,180
you just screw it down and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get up</font>

66
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> running one of the biggest issues</font>

67
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,780
putting all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff to give it a</font>

68
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,459
conference or class is<font color="#CCCCCC"> two tons and tons</font>

69
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of crap why did you end up getting</font>

70
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,540
braided together before the end and so

71
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,160
it ends up taking a while to set up the

72
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,200
cool things you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> record videos</font>

73
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,220
the way we've been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them is the</font>

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,290
worst way I've been doing I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

75
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,720
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i do my captures straight</font>

76
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,900
to a laptop as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide to</font>

77
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,489
concern using a captured dong<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll you</font>

78
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:12,799
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need a video camera and</font>

79
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,850
let's fight in fact these two this

80
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,110
bullet point<font color="#E5E5E5"> county got combined</font>

81
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,390
together you also need a USB video

82
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,430
capture device now the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> i usually use</font>

83
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is about twenty dollars from dealextreme</font>

84
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:26,150
and it does a decent job what can I say

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,160
you also need a vga to svideo converter

86
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,860
now my current one you can see later on

87
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,380
is hooked up there it looks a little

88
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,780
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that does</font>

89
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,350
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a VGA signal in and throws</font>

90
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,460
out s-video why because s<font color="#E5E5E5"> video capture</font>

91
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,170
devices are a lot cheaper than

92
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,550
straight up vga capture devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

93
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,980
some the cheaper ones I saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> first-rate</font>

94
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,430
up vga capture like three four hundred

95
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,530
bucks this adapters<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks and it</font>

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,430
still gives decent results just not ask

97
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,320
crisp as you can get but I use this to

98
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,390
convert to s-video and this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

99
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,709
is about 30 bucks then I throw it into a

100
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,260
capture dongle which is costing<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

101
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,030
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 bucks and into a laptop now</font>

102
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,519
the way skydog does it is a little bit

103
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,960
different and he's got a refined to

104
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,120
where he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> froze on this box this box</font>

105
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,870
has a bunch of law be mates in it and

106
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,050
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> V mates can take a composite in</font>

107
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,200
and we quote to an SD<font color="#CCCCCC"> card and then you</font>

108
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">get some mp4s off that you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mess</font>

109
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,659
around with and it does simplify things

110
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,250
a whole lot the problem is composite you

111
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,740
don't quite as good at image quality as

112
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:33,750
you do with s-video so s video<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big</font>

113
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,000
drop from<font color="#E5E5E5"> VGA and composite somewhat of</font>

114
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,380
a drop from s-video however it does make

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,420
things a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more convenient</font>

116
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,490
having a laptop out there and it's so

117
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,230
much a laptop capture software that is

118
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,640
buggy as hell I find this out in video

119
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">up video in general it's like finding a</font>

120
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,750
video get halfway a foot away through it

121
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,280
and it crashed xiangya you have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

122
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,910
why doesn't give you any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of real</font>

123
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,820
useful information so the estimates are

124
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,410
the be mates are a big help for that as

125
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,450
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recording</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the video the</font>

126
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,970
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is just a fairly crappy</font>

127
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,340
aiptek that doesn't do really good

128
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,410
low-light a few tips<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have for you</font>

129
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,169
if you ever decide to record days a lot

130
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,640
of mine I don't Mike the speaker it's

131
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,070
really nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike the speaker to get</font>

132
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,229
rid of ambient sound and get better

133
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,670
audio quality and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is a lot</font>

134
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,220
of my chief of cameras he's got a better

135
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,500
camera as far as a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality is</font>

136
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,360
concerned probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> with low light but</font>

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,090
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those if you can get a light on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the speaker it helped immensely but</font>

the password class were Alex and Martin

of you barely visible because of how

142

a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vmail setups now my</font>

144
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,770
course setup is essentially I have a

145
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,550
camera this<font color="#E5E5E5"> recording separate to sit</font>

146
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:49,680
there stand alone and then i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

147
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,220
presenters laptop hooked up to that vga

148
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,560
to svideo adapter then the SVO adapter

149
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,680
is running into my

150
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,470
USB capture device and then that's going

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
to my capture laptop as captured him

152
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,480
there and afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> combine together</font>

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">sky dogs wig looks awesome and more like</font>

154
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,120
this sep four it's a little more company

155
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,410
this because he has multiple be<font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,930
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he has the camera</font>

157
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,610
feeding into a V mate he has the

158
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,340
presenters laptop running into a V mate

159
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:19,460
and he also has another side camera

160
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,440
running into be mate so he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you</font>

161
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a little crossing back and forth he</font>

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:34,370
has a fourth one also we mixed that

163
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:36,280
video in that video so yeah he's his rig

164
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,110
and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot fancier than mine</font>

165
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:48,799
so that's since the hard way we have set

166
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">up yes oh yes um yeah on both of our</font>

167
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:57,169
rigs is VJ to a composite objs video

168
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,510
usually it has a way of the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">vga mirror out of it that you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

170
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,729
hook off to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> projector so somewhere</font>

171
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,099
over here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have to vga ports</font>

172
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,960
once in one's out and you're capturing

173
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,780
up the s-video out and the projectors

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,039
hooked up to the vga out anybody wants

175
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,080
to see this later on just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

176
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,950
carefully look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sky dogs rig and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

177
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,840
have some of my equipment here as well

178
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:22,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now he's using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be mates for</font>

179
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,460
capturing which does simplify things a

180
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:28,719
lot i usually use a Windows Media

181
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,190
encoder to do my captures why because it

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,860
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crash less than anything else</font>

183
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've tried as far as with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liability it</font>

184
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,600
means i'm getting WMV files out when i

185
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,169
record but they work just fine it's

186
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,240
fairly crisp and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

187
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:48,440
all my settings correct I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually do 25</font>

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,180
frames a second it's a my camera does

189
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,969
like 60 frames a second which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

190
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,560
actually 59 points something which I

191
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,389
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need that many frames a</font>

192
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
second and the mainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> sighs convert 18</font>

193
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:00,530
to 25 frames a second is it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

194
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,060
for me to do the math since if I don't

195
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,429
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lay something four seconds or</font>

196
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,150
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> four seconds I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it my hat</font>

197
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,350
and head real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

198
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:12,090
hundred frames nice and simple and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

199
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,860
have good luck with Windows Media

200
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,570
encoder I would provide a download link

201
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,450
unfortunately they seem to replace it

202
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">with expressions encoder which so far</font>

203
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,780
what I plate of it I don't like nearly

204
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well maybe it just takes a little bit</font>

205
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,979
more getting used to if you google

206
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,320
around for it look around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the 64 bit</font>

207
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of Windows Media encoder and if</font>

208
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,950
you can't find any place email me and

209
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,080
i'll see if i can find you a copy i

210
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,789
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can host it my website</font>

211
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,290
since it is microsoft stuff but since it

212
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,059
was released as freeware I've actually

213
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,449
distribution in between people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

214
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,069
no issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright another tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use for</font>

215
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of my video depending on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

216
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,730
end up getting the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> from sometimes</font>

217
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,410
it's not workable like sometimes I'll go

218
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,990
to a con and I won't want to pack all my

219
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,490
stuff to get on the plane so I'll use

220
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,440
someone else's camera there but the

221
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,850
video they throw out I mean I have all

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,620
the right filters on my laptop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> begin</font>

223
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what to do with it so I</font>

224
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,790
might throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into a Vig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mux and throw</font>

225
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,370
it into a different video format that I

226
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,719
can work with and a Vig months is

227
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,870
awesome for that it's got various

228
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:14,550
filters for resizing cleaning up images

229
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,170
scrap things are subtitling though

230
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,640
generally speaking if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if I</font>

231
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">can fill the wrong video into some</font>

232
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,069
description will show you here in a bit

233
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,569
I do that because it streamlines fangs

234
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,640
if I have to take the video from the

235
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,400
camera convert it into an avi of a

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,170
special format copy out the audio can

237
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,640
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WAV file then</font>

238
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">float all to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my script that's several</font>

239
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,550
extra steps computation why's it may be

240
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,950
the same but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can eliminate as many</font>

241
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,270
steps to human involved as I can it just

242
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,620
makes you know the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rendering</font>

243
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,680
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos a lot easier and</font>

244
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">luckily I've found some filters recently</font>

245
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,949
that's going to streamline<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process</font>

246
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,280
of putting these videos hopefully from

247
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,630
today into a finished product in

248
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,670
previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had to copy</font>

249
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,770
the audio back out and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into my</font>

250
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,689
videos because<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason avi sent</font>

251
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,750
was failing on it and I found the right

252
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,000
plugins now to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work Oh</font>

253
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,050
virtualdub is another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,230
sometimes I'm gonna go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and slide</font>

255
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,660
atid<font color="#CCCCCC"> mugs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while there I would try</font>

256
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,980
to my rendering in a PID<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux for the</font>

257
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,040
final product i'll be putting up from

258
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,810
the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make mp4s</font>

259
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,000
unfortunately it does directly work with

260
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bi of sense scripts which i'll be</font>

261
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,320
showing here in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit those like a simp</font>

262
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,930
server you can throw in there I had

263
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,430
mixed luck with that and there's

264
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,489
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tool where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can take an</font>

265
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,989
API<font color="#CCCCCC"> since crib and mount it as a part of</font>

266
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,899
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> filesystem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically it shows</font>

267
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:42,319
this huge uncompressed avi and a virtual

268
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,329
directory but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I folded into a</font>

269
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vig mugs and everything would be upside</font>

270
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:48,949
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and backwards now you can feel a</font>

271
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,758
filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that that will automatically</font>

272
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:55,939
flip it but it's an extra step now a

273
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:58,310
virtual dub<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll be a VI send scripts</font>

274
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,620
directly your outputs a little bit more

275
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,388
limited I'm saving<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a vis and I'm</font>

276
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:09,139
going put a generic usually speaking i'm

277
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:12,410
using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight-up xvid and mp3 just or</font>

278
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:14,360
lame as an encoded just because

279
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,219
everybody seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support it the videos</font>

280
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,860
may not be as small as they could

281
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,410
possibly be but they said super

282
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,269
supported and virtual dub also has a ton

283
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,529
of different filter sorry yeah

284
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:26,600
virtualdub also has a ton of different

285
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:29,839
filters you can fly as far as resizing

286
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,579
and messing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the image another</font>

287
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
oil i use from time to time especially

288
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:34,910
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've had problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with doing the</font>

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,240
video of the work but not the audio is

290
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,850
ida install audacity copy the video into

291
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,010
audacity get just the audio then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,810
mess around the audio clean up noise in

293
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,939
it because uh audacity has a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise</font>

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">removal feature or just turn the video</font>

296
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,630
that I can throw into an avi scream

297
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,139
script to make work luckily I think I

298
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,389
got enough things and abs of cinch now

299
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:00,319
to uh not even have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this step but</font>

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,149
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you need to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

301
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,740
because if you want to clean up sound

302
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,329
like you had a really noisy auditorium

303
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:06,410
or you know your microphones right next

304
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:08,899
to an air conditioner so you have that

305

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,449
compositing and its really really nifty

311
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,979
essentially you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the script and</font>

312
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:30,649
you can tell it what to do with videos

313
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,790
and give you the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> results and I'll</font>

what you do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-click on the</font>

there's also extra filters you can add

streamlines the hell out of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what kind of video transfer</font>

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,060
into it you can have to have the right

346
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,240
codec on your machine generally speaking

347
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:45,079
you need ffdshow to do impact for stuff

348
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,870
right along with xvid i usually do much

349
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,450
my encoding in xvid just because it's a

350
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:53,210
little faster if I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> my druthers I</font>

351
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:56,690
would try to do a ex I was x 264

352
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,760
encoding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do to pass to get the best</font>

353
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:01,070
small best quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the smaller size</font>

354
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,270
but takes a really long time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

355
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,410
understand the process corrected what

356
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,180
the code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in the background we</font>

357
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,420
use x264 which is like an open source

358
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,099
version of h.264 it looks at the first

359
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,930
time and the first pass and figures at

360
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,330
work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimize then the second pass</font>

361
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,530
it makes the smaller size possible the

362
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,470
way a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are compression</font>

363
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,030
codecs work is it looks for changes for

364
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance if you have nothing but a black</font>

365
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,260
background and you try to compress that

366
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,640
you can press that down super small

367
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,890
because very few changes to member

368
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,319
basically the codec has to memorize oh

369
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay black flame black frame black frame</font>

370
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,530
all this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can they can shrink that</font>

371
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,030
down very small now you have a lot of

372
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">different colors a lot of changes it</font>

373
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:40,850
takes more space<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that to pass</font>

374
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,350
encoding it can figure out where it can

375
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,570
optimize the video you get the small

376
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,070
size however it takes a lot longer

377
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,740
if you want to be able to try messing

378
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,120
around with x 264 encoding the video for

<font color="#CCCCCC">windows version of the codec you can use</font>

filters and plugins and then find out it

were taking over my video my video

411
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:11,180
process and was screwing up and slowing

412
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:11,959
down the my final windows so turns you

413
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,939
have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there and figure out</font>

414
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,880
what's screwing things up and there's a

415
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,649
tool called a DSF manager which allows

416
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,020
you to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video filters are</font>

417
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,790
installed and add and remove them which

418
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice with fixing things my</font>

419
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,779
general recommendation is don't install

420
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,540
codec packs install the individual

421
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,670
codecs you think you need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> codec</font>

422
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:34,279
packs may solve some problems but they

423
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,810
can also cause even more there's no to I

424
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,040
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on listed on here but I</font>

425
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,869
believe it's called oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

426
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,110
think of what it's called there's a tool

427
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,790
basically it's for visually showing you

428
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,740
what filters click it's called a graph

429
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,480
edit that will show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what filters are</font>

430
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,430
applied whenever you open up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and</font>

431
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,029
its really nice to figure out what might

432
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,979
be screwing things up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process</font>

433
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit a live</font>

434
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,170
demo to

435
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:04,600
show how we go to win to these videos so

436
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:06,659
let me exit add this and actually will

437
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:13,929
show you a couple those tools real quick

438
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned this one see that DSF</font>

439
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,250
manager does you see what all filters

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,089
you have installed so you can add and

441
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">remove them which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is offering nifty and</font>

442
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,959
some place in here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had graph edit</font>

443
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,270
those code versions of this one has an

444
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,030
open source version this is graphs to do

445
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:35,080
Microsoft's I think s<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's</font>

446
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:37,720
directx sdk also has a version but let's

447
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,669
say I was to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some video file in</font>

448
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,970
this it would show me what's actually

449
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,870
using to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it all winded and if I</font>

450
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,700
let's say I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have one laptop</font>

451
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,979
that's rendering right and when it's not

452
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can use this as a diagnostic tool to</font>

453
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,890
figure out what particular little codec

454
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:55,600
i have installed it might be screwing

455
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:57,940
the pooch but let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

456
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,740
actually do some live rendering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

457
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,970
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bold and see if I can get</font>

458
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,670
this to work I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over with my</font>

459
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:06,300
cup more complex scripts and i'm gonna

460
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,800
copy a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> different files into</font>

461
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:13,899
directory one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where i should</font>

462
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,899
have the videos from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sky dogs earlier</font>

463
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:21,720
talk let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if I got everything I</font>

464
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:25,350
need there oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want that one I</font>

465
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,350
want this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

466
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,120
and hungry bold and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

467
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,550
this and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens then we'll</font>

468
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,399
explain how it's actually working Chris

469
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,520
few seconds you say I have an overlay of

470
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:51,540
the various sponsors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friends of the</font>

471
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,790
conference that's not bending at exactly

472
00:18:51,540 --> 00:19:01,530
real time here but you see I have my

473
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:05,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">corner text I have slides and of course</font>

474
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:08,129
I have the speaker now let's go see how

475
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,930
I actually end up doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that avi</font>

476
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,680
sent is a scripting language so let's

477
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:16,500
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bad boy up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually I will</font>

478
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,970
do one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a little thing is that just</font>

479
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,440
the intro video<font color="#CCCCCC"> game yo is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

480
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,440
intro and sky dogs talk

481
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:38,600
so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> his okay okay so the</font>

482
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:44,990
reason I ask is simplify things i did

483
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:46,760
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can copy and paste i'll show</font>

484
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,320
you why i'm doing this in a second let

485
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,940
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> close everything down so listen</font>

486
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,408
confuse by everybody's wondering i'm

487
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,899
using notepad plus plus for all my

488
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:57,080
editing I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls windows text</font>

489
00:19:53,899 --> 00:19:59,658
editors it's nice convenient okay here's

490
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,769
an avi<font color="#E5E5E5"> since script of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> premiere</font>

491
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,179
of most scripting language allows

492
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,610
scripting languages<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use the pound</font>

493
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:05,990
symbol as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll give</font>

494
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,939
some explanation in these scripts and if

495
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,679
I want some<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I have versions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

496
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,990
out of my website but the also one of my

497
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,570
can give you one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll probably go ahead</font>

498
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them off of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video page</font>

499
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,029
whenever I post the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outer zone videos</font>

500
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:21,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">now in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case the first thing I'm</font>

501
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:22,700
doing is I'm getting a live audio for

502
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,190
whatever reason the videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

503
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,799
coming out of these um this isn't always

504
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,510
necessary but in this case it is the

505
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:32,000
video coming up these<font color="#E5E5E5"> V mates the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audios</font>

506
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,769
somehow weird so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to use a special</font>

507
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,510
plugin i mentioned before the be happy

508
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,460
one and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can add that but basically</font>

509
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,500
going out to the avi sent folder on your

510
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,659
machine and copying the plug in the

511
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,250
plugins folder like a lot of other tools

512
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:45,590
it's basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way to install</font>

513
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">plugins and what it allows me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

514
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:51,590
grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audio directly from that mp4</font>

515
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:55,429
live mp4 then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make another object</font>

516
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,110
called live vid and I grab the video now

517
00:20:55,429 --> 00:21:00,380
it's all its parameters<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'll link</font>

518
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,959
off to in a bit directions from a wiki

519
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:06,529
on all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different internal functions</font>

520
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,649
and external functions you can add but i

521
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:13,760
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct show I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grab the mp4 file i</font>

522
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:15,439
telt use 25 frames a second and convert

523
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,769
to 25 frames a second if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it isn't</font>

524
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,769
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could put the color</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space to</font>

525
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,940
24 bit RGB just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't be fun</font>

526
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,830
other stuff that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just need a</font>

527
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,269
common way because my<font color="#CCCCCC"> stock compositing</font>

528
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,449
videos are using different color spaces

529
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:30,559
it ain't happy i dub in that live audio

530
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,330
from before and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do that before</font>

531
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,799
everything else and you see how it's

532
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,320
kind of got an object oriented

533
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:38,269
architecture to it where you say dot do

534
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,700
this to it dot do that to it and so

535
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:41,480
forth so from left to right these are

536
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,260
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order</font>

537
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,059
so i dub in the audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm probably don't</font>

538
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,549
need this extra convert to 25 / saying

539
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:54,350
it's a second by have it there anyway

540
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:56,840
now this trim is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i generally</font>

541
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,240
only mess with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first parameter this</font>

542
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">0 what this trim does is tell me that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

543
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,559
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fsm script how many frames</font>

544
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,179
to take off of it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sometimes</font>

545
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,710
these are from your recording video

546
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,630
you're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the slide</font>

547
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,760
capture the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you're capturing</font>

548
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,679
the live person so it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few seconds</font>

549
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,600
off so you guys sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and time it</font>

550
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,460
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was saying when the earlier</font>

551
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:20,090
talks it's nice if you have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

552
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:22,820
of the screen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the live part of the</font>

553
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,010
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can sync it all up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

554
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,918
between this trim and the trim where I

555
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,780
import the slides I can adjust it and

556
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,440
take off just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of frames</font>

557
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,970
to make a match up pretty much perfectly

558
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,280
then to make anything smaller the video

559
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:42,230
coming off these I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's like 720 x</font>

560
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:44,750
480<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it look cozy and</font>

561
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,360
resize and that's just one that gives me

562
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:51,169
better quality when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing shrinking</font>

563
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,659
I think bilinear would be faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than if</font>

564
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:55,340
I remember which ones which but it

565
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,549
doesn't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you quite as crisp equality</font>

566
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,168
and in here most of my bottle neck seems

567
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:03,049
to be the actual turning it into an xvid

568
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,490
not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> the avi script script so</font>

569
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:09,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">I will go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and just really cozy and</font>

570
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:10,790
resize then once i have that live video

571
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,280
and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want it i create another</font>

572
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,530
object for the slides and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

573
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,799
the slides mp4 and of course most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

574
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,299
same settings 25 frames a second convert

575
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,400
to mono why I'm doing that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides</font>

576
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,929
here I really don't know since I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

577
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,460
getting my audio from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides that's</font>

578
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,240
probably something I had left over from

579
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:37,549
a previous script because promote the

580
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:42,799
RPG RGB<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 bit and there after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> due to</font>

581
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:47,290
resize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 640 by 480 and 25 frames a</font>

582
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,290
second and of course trim if I need to

583
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,860
then thereafter I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab the corner</font>

584
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:56,929
and for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use an image source and I</font>

585
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,178
have a PNG file now the way I've been

586
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:03,080
doing these P&G files I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

587
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> code here that's probably not</font>

588
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,049
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I don't want you to be</font>

589
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">sighs it since i already have it the</font>

590
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,210
right size I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

591
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things work I kind of have a cargo cult</font>

592
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,970
programming mentality when it comes to

593
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,920
this throwing stuff in I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

594
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily need but I might use in</font>

595
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,360
future scripts and another function I

596
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,370
have in here is the subtitle function

597
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,229
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be using for putting</font>

598
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:30,949
the person's a title in there so I can

599
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">just say skydog mande hacker and I may</font>

600
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,790
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back into adjust that to get</font>

601
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:40,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lines but we'll see</font>

602
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">how that actually turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out actually</font>

603
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,580
instead I'm gonna put a new line

604
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,360
character now and that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

605
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:49,549
as C++ and I setting set the halo color

606
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,540
select how it glows and the main text

607
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:57,980
color but i'ma show you what I've been

608
00:24:53,540 --> 00:25:02,030
doing for images back out here right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

609
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,679
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PNG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> file and for both the intro</font>

610
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:06,740
part that lasts for a few seconds and

611
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the corner the way I generate those is</font>

612
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:15,470
i've been using a tool called paint.net

613
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:17,240
and the thing I like about it is it's

614
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,470
well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know I haven't use</font>

615
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,299
Photoshop enough to really be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

616
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:21,850
compare but it does everything i need to

617
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">do as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far as multiple layers</font>

618
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,320
transparencies and all that like almost

619
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,970
open up that intro you know notice how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

620
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there's a slight alpha channel</font>

621
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,600
to that you may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to make it out on</font>

622
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,139
the projector but you can slightly see

623
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,290
through the title and you see I set up

624
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,880
transparent semi sorry alpha channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> duh</font>

625
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,520
translucent dark color behind

626
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,620
everybody's logo that way it shows up

627
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,080
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on top of the slides but</font>

628
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,760
you can still see behind it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

629
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,100
really nice with setting all that up the

630
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,080
alpha channel goes through its really

631
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,600
nifty<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have multiple layers so i can</font>

632
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,799
replace a title<font color="#CCCCCC"> in if i want just makes</font>

633
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,449
things nice and easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with from</font>

634
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:04,309
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an avi since i just save it</font>

635
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:06,830
as a PNG file but that's all those

636
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:07,830
constructed together now let's go back

637
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">and let's look at the</font>

638
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,439
the script before we start actually

639
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:17,100
rendering it with avi set aside a

640
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:20,130
virtual dub<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I do is I</font>

641
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,980
start adding videos together so this

642
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,840
corner plot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus corner i stacked</font>

643
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:31,289
vertically the live video in the corner

644
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:36,240
put them together then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there after i put</font>

645
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:45,419
the intro video<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sorry let me see what</font>

646
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:48,809
i got here i overlay the intro image and

647
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:50,899
get that that's an object don't actually

648
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:57,480
put any place yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just grabbed it and</font>

649
00:26:50,899 --> 00:27:00,809
that's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> horizontal the live plus</font>

650
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,340
corner plus the slides then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I dub back</font>

651
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,190
on the live audio video because

652
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,709
depending on which ones you stack first

653
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,690
it chooses<font color="#CCCCCC"> which audio to use to make</font>

654
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,730
sure i'm using the live videos audio<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

655
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,639
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little step and then</font>

656
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,860
finally does insert sign now if i wanted

657
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:19,168
to i could take out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part and we</font>

658
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,010
move everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we move out the rest of</font>

659
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the script this info part that's just</font>

660
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,769
convenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to uncomment that</font>

661
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,750
for my next part just so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

662
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,490
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it shows you statistics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

663
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,320
information about what kind of video

664
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,570
you're feeding into it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for</font>

665
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,178
debugging your script so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll turn it</font>

666
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:39,000
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on now this is a function i found</font>

667
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,010
in a form system I got it from got some

668
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,409
guy goes by name<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fluff and what it</font>

669
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,090
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it overlays and that's a lot of</font>

670
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:48,510
functions in here that I'm not as

671
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,158
familiar with but I know it works so

672
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,769
that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> di sim scripts are</font>

673
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,440
constructed<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to save this out</font>

674
00:27:52,769 --> 00:28:01,370
and just you can see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean by that</font>

675
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:07,860
info function I uncommented it and

676
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:09,178
you'll see it gives me a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of info</font>

677
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,539
up here about what frame it's currently

678
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:16,529
rendering oh I just double click

679
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:18,419
directly on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avs file yeah that's the</font>

680
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,740
script file and because I have a license

681
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,090
installed windows media player just

682
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,490
automatically will open with

683
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,570
it not all tools necessarily will like

684
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,140
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried dragon droppings in the</font>

685
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:31,020
virtual dub inside the into VLC it won't

686
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,350
necessarily work I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back in</font>

687
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,840
and take out that information thing that

688
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,600
basis tells you like what kind of video

689
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:43,080
you're feeding in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really nice for</font>

690
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,820
doing debugging so I'm up comp that out

691
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,290
and let's actually show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how I would</font>

692
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,659
win to this if I was about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

693
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:55,790
normally uh let's see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice on here</font>

694
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:59,010
i have virtualdub else virtualdub<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

695
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:03,360
don't have to do in this exact order but

696
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:05,879
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be easiest to I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can set up</font>

697
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,229
how I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do my compression the</font>

698
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">first thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I normally do is grow and</font>

699
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,220
audio say full processing because I

700
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:17,610
don't we'll just do a direct stream copy

701
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:21,480
and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> any compression and set lame to</font>

702
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:26,159
use 128-bit or whatever also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go on</font>

703
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:29,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">any video compression and set xvid to do</font>

704
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,320
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generally keep it at four you</font>

705
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,660
have the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing a double pass</font>

706
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,720
but for sake of speed and the fact that

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not hosting in myself as usually end</font>

708
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,010
up having larger videos and most people

709
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,360
watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it via the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video stream anyway now</font>

710
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,520
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> that setting every single time</font>

711
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,810
you load of videos of pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can</font>

712
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:51,120
also save out your settings like you say

713
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:54,500
say processing settings right here i'm

714
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:59,189
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> say load processing settings and</font>

715
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:01,260
point to where i have those processing

716
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,690
settings already saved so it hasn't

717
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,870
memorized that just is a nice little

718
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:12,030
step to a nice little thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to a</font>

719
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:18,389
save time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm go Jack drag and drop</font>

720
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:22,350
the script into a Vig<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux and once</font>

721
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:24,390
inside abig<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux there I go that's what</font>

722
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,800
the video would look like does the input

723
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,750
on the right is what the output would be

724
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,659
is still too big to fit on the screen I

725
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:32,730
can go in I can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just encode</font>

726
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,080
however much but because of how had that

727
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,519
script constructed

728
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,299
it's putting the overlay on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

729
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,240
few frames so I'd missed that overlay

730
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:44,070
but I can choose how much of it to save

731
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,289
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might do is sit there</font>

732
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,928
and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out how many frames I</font>

733
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:52,200
need to take out by<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at what's up</font>

734
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,570
on the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> here versus what's on the</font>

screen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> live video and try to sync</font>

736
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:00,139
them out to be exact though in this case

737
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:02,549
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you all have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

738
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:07,289
deafening of the screen up inside the

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:08,639
live video on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk I I can hopefully</font>

740
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,649
try to piece it together<font color="#CCCCCC"> by listening to</font>

741
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the audio</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get the exact see that's</font>

742
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the part that's the pain in the butt is</font>

743
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,590
to get the two lined up exactly now I'm

744
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">assuming you hit both record on both</font>

745
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,720
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact same time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even then</font>

746
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,439
sometimes you get off by a couple

747
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,639
seconds so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point once I have</font>

748
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:33,870
this video here I could just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

749
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,760
unselect everything I'll just select

750
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:39,928
absolutely if I'm I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way I</font>

751
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:47,010
do file save as an ABI and I choose my

752
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:50,149
desktop let's say out of zone 1 and put

753
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:54,649
a stake of speed let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and just</font>

754
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:59,340
render the first very small pit of his

755
00:31:54,649 --> 00:32:01,018
presentation save as an avi to my

756
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,699
desktop I'll just called overlay

757
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:09,029
autozone 1.avi and you see it's going at

758
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:10,919
about 14 frames a second and increasing

759
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,299
that means it's gonna take me longer to

760
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,950
render it than it did to record it

761
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:16,350
because i'm actually in putting anything

762
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,809
at 25 frames a second but it's picking

763
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,189
up speed as time goes long more likely

764
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first roof frames take longer to</font>

765
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,809
render<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i'm doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that overlay</font>

766
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,889
with the transparency and all that but

767
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:31,769
that's taped out an<font color="#E5E5E5"> AVI so let me close</font>

768
00:32:28,889 --> 00:32:35,809
down virtualdub and let's go see if that

769
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:35,809
avi looks at all decent

770
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:52,090
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had audio working right I</font>

771
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:55,720
should have I should have audio playing

772
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:59,178
but for whatever reason that's not quite

773
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">doin I have turned up I she's already</font>

774
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:06,409
from this hooked up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything okay</font>

775
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,830
that might be why it's not playing it

776
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

777
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,199
bathroom or messing around this in the

778
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,940
back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure audios functioning</font>

779
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:26,080
but that's essentially what the finished

780
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:26,080
video will end up looking like live

781
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:37,039
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that's can we make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

782
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,870
to where we record via the live because

783
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,870
otherwise getting lip sync is impossible

784
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:57,139
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be but so it should be</font>

785
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:58,820
recording audio to both<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it</font>

786
00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:00,019
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there whatever it's not</font>

787
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,070
playing right now and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go back</font>

788
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:10,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and figure that out there's</font>

789
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:11,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">something messed up there oh yeah this</font>

790
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:19,909
look like I see any audio coming in from

791
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:21,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a camera well that's what I got so</font>

792
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:23,119
far so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll actually will</font>

793
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">be some audio in that one eventually I</font>

794
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:31,040
may have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy dog looking like he</font>

795
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:38,659
is enough kung fu<font color="#E5E5E5"> film but we'll see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

796
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:41,270
that all turns out hmm yeah it's

797
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,950
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be it perfect and then a is</font>

798
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,918
far enough away maybe I can get away of

799
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:47,719
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one of a video apply show is I was</font>

800
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,118
doing a sniffles class last weekend and

801
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:53,649
I had a problem where one the video

802
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:58,490
started going really kablooey on me and

803
00:34:53,649 --> 00:35:01,910
me see I had to put a bunch of videos

804
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:04,490
together to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font>

805
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this avi sim2 we had a problem we're in</font>

806
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:13,430
the middle of the slide recording the

807
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:16,819
video failed and i had to replace it

808
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an image saying sorry we lost this</font>

809
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:25,240
section and the way I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got a</font>

810
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,240
little bit more complicated

811
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:34,980
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go in here let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me open up that</font>

812
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,810
sniffles class essentially what i had to

813
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:39,180
do there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to take video one</font>

814
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,759
before the failure video to asset of

815
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,919
failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put in a blank PNG that</font>

816
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,600
announced the information and i looped

817
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:55,040
through and put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of frames it</font>

818
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:55,040
took to get anything back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in sync okay I</font>

819
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:05,880
only have two on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but you can</font>

820
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,400
see here how I basically insert a blank

821
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,750
spot to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that so you can do</font>

822
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,450
tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> din things and i'm not expecting</font>

people to pick up a vag scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BS</font>

825
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,630
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot to it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alicia gives you</font>

looking at that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text is</font>

828
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,510
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to follow and you go out to</font>

829
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,910

830
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:28,470
and explanations on it a lot of times to

831
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,690
give the examples not with the whole

834
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:41,100
still pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to figure out let me</font>

00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,600
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a few less things some</font>

future what I want to work on is

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually being the win of these things</font>

the fact that such a pain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love</font>

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,500
cameras and have the laptop

842
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,420
automatically composite everything

843
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,250
together for me there's a few tools i

844
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,170
found it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that now the better one</font>

845
00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:02,720
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing it is a video blaster</font>

846
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,720
for windows unfortunately it's not free

847
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,520
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> say 500 bucks it does a good</font>

848
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,020
job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had one video why test with it</font>

849
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,759
i lost the audio but generally it does a

850
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">great job and that's see what it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

851
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that picture in a picture then</font>

852
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,890
you can like make one full screen then

853
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,540
switch back and just do all sorts of

854
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,810
weird effects you can do something

855
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,540
similar the open source tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> webcam</font>

856
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,100
studio for linux unfortunately it's

857
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,440
never rendered fast enough to be

858
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">practical for that i can save out an odd</font>

859
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,700
video file but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a slot where</font>

860
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,569
the entire things like a slideshow

861
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,019
person person person

862
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:40,849
it's um written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Java it might be one</font>

863
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:43,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the issues there I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I'm not</font>

864
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:45,650
sure there's mixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear mixed opinions</font>

865
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:47,058
on job and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast it is depending what</font>

866
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,079
you're doing it's probably fine I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

867
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure it's fast enough for video</font>

868
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,099
rendering though but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still a neat</font>

869
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,660
toy to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with and as newer</font>

870
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:55,430
versions come out I might be to get fast

871
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,828
and faster if anybody watches this video

872
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,989
anybody at the conference knows of a

873
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:02,180
