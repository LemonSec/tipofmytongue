some extra hard drives and this was I

100
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,780
guess way back around Def Con 12 or 13

101
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,250
we had friends who actually couldn't

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,180
fill it up with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEF CON</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

107
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,940
black hat talks and that was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

108
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,350
know this much of 25 niggers so we threw

109
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,390
like movies music and everything else we

110
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,460
had like here we'll just send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

111
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:56,110
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think AST carry it over and then pres</font>

112
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,270
got it not sure off and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

113
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,500
kicking around and people like the idea

114
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,940
enough that someone said hey why don't

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,340
we build another one for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> buddy over</font>

116
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,900
here said I can do that and I started

117
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,000
putting together these which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

118
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,880
them traveling terabytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you go</font>

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,470
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling terabyte org you can as you</font>

120
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,760
know skydog that you can see the history

121
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,190
it's kind of this real interesting

122
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,990
window into the evolution of our storage

123
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,850
medium because every time you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

124
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,830
terabyte drives finally came out cheaply

125
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,160
enough then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> switched to those and that</font>

126
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,750
was only one drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and enclosed</font>

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,030
then I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a smaller Pelican case</font>

128
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,370
and then terabyte laptop drives or what

129
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,239
we kind of use now so the enclosures and

130
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,700
everything's getting smaller and smaller

131
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,550
and smaller and cheaper and cheaper and

132
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,349
now the one thing we never could really

133
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,150
reliably do is get the drives back

134
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,190
because the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was will rotate them</font>

135
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,049
around hit a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Units just pass it</font>

136
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,520
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass to your friends then send</font>

137
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,710
them back so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> refresh and update</font>

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,140
with like new episodes and new movie

139
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,150
releases and just just new content it's

140
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,640
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to track once it goes</font>

141
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,409
out in the field and I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

142
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,490
that guy who's like pinging people being

143
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,760
like hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> while you're dodging</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the badges portion there's a reason for</font>

443
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:08,980
that every year prior to this pretty

444
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">much we had a contest that went on were</font>

445
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you on your badge there was two</font>

446
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,280
different numbers or symbols or

447
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,900
something like that a QR code when year

448
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,180
they had two numbers encoded in it and

449
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:21,850
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you figured out what your</font>

450
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,070
code was and then one side of the badge

451
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,600
was your code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side was</font>

452
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:28,360
your partner's code and you had to go

453
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,280
find them in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> crowd of 75 people what</font>

454
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,750
that meant was he actually had to talk

455
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,700
to some people which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great social</font>

456
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,500
thing because you had to walk up and get

457
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,750
close enough to read it if you're that

458
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,290

stuff I got home like a week later<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

547
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,710
there was a seven hundred dollar charge

548
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:13,260
on my debit card at the hot at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Hyatt</font>

549
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,360

550
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,870
else negotiated the hotel not Scott

551
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">because scott knows what he's up to yes</font>

552
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:25,770
yes so I literally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a man</font>

00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,209
with great means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have some memes but</font>

seven hundred dollars a disappeared I

555
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,970
was like this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that chick</font>

557
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,850

558
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,650

put your signature on it and see line so

844
00:38:47,789 --> 00:38:51,299
one of the things we do every year we

845
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,880
have an auction last<font color="#CCCCCC"> year I took some</font>

846
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:55,799
artwork that I made that actually was

847
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,460
what was on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the banners and things</font>

848
00:38:55,799 --> 00:39:01,020
like that in the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

849
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:02,520
driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a video</font>

850
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,619
camera or whatever in the corner of my

851
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:10,130
glass hey it was simulated I had a

852
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:12,920
rolling yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

853
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:16,829
yeah yeah it was simulated that's where

854
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,000
in the same way that I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some</font>

855
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:21,210
odd things every once in a while and

856
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're halfway decent ideas we we have</font>

857
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:25,079
done some graphics before and made them

858
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:28,078
available for auction last year's trick

859
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:29,910
bought our piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> artwork which i am</font>

860
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,920
not an artist if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a ruler and</font>

861
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:36,149
a pencil<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can draw a straight line I</font>

862
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate him buying that last year and</font>

863
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,680
the auction so what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year is</font>

864
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,440
I had extra banners printed we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

865
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,799
of our sponsors on the banner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

866
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,049
graphics<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we decided to do was we</font>

867
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:51,900
would auction off the banners or one of

868
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:53,430
the Landers rather with all of the staff

869
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,740
signatures although the speaker

870
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,410
signatures and all of the sponsor

871
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:03,779
signatures on it so and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

872
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:07,319
we do you need a new cloak because we're

873
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:09,869
terrible so so what we do is we auction

874
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:13,500
something every year to try to augment

875
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:15,539
what we bring in and it's sometimes it

876
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,250
gets heated sometimes someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up</font>

877
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:19,950
with a complex equation what was the

878
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:23,220
equation last year straight come on man

879
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:25,348
I actually took a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the</font>

880
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,629
memo field of the check that had some

881
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:29,010
equation you came up with I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

882
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:36,930
mathematician I couldn't figure it out

883
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:39,180
so so of the two banners one of them

884
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,740
actually is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my office</font>

885
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,419
and be one more thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my boss</font>

886
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,759
doesn't understand why it stuck to my

887
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:49,920
wall another one we're actually going to

888
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:53,640
auction off so it's a piece of history

889
00:40:49,920 --> 00:41:00,990
well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like I say it's everyone</font>

description<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the crypto contest takes</font>

936
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,070
about 12 minutes and it is the most

937
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex mind-numbing thing I've ever</font>

938
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,270
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my life they lose me at step two</font>

939
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,618
you know they're like it's a one-time

940
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,140
pad and you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this blah blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

941
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,869
I'm like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have time to do</font>

942
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,368
that so I put this one together it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

943
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:38,880
very difficult the center section of the

944
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:42,210
code was actually killed a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wabbit if you</font>

945
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,000
looked further down into the code there

946
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,850
was a I believe it's an eight digit

947
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,660
hexadecimal code right who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

948
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:53,730
schedule with them here's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

949
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,629
what did you notice about the numbers on

950
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the spine of the schedule</font>

951
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:04,150
really you need to put the assertive

952
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:08,070
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of push what you saw was a</font>

953
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,070
hexadecimal number being converted to

954
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:17,080
huh no it was being converted just to a

955
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,810
regular decimal number just you know

956
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:23,680
regular numbers not the difficult ones

957
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,870
that was a clue in that that hexadecimal

958
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,810
number that is actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> badge</font>

959
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:32,770
might be converted into a regular

960
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:35,410
decimal number right base 10 right so

961
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:39,480
another section of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the schedule</font>

962
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:44,379
actually had a link HTTP blah blah blah

963
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,990
ozie seven blanks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the clue to</font>

964
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,960
put in the number that you found in the

965
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:52,120
center section it was 53 blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

966
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:55,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was like eight characters long if you</font>

967
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,490
went there if you got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> far you could</font>

968
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,470
have figured out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font>

969
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,890
character spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the username and</font>

970
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,629
password to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through the HD password</font>

971
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:07,359
authentication to get you to the page

972
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:09,760
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to the page you had killed</font>

973
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,220
the wabbit there was the dead bunny logo

974
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the back of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my shirt that was</font>

975
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:17,589
there when you went in you put your user

976
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">or your your name your email address and</font>

977
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:20,530
you can make whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny coming you</font>

978
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,370
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would send it to my phone</font>

979
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:26,380
