00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,760
good afternoon everybody so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,400
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here talking today about mobile</font>

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:17,609
devices applications things like that I

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,750
kind of put to get this thanks Keith put

5
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,949
the presentation together the kind of

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,210
last minute so there's a lot of

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:27,119
temporary place holder things in here no

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,910
I did it last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night at 3am after</font>

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,830
drinking half of it as drinking half of

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,210
it is hungover you can tell which half

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,420
is is which so who in here has a mobile

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,500
device of<font color="#CCCCCC"> any kind Wow pretty much</font>

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,969
everybody how what a shocker there who

14
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,850
in the room thinks that their mobile

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:56,010
device is pretty secure Rick Rick you do

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:58,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay oh good sarcasm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah yeah some of</font>

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,599
them are better than others but but in

18
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,820
general they're not all that secure the

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,439
reason why is kind of because right is

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,869
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things have come out it's</font>

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,210
primarily then consumerism that's driven

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">him right so how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people stood in</font>

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,649
line for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipad 2 I don't want to show</font>

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,539
a hand please but just like you can

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,130
drive around best buy Billy I think you

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,180
were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about earlier they're like</font>

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,119
lines and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving out tickets</font>

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the iPad all right well one of the</font>

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,990
reasons that mobile devices have become

30
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,580
so hot is because they're they're really

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,670
cool to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and really cool to do stuff</font>

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,130
with but now if you think about a

33
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,020
corporate organization they have to deal

34
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this right hey I want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,100
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work from pretty much anywhere</font>

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,590
the hot tub all right why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I'm a</font>

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">has really driven these things into the</font>

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,658
enterprise and there's a lot of security

42
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns obviously enterprises have that</font>

43
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:59,310
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasons and i'll hope to</font>

44
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,159
cover most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that Who I am why you</font>

45
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,780
should care not a coder I just talked to

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,610
people I can read I've got security

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,890
experience put all those things together

48
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,989
that means that you can spend two or

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,790
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months really like reading through</font>

50
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,380
stuff talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people researching and</font>

51
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,019
get a pretty good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

project I like to say that really I'm

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,900
just on the mailing list it's all it

58

takes on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source project right</font>

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,530
now you remember and so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretend</font>

60
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,600
to know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all but uh but I I know a</font>

61
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,430
good bit and maybe I can educate some of

62
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,010
you hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can educate me that's</font>

63
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,730
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really looking for here so give</font>

64
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,950
me your stories additions comments throw

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">them out keep it keep it count on topic</font>

66
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,760
I know this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> group and other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta</font>

67
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,190
security groups tend to get off topic

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,620
and so that's fine too so<font color="#CCCCCC"> genda talk</font>

69
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,270
about some email bad stuff some general

70
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,770
security issues when deploying mobile

71
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,020
devices in an enterprise type

72
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,420
environment mistakes that developers

73
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,630
commonly make there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of them not</font>

74
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,859
limited to web to mobile apps and then

75
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,630
what to look for when you're doing a

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,280
risk assessment and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what's</font>

77
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,109
in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what do I see out on</font>

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,970
the horizon again not that I know

79
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,050
anything but I've read some things that

80
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people have said or out on the</font>

81
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,910
horizon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I copied them so email right</font>

82
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,950
everybody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check email on their</font>

83
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,620
little mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> device that they can take</font>

84
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,420
off at noon and go have a beer with

85
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,410
lunch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not come back until the yeah</font>

86
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,269
come back all day long but a lot of

87
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:44,070
times the way it's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really really</font>

88
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:46,080
bad right smtp pop clear text on an

89
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,239
unencrypted device you just begging for

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,280
problems because now when you're

91
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,410
transmitting your login password that's

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,150
over the air either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weather it's</font>

93
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,220
Wi-Fi whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's cell phone network</font>

94
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,400
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need of those is really private</font>

95
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,490
anymore and you're storing anything you

96
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,770
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> down an unencrypted device so if</font>

97
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose it you've essentially lost that</font>

98
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:10,970
data just a bad bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to get</font>

99
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,040
this one out make it its own category

100
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,519
fight back against anybody who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,690
do this you know don't punch them but

102
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,608
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a bad idea and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

103
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,690
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place some big companies who</font>

104
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,710
ought to know better

105
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,510
security issues with deploy mobile

106
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,210
devices mainly this is targeted at

107
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:34,639
enterprise environments so duck you pay

108
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:37,159
attention first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing let's talk about</font>

109
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,220
is network security right yeah you

110
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,840
control your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think but when</font>

111
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go to a coffee shop you don't</font>

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,650
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> that network you don't know who</font>

113
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,110
t-mobile or AT&T or whoever it is has

114
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,429
sit in the back rooms like looking at

115
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,770
packets as they go through and clear

116
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,330
text you don't know what the the guy

117
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,180
right next to you at the coffee shop is

118
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,430
doing he could be me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

119
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,320
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireshark ER or one of those</font>

120
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,970
tools to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your packets sniff your</font>

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,240
data and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> break in I recently</font>

122
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,979
lost my itunes account my apple ID was

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,810
compromised right I don't know how it

124
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,909
happened but I suspect it was probably a

125
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,790
really badly coded app at a Wi-Fi

126
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,070
hotspot oh well change the password

127
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:22,700
paypal<font color="#E5E5E5"> reimbursed me all my money I'm</font>

128
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,800
back up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font>

129
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,750
the real risk right is that somebody is

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,520
going to sniff the network traffic get

131
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,810
that log in a password or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

132
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about like a mobile banking app</font>

133
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,370
if you do it really badly somebody could

134
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,380
man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle it present a fake</font>

135
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,180
certificate and then do transactions as

136
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,700
you hopefully you've limited the amount

137
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,160
of transactions you can do but there's

138
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,860
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps is particularly the</font>

139
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,610
ones that are industry specific like

140
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,169
especially medical apps there there's

141
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,880
not a ton of security that goes into the

142
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">development of those so when you're</font>

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,800
putting this app out does mobile device

144
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,660
out to your employees<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the folks who</font>

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,260
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it keep that in mind</font>

146
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:07,220
and make everything go back over a VPN

147
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,950
tunnel at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> least from the paypal</font>

148
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,169
app had a problem I read<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where</font>

149
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,780
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't properly doing certificates</font>

150
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,400
i believe so essentially any certificate

151
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,739
that you would present it if it was

152
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,169
invalid certificate the app just kind of

153
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,950
defaulted to allow it's not really good

154
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:25,840
right

155
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:28,479
and sixty-eight percent of apps have

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,700
have a problem with transmitting data

157
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,710
and clear text even if it's just a

158
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,630
session ID or a cookie of course

159
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,640
everybody ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know by now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from web</font>

160
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:40,000
applications you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take those and</font>

161
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,880
replay them right there just keep that

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind when you're deploying mobile</font>

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,420
apps local device storage anybody think

164
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,719
it's a good idea to store any sensitive

165
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:58,090
information on a mobile device good pass

166
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:00,100
the test yeah not good as Scott<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I'm</font>

167
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,070
sure tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you put data on</font>

168
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,440
that SSD the the solid-state drive on

169
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,150
there you really can't ever wipe it so a

170
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,580
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times some of these apps will</font>

171
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,870
have like a white function or something

172
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think is going to then wipe it</font>

173
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,650
but every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you read that data</font>

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,060
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scotts presentation from</font>

175
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,880
what I remember a few years ago from

176
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,410
shmoocon every time you read the data it

177
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually puts it somewhere else on the</font>

178
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,220
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> Somu it's constantly moving this</font>

179
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,770
data around all you have to do if you

180
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,750
lose that if somebody loses that device

181
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,789
I go pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped a forensics</font>

182
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:34,330
image of it and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably pick up</font>

183
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:45,020
some data and that was Scott<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hot</font>

184
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:56,740
electron injection talk okay

185
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:58,758
thank you well know is there yeah so

186
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,500
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything that you're going</font>

187
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to store on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the device you ought to</font>

188
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,620
encrypt it you ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,659
your your apps are encrypting it when

190
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,039
you go to roll it out even if they say

191
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:11,120
they're doing it securely a lot of times

192
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,280
they're not of course good is email

193
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">client it has an encrypted container</font>

194
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,888
essentially so everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

195
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,800
should be encrypted in there speaking of

196
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,780
good another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want</font>

197
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,090
to consider is I said it an alert for

198
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,650
myself for what to to something and in

199
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,088
the good app one of the really weird

200
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,490
things I know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to see back</font>

201
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:38,659
there but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will actually tell you the</font>

202
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:40,310
meeting name and the call bridge in the

203
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,289
alert that pops up even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

204
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">logged into the app I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> found this</font>

205
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,579
out yesterday when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was playing around</font>

206
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,260
with it so now if I lose this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and</font>

207
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,870
somebody picks it up it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

208
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,850
you know talk with the CEO and here's

209
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,750
the call bridge or discuss this really

210
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,089
you know I mean probably not great

211
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,950
security right to display that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

212
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,779
information to somebody who's not logged

213
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,870
in to your to your system into your app

214
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,370
so keep that in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up now</font>

215
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,720
not because it's related to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic</font>

216
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,480
but because the alarm went off<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

217
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,550
set for myself connecting back into your

218
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,000
network if you are giving out these

219
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">iPads or whatever android device windows</font>

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,020
based device how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it going to connect</font>

221
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,260
back into your network I've seen a lot

222
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,180
of times where people will just let it

223
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,589
come back in through like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a some kind of</font>

224
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,989
a web account or they might have it

225
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,510
routed into their system you know for

226
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,020
example asn over the cellular network

227
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,700
it's like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a private ASM in which</font>

228
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,920
is basically routing it directly to your

229
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate environment so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

230
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,510
t-mobile network or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vodafone network</font>

231
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:49,459
or AT&T network whatever that's not

232
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,020
encrypted right i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted</font>

233
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way that all cell phone stuff</font>

234
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,790
is encrypted but it's really not

235
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,760
encrypted

236
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,730
right so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can any any time it</font>

237
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,520
goes from the base station at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tower</font>

238
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,410
back to you that's not encrypted at all

239
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,819
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to use VPN and then</font>

240
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,890
when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a Wi-Fi network of course</font>

241
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,230
it's not encrypted anyway so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn</font>

242
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,090
private asn doesn't necessarily do you

243
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,230
any good in coffee shops and those kinds

244
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,390
of things and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone network</font>

245
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,500
it's pretty much broke and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there have</font>

246
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,990
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of talks that are really</font>

247
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,270
interesting this past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at Def Con if</font>

248
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,340
you went to there was one day where they

249
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,720
had like a two or three-hour block but I

250
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,220
said don't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cell phones if you</font>

251
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,880
care about privacy because we're going

252
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cracking cell phone transmissions</font>

253
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,860
so keep that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this one is started</font>

254
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,330
to pop up a lot more frequently recently

255
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,950
rogue apps right there are some rogue

256
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,450
apps out there that might do some things

257
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:49,980
like try and steal passwords there was I

258
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,260
heard a report I never looked into it

259
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,420
too much and I didn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it confirmed</font>

260
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,689
anywhere but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android app store</font>

261
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,819
there was some rogue online banking apps

262
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,470
right so it might be posing as a bank

263
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,210
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> download that app put your</font>

264
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,540
information into it they go you know

265
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,340
check my balance or whatever you do yeah

266
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,490
your password just<font color="#E5E5E5"> went off to the</font>

267
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">flatty and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Romania and now he's</font>

268
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:17,490
checking your balance for you making

269
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,990
sure that stays just above zero 10,000

270
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,600
apps per day in the apple store<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font>

271
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:25,920
that somewhere that's a lot you can't

272
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,660
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> check all those I mean Apple not</font>

273
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">even an Apple Genius can check all those</font>

274
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,880
right

275
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:36,520
not in a day there's also been live

276
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,550
malware found and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the expert on</font>

277
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,800
on mobile malware I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking Don</font>

278
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,750
Jackson might be here he's done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

279
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,969
research on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but it's like</font>

280
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's several different mobile malware</font>

281
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,339
kits that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out there starting</font>

282
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:54,190
to become more common kind of like the

283
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,710
mobile web or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web malware kits</font>

284
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,390
where you just kind of drag and drop a

285
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">point and click here's your little</font>

286
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,380
malware thing it'll phone oh of course

287
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,260
probably a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people remember the</font>

288
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">key or I key virus that went around on</font>

289
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,910
the iPhones that it would rickroll you

290
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,160
that was pretty cool i actually had that

291
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,449
as my as my background for a while

292
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,640
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just thought the background in</font>

293
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,240
school I didn't get actually hacked so I

294
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,860
say how do you update these things if

295
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,910
you're an enterprise environment you

296
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,470
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

297
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,630
running compatible versions of the

298
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,390
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secure versions of the</font>

299
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,630
software so do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plug in do</font>

300
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,490
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be tethered to a device can</font>

301
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> push that out over the air some</font>

302
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,700
applications allow you to do that some

303
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,990
bubble cryptic containers allow you to

304
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,760
do that there are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of</font>

305
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,420
doing it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

306
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and various this was the part of the</font>

307
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,860
thing I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together last night</font>

308
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,649
you're right and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the corporate</font>

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,270
data plans are there metered right you

310
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:15,550
paid by the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Killa by pay by the</font>

311
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:18,370
megabyte sure yeah yes ownership is a

312
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:20,319
big one it's a huge question a lot of a

313
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,270
lot of companies have started saying you

314
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,670
got to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own device that</font>

315
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,730
poses a lot of problems sure it cuts

316
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,560
down on costs a little bit but in the

317
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,120
long run does it really because now you

318
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,380
have to have this special software that

319
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,450
you put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take up</font>

320
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,300
Ducky's time so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug you into the</font>

321
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:40,420
to the thing get you set up when

322
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,270
something's broken who does the employee

323
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,449
call do they call IT support hey I can't

324
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:49,660
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell phone call with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my phone or</font>

325
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">why care call tmobile right but that</font>

326
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">still would take time if it's a high</font>

327
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,330
enough level executive you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

328
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:02,050
dragged into supporting that phone for

329
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:04,029
them you can't as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an organization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

330
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,510
have the latest and greatest mobile

device<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to everybody especially in</font>

332
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,580
medical environments and hospitals the

333
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,250
doctors want the latest coolest device

334
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,050
they want their own device configuration

335
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">right like there might be a doctor out</font>

336
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is like Oh Windows is the best</font>

337
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,750
platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> no android is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best by</font>

338
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,240
former no iOS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best platform or</font>

339
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,589
whatever your platform of choice is the

340
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">doctors are going to want their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

341
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,810
thing because they're very picky so you

342
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,029
might end up having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support someone</font>

343
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:37,199
else's device for them so the best thing

344
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:40,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do here is to publish standards</font>

345
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,670
that say in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our network</font>

346
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,620
to use our apps to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that you</font>

347
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,089
have to meet this<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard that'll allow</font>

348
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,350
you to kick back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of the devices</font>

349
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:48,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at and you just like</font>

350
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,980
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you're putting that on my</font>

351
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:56,020
network and device management so you can

352
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,089
remotely wipe some of these devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

353
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,550
lot of them depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you set it</font>

354
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,430
up

355
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,290
but if you know for example that have

356
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,540
ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> dies and you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

357
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,579
apple store and get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your new new thing</font>

358
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:11,300
just switched out now you can trim a

359
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,740
wipe that right so if you're a you've

360
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,569
got sensitive data on there you might

361
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,540
have to disclose that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the government</font>

362
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,360
that's never cool why are you disposing

363
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,680
this data well because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I phone died guy</font>

364
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,470
brought it back and we couldn't wipe it

365
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,329
sorry so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you do in that case I</font>

366
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,149
mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess you can buy the guy's phone</font>

367
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,800
from him but that's not a good policy

368
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,660
because then you just do an upgrades

369
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,430
every time the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone or the next</font>

370
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,990
Android device comes out you're

371
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,149
basically subsidizing all your employees

372
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,850
to go out and buy new devices so that

373
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:42,110
sucks enforcing security is a little bit

374
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,720
different on mobile devices you know

375
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,600
it's none of this is easy it as it as it

376
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">is on laptops or other kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

377
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,649
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have liked laptop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

378
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">desktop server there's not just a push</font>

379
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:57,350
domain structure that you really have

380
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,149
they're not mature right now and then

381
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,350
again you kind of have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of if</font>

382
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over the air how do you</font>

383
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,430
protect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it has to be on Wi-Fi or</font>

384
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,939
if it has to be tethered<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you push</font>

385
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,550
those things down and then you know

386
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,680
again who supports it kind of how do you

387
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,990
disentangle the management from the

388
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the employee to the</font>

389
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:21,800
organization to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor to the user</font>

390
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:26,720
you know there's tons of layers there on

391
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:32,029
how you how you would manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now</font>

392
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,010
move into app mistakes not to make a lot

393
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them careful how you use in store</font>

394
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:40,279
data be careful how you use in store

395
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:42,649
data don't store sensitive data if you

396
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:44,240
can help it right that's the the biggest

397
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:45,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">mistake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think people make is they just</font>

398
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,540
assume that encryption will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of</font>

399
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,399
something or that will wipe it later or

400
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,829
whatever if you don't have to store that

401
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,870
data don't store it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font>

402
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:56,689
your app won't be designed to cache

403
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,029
things but sometimes you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> help it</font>

404
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,060
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens encrypt the data</font>

405
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,920
as much as you can there was a citibank

406
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,230
app recently that was discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

407
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,699
that was in october november that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

408
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,319
toward the username and password and

409
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:14,120
clear text bad dumb mistake of course

410
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,559
hopefully they've got other mechanisms

411
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,559
to protect the security of the account

412
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:22,490
but don't store user name and password

413
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text encrypt the communication</font>

414
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do it right like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if</font>

415
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,339
you're accepting any certificate as a

416
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:30,290
valid certificate you're defeating the

417
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:32,540
whole purpose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> raises the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bar about</font>

418
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,639
that much for the attacker to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

419
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,830
get in it really doesn't do anything to

420
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,150
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it secure it a lot of times what</font>

421
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">will happen is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

422
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,929
custom certificate like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want to</font>

423
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay you know whoever to get this cert</font>

424
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make my own and there's not</font>

425
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,230
really a mechanism to update that cert

426
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,418
on the device except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for update the app</font>

427
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,179
or whatever the issue is maybe you're

428
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:55,040
leaving in debug code from when you're

429
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,290
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just test it and so it'll just</font>

430
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,750
accept any certificate don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

431
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,120
that's dumb and again even the cell

432
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,330
phone network can be broken so<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

433
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,699
assume that it's a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> line there's</font>

434
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:11,030
this concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a private line that goes</font>

435
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,130
back forever back to two modems and ISDN

436
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,050
and even fax is still considered to be a

437
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">private line so you can send unencrypted</font>

438
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,470
data across it well hey that's great but

439
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:22,550
what happens when your private line is a

440
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,110
party line you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have problems same thing</font>

441
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,659
happened with Wi-Fi people keep making

442
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,668
the same mistakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and over again</font>

443
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:33,169
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they ought to</font>

444
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:34,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">hire me take in to consider into</font>

445
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:37,070
consideration the platform specific

446
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,129
differences each platform does things

447
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:42,899
differently for example backgrounding

448
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,950
when you background an app on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone</font>

449
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,930
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one it takes a</font>

450
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,900
screenshot of the app and stores that

451
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:51,540
writes it can do the cool little go down

452
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,830
effect and backup effect and it also

453
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:58,050
takes that app out of memory and puts it

454
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,330
into some special area and then you just

455
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">have api calls to it i don't know</font>

456
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,199
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> how all that works again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

457
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,970
a coder on the android apparently it

458
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,370
does it differently it just freezes the

459
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,930
app stores it in memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the app</font>

460
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,580
can't do anything will is there at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

461
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:13,140
on the iphone right it can it can kind

462
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of log you out or make you put in</font>

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,010
another credential when you come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> android from what i understand it</font>

465
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:21,720
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> freezes it and holds it and a lot</font>

466
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,240
of these functionality from what i

467
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,250
understand you can disable when you're

468
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,230
coding an app you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say don't use this</font>

469
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:30,660
function don't use that function there's

470
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,360
a keyboard caching function apparently

471
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey that's cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm a bad guy just</font>

472
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,879
took that keyboard caching function and

473
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,860
I've got all your cached keystrokes I

474
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,340
don't know how far back that goes but

475
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:48,330
that's not a good thing you I pasteboard

476
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,370
cutting and pasting it's a fairly common

477
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,919
thing probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be cutting and</font>

478
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,030
pasting your password I would doubt

479
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,500
somebody would do that but you might

480
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sensitive information in there</font>

481
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,370
if you're an app developer just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

482
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,290
allow that to be used don't a lot of

483
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that function to be used you should be</font>

484
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok their web services when you're</font>

485
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,400
programming an application that talks

486
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,889
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything inside</font>

487
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,860
your organization or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cloud or wherever</font>

488
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:18,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it has to talk over over that that</font>

489
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to a server on the back end</font>

490
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:26,550
right most app developers that I've run

491
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,409
across don't consider this as nearly as

492
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,570
much as their application right they

493
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:34,500
think security is in the device security

494
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,020
is in the device now who here has done

495
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,300
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of web hacking where you put a</font>

496
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,970
proxy in line and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then send bad data or</font>

497
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:45,060
some kind of other data across right

498
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,220
yeah I know a lot of people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here have</font>

499
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:50,300
don't trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> a client if you're a server</font>

500
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,000
don't trust the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if there's a</font>

501
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:56,190
encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel you got SSL protection</font>

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,610
that doesn't help right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

503
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,260
help for that so I've actually seen some

504
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,479
applications which have sequel injection

505
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,480
in them right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a structured</font>

506
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,430
query like query language type that

507
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,770
whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML feed I forgot that's</font>

508
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,660
even stands for but it's a structured

509
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,110
way to look at it rather than the web

510
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,810
interface which is all nice and gooey

511
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:21,510
but you can still send bad data into

512
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:22,980
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML environment and the app</font>

513
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,440
developers a lot of times don't count on

514
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,990
Billy now we're talking you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

515
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,870
when people test these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and bad</font>

516
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:33,690
data goes in the guy on the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

517
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,020
says you're testing equipment is broken

518
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,670
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it follows these rules right</font>

519
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,830
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss the whole point of this is</font>

520
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,200
this potential security risk you know

521
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if you can't get data out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

522
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:50,190
you can still put junk data in so now if

523
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,560
I find a some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a buffer overflow</font>

524
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,060
on your app I can store something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

525
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,040
every time so many queries a certain

526
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,010
thing all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> it overflows the</font>

527
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,090
app and I've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data or whatever</font>

528
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,070
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to probably still data out of</font>

529
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">your database just through your your web</font>

530
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,760
service people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

531
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,820
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the pretty friendly</font>

532
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,440
interface it's not hackable like a web

533
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,149
app but it's essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a web app and</font>

534
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,470
probably with less security<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

535
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,730
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have quite as many people beating</font>

536
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,400
on it and recognizing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

537
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:22,380
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

538
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
what you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for in a risk</font>

539
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,410
assessment when you're doing a risk

540
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,440
assessment especially like in in a

541
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,990
corporate environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your boss</font>

542
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,680
is saying we really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

543
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobile platform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there so</font>

544
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,060
somebody can work from the hot tub or

545
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,520
when they're on vacation or whatever it

546
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,929
is so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the things to</font>

547
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,180
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at first function on the business</font>

548
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:47,160
focus on the business functions that

549
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,050
this mobile device and mobile

550
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,110
application would be doing right what

551
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">type of data will you be accessing what</font>

552
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,860
type of things will you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with it</font>

553
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,930
if it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a check email you might be</font>

554
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,939
able to push back and say and it's

555
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,020
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

556
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,120
there's like millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars</font>

557
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,560
attached to it you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

558
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,000
have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right you're going to</font>

559
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,210
have to allow these mobile devices in

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,770
your environment but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit the</font>

561
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,810
types of things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do on those</font>

562
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,150
so if there's a specific thing that's

563
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,710
driving the millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars then you</font>

564
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,540
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> exclude everything else from the</font>

565
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,050
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> device from having to support it</font>

566
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,270
on that that device so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

567
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:27,060
things that we've seen is where people

568
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">come to us and that's basically their</font>

569
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,550
scenario CEO says he wants mobile

570
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:35,580
devices in the hands of our you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know say</font>

571
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,720

572
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,550
they're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big fourth of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font>

573
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
thing and trying to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and get new</font>

574
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,260
people signed up in the parking lot or

575
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,699
whatever right mobile app well what are

576
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,590
you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for and then take</font>

577
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,450
everything else off and protect the

578
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:52,470
stuff that you your you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave on</font>

579
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:53,940
there pretty well keep in mind threats

580
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,650
and vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean these are all</font>

581
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,180
a lot of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly standard risk</font>

582
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,220
assessment type things but think about

583
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,970
them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of mobile devices</font>

584
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,250
and compliance issues I like compliance

585
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,560
issues because you can sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

586
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,630
bring those up and your problems of

587
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,190
bringing this new risky technology go

588
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,990
away well you know if we lose that

589
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:16,230
device and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this we have to</font>

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,330
provisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'll rethink this or</font>

594
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,370
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we lose this this is a lot</font>

595
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,540
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> glba data is a lot of our bank</font>

596
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,429
customer information that can

597
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,690

598
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,620
have to notify all those people that

we've reached their data

600
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:42,409
it it can make things go away fairly

601
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:45,470
quickly and what's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's out there</font>

602
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,330
on the horizon malicious code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

603
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,310
becoming a much much bigger thing I

604
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:52,280
think we're going to see the rise of

605
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:57,139
mobile malicious code in probably 2011

606
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,870
late 2011 2012 just my hunch probably a

607
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,520
lot of malware a lot more rogue apps I

608
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,070
don't know if you guys heard about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

611
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,740
and then you can do credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card</font>

612
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,600
transactions well it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a threat</font>

the ones who make the hard terminals and

615
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,750
you swipe the card so they wrote a

616
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,550
malicious app that steals credit card

617
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,120

other security precautions so that

pretty mature program squares of devices

633

are not built for that so as you start

634
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,860
to see these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting more</font>

635
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,750
commercialized and more things added on

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile device you'll start to see</font>

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,700
more malware coming out to take that

638
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,410
information right as more banking apps

639
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,820
come out you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see things that are</font>

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hook in and steal bank</font>

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,189
malicious ads is something we haven't

<font color="#CCCCCC">about it a lot of these apps are ad</font>

646
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,159
from sticking a malicious ad in there

647
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,590
that maybe forces you to go to a certain

<font color="#E5E5E5">web page and says security has been</font>

bank account from the web page instead

651
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,240

been several jailbreaks for the iphone

that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do over a web browser it's</font>

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,290
pretty cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good if you're trying</font>

658
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:53,930
to jailbreak it's not good for security

661
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,410
it's perfectly reasonable to think that

you know bad guy might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

again comes back to economics you got

get that critical mass on one platform

692
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:21,250
or on one place and you have people who

about it that's kind of a the way it

about I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

715
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,529
would spread and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

716
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,749
would open up new realizations that

717
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:25,139
people would have about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and</font>

718
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:27,779
mobile electronic technology but it's

719
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:30,779
still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential issue I mean yeah be a</font>

720
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:35,220
cool project if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have no ethics and</font>

721
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:37,200
scruples and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it's</font>

722
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,590
certainly certainly a risk certainly an

723
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,320
issue heard a story about an

724
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,820
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was found out they</font>

725
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,769
were being penetrated because there was

726
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,619
somebody who brought their laptop into a

727
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:51,269
server room don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me why but</font>

728
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,709
apparently the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server's had bluetooth</font>

729
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:57,539
and so they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keyboard</font>

730
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:01,590
functionality on the bluetooth on the

731
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:03,929
server to basically repurpose the the

732
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,928
laptop to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I don't know</font>

733
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:11,549
that this is true but it sounds cool as

734
00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:13,139
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think so bluetooth Wi-Fi this</font>

735
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,850
things that communicate they're

736
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:17,969
definitely embedded in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I mean the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cell phone part of it the chip part of</font>

738
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,909
it so it's possible we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that be</font>

739
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,139
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some people doing it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Def</font>

741
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:32,248

742
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">a hopeless cause there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

743
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:36,470
attention being paid to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

744
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,789

745
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,980
getting on board with security on these

746
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:42,299
types of projects quicker right they've

747
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned from their mistakes of the past</font>

748
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:47,509
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be targeted you know</font>

749
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:50,759
Microsoft doesn't want to be the the

their face that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so they're</font>

752
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,600
taking mobile security more seriously

753
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,640
with

754
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,959
their windows phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've</font>

755
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,120
heard it's actually pretty decent

756
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,220
they've put a lot of the lessons they

757
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,610
learned on their desktop apps and on

758
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,890
their desktop operating systems into the

759
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,168
phone 7 operating system it's not as

760
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,179
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it could be but it's coming it's</font>

761
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,520
a tiny device not a lot of processor not

762
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of RAM so is those devices get</font>

763
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,070
better you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do more things</font>

764
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,720
in security with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> owasp mobile</font>

00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,630
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> already if you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

767
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of thing get on their mailing</font>

768
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:30,510
list it's still beta or alpha but you

769
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:32,250
can help contribute to that bear code

770
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,900
has a top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 list that they published</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

771
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,580
think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple other folks have a top 10</font>

772
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:41,130
or top x of things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> go wrong tend to</font>

773
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,760
go wrong with coding mobile applications

774
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:45,990
so check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff out there's a lot of</font>

775
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,600
people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in this space right</font>

776
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:53,520
now because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hot so that's</font>

777
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,260
that's my talk it was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> short I</font>

778
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,049
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank all the all these cool</font>

779
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,870
folks and if you guys want to ask

780
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:04,429
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be that would be</font>

781
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,428
good yes

782
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:09,490
sure because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about risk right it</font>

783
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes down to the risk profile I'm</font>

784
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,620
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tolerate a certain amount of</font>

785
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,389
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't have a ton of stuff on</font>

786
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,219
this I mean I use it kind of as a phone

787
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:21,700
I've gotten away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from being a</font>

788
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:23,590
technophile I'm almost you know getting

789
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,290
to be more and more illiterate on these

790
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:28,330
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I have a mobile</font>

791
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:31,090
banking app but just to test it I don't

792
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:33,370
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything I gotta say it's</font>

793
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:36,490
kind of crappy the authentication it has

794
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:40,389
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a thing has to be a six digit</font>

795
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:46,590
numeric code it's like really have we

796
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:49,090
gone backwards in time no of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

797
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:53,730
it does have a cool thing where you have

798
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:55,659
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the their website and</font>

799
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,640
you have to go to their website and

800
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,670
authorize and say yes I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

801
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,830
to allow a mobile application to see my

802
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,350
balance all I can do is see a balance

803
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,149
and pay a bill right builders that are

804
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,459
already set up and that have bills due

805
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:13,390
currently so they've limited the risk

806
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,060
there it goes goes back to risk it's

807
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:18,580
cool thing I love whipping it out when

808
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,810
I've got a song I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the name</font>

809
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,899
of and just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Shazam i tells me what</font>

810
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,379
the song is or when I want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cool</font>

811
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:32,020
new restaurant pop open urbanspoon or

812
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,030
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to calculate numbers higher</font>

813
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,150
than i can count on my fingers there you

814
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,149
go

815
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:43,510
we use email on it good good like I said

816
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's encrypted container so it protects</font>

817
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:48,549
it pretty well we did a pretty extensive

818
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,470
vetting of that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

819
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:53,549
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> good that's the only thing</font>

820
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,549
corporate I can do on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

821
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,379
how much risk to I see coming from

822
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,650
mobile desktop applications Oh remote

823
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:08,389
desktop yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some</font>

824
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,060
potential risk there obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've</font>

825
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:13,310
got like go to my pc or log me in or one

826
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,619
of those other ones where you can you

827
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,840
know again comes down at that point to

828
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,200
the authentication is it just I've got

829
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,850
the device therefore I am legitimate a

830
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,069
legitimate user that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad security</font>

831
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,500
model I think if you do it right and

832
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,179
have some kind of a multi-factor

833
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,619
authentication whether it's an

834
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:33,080
additional password that you would put

835
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:35,750
in whether it's you know setting it up

836
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:39,529
specific to a unique ID on the phone

837
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:42,590
that's it can potentially be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a factor</font>

838
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,200
and it comes down to what is the risk

839
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,419
versus what it allows you to do so now

840
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:50,178
if your IT support guy can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> log me</font>

841
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:52,250
in on his on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone and get and it</font>

842
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,830
starts supporting people when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

843
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else that's a business enabler</font>

844
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:00,080
I would see that is not as much of

845
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">business enabler as some people might</font>

846
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">initially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think because IT guys always</font>

847
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:08,810
carry on laptops anyways just pull that

848
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing out hop on a Wi-Fi hotspot or get</font>

849
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,290
them a 3g<font color="#CCCCCC"> card or something like that</font>

850
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,868
let them do it with the full desktop

851
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,369
we've got more control over that so that

852
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:18,260
would be my advice to enterprises on

853
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:21,920
remote desktop applications on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

854
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:23,840
mobile mobile platforms still out there

855
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,640
it's still kind of cool and for just

856
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,900
using inside my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> house I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

857
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:33,670
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but I don't want to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

858
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:33,670
so I don't yeah Billy

859
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:50,860
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't tested clear but I know</font>

860
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,250
some of the other mobile networks are

861
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:56,050
good at segmenting each individual

862
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,670
device off so you can't talk to other

863
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:05,650
devices yeah it's similar it's similar

864
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:08,800
now don't I know of one that you can't

865
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:13,270
do it over TCP but you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it over</font>

866
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,900
UDP so you can ping people UDP all day

867
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:19,090
long and it shows up and maybe some of

868
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:23,800
the other protocols so they're not

869
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:26,140
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I'd say don't trust don't</font>

870
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,390
trust your wireless provider because who

871
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:30,390
cares that they don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

872
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:37,630
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN that's right make sure it's a</font>

873
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,940
good VPN not like pptp it's just pretty

874
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,710
much almost clear text or easily

875
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,710
reversible password don't do that

876
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:52,329
anybody find any flaws in mobile

877
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:52,328
applications or mobile devices

878
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,840
yep so you're absolutely right about

879
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,780
copying and pasting from inside the

880
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:50,100
encrypted email container outside

881
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:52,800
because if you're still inside that

882
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,930
encrypted email container then you may

883
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,930
have controls on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backend for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

884
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">DLP at the email level so you can't send</font>

885
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,140
things out through the corporate email

886
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,620
account but if you can copy it and paste

887
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,940
into the any of the other email programs

888
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,960
then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> set it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and you</font>

889
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,730
essentially you get around that

890
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,520
corporate DLP and the corporate content

891
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:14,220
control schemes you're also right about

892
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,930
each different version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the app on the</font>

893
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:19,200
different platform has different

894
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,819
security yeah each of the platforms has

895
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,189
a different security model and so you

896
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to program for those and so that's</font>

897
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:28,920
for example why we allow the use on

898
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,900
iPhones but not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android also there's</font>

899
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,630
like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of Android out</font>

900
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:36,600
there Scott did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on I</font>

901
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:38,070
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> waving your magic wand are you</font>

902
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,540
being are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you being the fairy that's</font>

903
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,540
updating all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile apps</font>

904
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,490
because those actually backwards do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

905
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's some other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues traditionally</font>

906
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,870
up until just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently almost all of</font>

907
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,839
them still only had four six characters

908
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:04,310
with no no symbols or containing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brigade</font>

909
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,840
other characters they would actually

910
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent you from doing those for</font>

911
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,490
passwords and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is so scary</font>

912
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,860
numbers so that was actually yours login

913
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,259
account name

914
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:25,500
yep so stock trading apps something to

915
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:26,730
look at that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> point yeah</font>

916
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's different kind of</font>

917
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:30,360
regulations there's there's Security and

918
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,320
Exchange Commission SEC regulations

919
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,180
around stock trading but you're right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

920
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,940
don't think you can reverse those trades

921
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,589
once they're made so if I'm like pumping

922
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,120
and dumping a stock or if I'm like oh

923
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sell this stock to this</font>

924
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,690
other guy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know right I</font>

925
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,880
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how the stock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> market works</font>

926
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:49,530
exactly but I would guess that there

927
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be some pretty serious things that</font>

928
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,580
you can do to somebody's account and on

929
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,400
the back end again right on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

930
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:59,279
level hitting up those those stock

931
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,830
trading<font color="#CCCCCC"> backends to be potentially</font>

932
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,830
pretty pretty dangerous

933
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:14,460
anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a question comment fun</font>

934
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,460
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

935
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay well then Billy you can use my</font>

936
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:27,460
extra 18 minutes I know you'll I know

937
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,460
you'll take full advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

938
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,580
you
