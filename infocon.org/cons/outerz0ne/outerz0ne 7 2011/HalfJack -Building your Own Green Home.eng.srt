okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I wanted to be the</font>

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,070
different top this year because we've

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,799
had computers and you know hacking and

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,059
other stuff and that whoever you know

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,890
almost everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I've been to</font>

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,930
there's something else there's the

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,300
roasting coffee beans or making the

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,680
ak-47 so I said I'll do the different

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,330

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,869
building your own green home but i

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,399
wanted to key in for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience about</font>

12
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:37,469
possibly doing this in hacker space as

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:47,010
well things first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> y'all</font>

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:49,200
broke me<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm there we go okay first of</font>

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,750
all any time doing building<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects or</font>

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,260
tools are involved or small fast-moving

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:58,500
particles nasty chemicals wear eye

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,750
protection okay during my project I have

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">almost lost and I twice ok so I'm</font>

20
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,520
extremely lucky when I was getting you

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,080
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten stitches in my face I thought</font>

22
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:17,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> doctor was my lucky day because he</font>

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:21,090
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eye specialist so so I said</font>

24
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:23,399
you need to wear these all the time when

25
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing anything like okay just as</font>

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,990
a note these are really I shields that

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,479
you pick up safety glasses can take

28
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,949
high-velocity metal objects thrown off

29
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">metales and other types of stuff like</font>

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,110
that the ones you buy at Home Depot can

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,180
so use them within their tolerance range

32
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,590
but you know painting using files

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,579
blowing off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the car for stuff like that</font>

34
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,130
you really ought to have safety glasses

35
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,329
on just take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from somebody that knows</font>

36
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right why green a lot of houses</font>

37
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,869
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being built well not as many now as</font>

00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:01,048
was a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago to in the boom</font>

39
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:03,210
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> green is a big thing okay generally</font>

40
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,380
we think about greening three target

41
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,978
areas helping keeping healthy hopefully

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,989
keeping your wealthy and wise well use

43
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,440
of resources anyway all I times this

44
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,710
goes in

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,980
name of sustainability building things

46
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,590
that don't permanently use up resources

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,130
that nothing can never be built with

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,500
that again the healthy of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,049
focusing in on<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like carpet that</font>

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,930
doesn't out gasps formaldehyde into the

interior environment and pollution

52
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,080
during the production change and stuff

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,530
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> green as far as the wealthy is</font>

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,760
efficient house<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost less to run okay</font>

55
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,750
lower power bills lower heating bills

56
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,299
more comfort as well and sustainability

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">influence it are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kidding me this</font>

green mean that you have to pay a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,700
green well a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times it seems like</font>

or if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch you know DIY TV and home</font>

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,329
and garden a lot of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> other networks</font>

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,870
they're always promoting some green

product no recycled sea glass tiles you

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,050
know fifteen dollars a square foot you

67
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,110
know that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing those things I'm</font>

68
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,630
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a big fan of I think the</font>

69
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,120
green should pay rather than cost that

70
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,549
is you should get a reduction in future

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost for every piece of money that you</font>

72
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,850
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out now rather than sort of a feel</font>

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,260
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm buying recycled and it's not</font>

74
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,930
really making that big a difference in

75
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,700
the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so you know I do four</font>

76
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,510
times the price on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one product where a</font>

77
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,730
low-impact new product is probably as

78
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,609
good or better for the overall

79
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,510
environment and keeps more cash in your

80
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,150
pocket so the saving energy is the big

81
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,060
big thing for green whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

82
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,550
in global warming<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it costs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

83
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,230
to generate power and if you use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

that power you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

every you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what that you don't use</font>

86
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,830
is better for your pocket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font>

87
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,760
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world as a whole why do it</font>

88
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:21,000
yourself well not so much in the healthy

89
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,370
i can say that possibility on the

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">wealthy the wise</font>

91
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,280
after doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm not really sure it's</font>

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:34,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wise to do the DIY then they tell</font>

93
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:39,210
you there may be some some welts

94
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,880
involved in it but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a change</font>

95
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,669
to trade money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for time and that's</font>

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,909
called work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time</font>

97
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,530
and yeah you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself and you</font>

98
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,780
save<font color="#E5E5E5"> money but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font>

99
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:57,000
your time doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we look at to</font>

100
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,489
general choices basically a spectrum

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,530
really of doing it yourself you can be

102
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,560
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own general contractor that means</font>

103
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:08,400
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to coordinate and schedule and</font>

104
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,889
pay and pick up after and take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

105
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,780
the problem is generated by

106
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:14,760
subcontractors this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the people</font>

107
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,448
who pour the foundation who wrecked the

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,150
shell who finished the floors who do the

109
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:24,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">plastered electrical do HVAC that sort</font>

110
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:29,159
of stuff the other thing is you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

111
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:30,690
or all of the work yourself and you

112
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,250
generally you can't do it all by

113
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,840
yourself you'll need friends or hired

114
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">labor of course when you start paying</font>

115
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,520
the labor you start reducing the amount

116
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,930
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saving and if you have a</font>

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,969
project you'll probably have fewer

118
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,090
friends when you finish then when you

119
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,130
started after asking them to come over

120
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and lift heavy things for you on their</font>

121
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,750
spare time where are the savings in this

122
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,030
old DIY process<font color="#E5E5E5"> labour course you're not</font>

123
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,190
going to pay yourself a salary you're

124
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,219
thinking I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend this time</font>

125
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,500
and keep money in my pocket materials

126
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,820
you think well I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send this you</font>

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,349
know if I'm built in the house whether

128
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,419
somebody else did it or whether I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

129
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:12,449
same materials are going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

130
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,729
there actually is a pretty big margin of

131
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:17,400
savings on this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can watch</font>

132
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,750
for sales you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're walking out at</font>

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,270
home depot and they got a big stack of

134
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,210
marble tile there that's seventy percent

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,299
off you want marble tile in your bed in

136
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">their bathroom and you can pick that up</font>

137
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,069
and save some<font color="#E5E5E5"> money the Builder is not</font>

138
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,720
going to be looking out for that kind of

139
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:35,000
deal he's going to go in there and he

140
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,490
have his provider and he'll say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,319
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pallet of Thailand please</font>

142
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,159
deliver it and whatever the price is I

143
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:46,099
pay browsing craigslist finding things

144
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people redoing their own projects a</font>

145

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good materials</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then I've gotten a</font>

146
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,580
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of good deals I've gotten twelve</font>

147
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,770
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars sliding glass door</font>

148

assembly for a hundred bucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

149
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,150
time it took them with move it so there

150
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,580
are deals out there on that and salvage

151
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,549
stores such as the habitat for humanity

152
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,659
or have a catching man to recycle or

153
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,580
whatever they call their zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

154
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:13,430
back to that whether it's wise to do it

155
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself are you really sure you want to</font>

156
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:20,240
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> save money but you will spend</font>

157
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:23,870
time to do that so you know your

158
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,120
weekends evenings vacation time TV time

159
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,190
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you'll feel guilty</font>

160
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,080
that you should be out there building

161
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:33,229
and finishing your project instead of

162
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,979
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know watching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CSI so it really is a</font>

163
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,630
big big commitment there is a general

164
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,818
theory economic theory that you should

165
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,860
do what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good at and pay</font>

166
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:49,069
other people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

167
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:51,889
building to do that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so again a</font>

168
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:55,639
thing to think about for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this crowd</font>

169
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,650
though it is a little bit different

170
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,150
equation because a lot of the things is

171
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,549
you know the hackerspace of hacker

172
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,388
community and if you're looking to

173
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,250
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a space for yourself</font>

174
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,650
doing it yourself as you know the folks

175
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,360
in Nashville and this guy dog and his

176
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,279
folks have you know got a building and

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,259
redid it and have space now for doing

178
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,729
their projects that was sort of the

179
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:19,909
community effort and they were basically

180
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,650
doing himself and if you are doing that

181
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well do it so that it's</font>

182
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,828
green which makes

183
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,199
something more comfortable and have a

184
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,129
lower power bill that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packer you</font>

185
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,709
know group is going to have to pay so

186
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:36,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the loan is is not something</font>

187
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:40,698
i would recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did and i regret it</font>

188
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:44,959
but with a group I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a whole</font>

189
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:47,660
different can you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well yeah you</font>

190
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you may do most all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work on your</font>

191
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,529
home this includes will even dangerous

192
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,750
stuff like electrical and plumbing if it

193
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,550
is your property you can pretty much do

194
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,100
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't go out and do it for other</font>

195
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,529
people without the proper licensing and

196
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,540
this does vary a little bit by

197
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,660
jurisdiction some states and communities

198
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:08,149
a lot more restrictive on that but most

199
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them are pretty open if the owner is</font>

200
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,829
doing work on their own property<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

201
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,899
that's as you may do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the question is</font>

202
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:20,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">can you marry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have the skill set</font>

203
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:23,720
do you want to watch enough you know of

204
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,629
the home shows to see how do I put down

205
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,449
tile or how do I put down floors or how

206
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:33,500
do I you know put on mud on drywall and

207
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:35,719
get it sanded smooth so the the thing

208
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,490
that kills me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that usually when I'm</font>

209
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,069
just getting pretty good at something

210
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,750
I'm done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that project I don't have</font>

211
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:47,110
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tile to put down I don't have</font>

212
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,110
any more training to do etc question

213
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:02,769
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a gray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area I think</font>

214
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:05,440
technically not well if he's a licensed

215
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:08,170
plumber<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be fine but he just</font>

216
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,250
has plumbing skills without the official

217
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,339
you know sanctioned by government bodies

218
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:19,269
is probably if he if he does it but if

219
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:21,579
y'all do it together nobody is there

220
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:25,300
inspecting every time to see who cut

221
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,680
that pipe and glued it up so if somebody

222
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:33,479
has a skill you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly bring them</font>

223
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,479
in and y'all could do it together yes

224
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,770
yes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all along in the project for</font>

225
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,030
any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building whether you're</font>

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,310
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or whether you're paying</font>

somebody to do it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just the</font>

builders doing it you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

229
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,060
the finished product you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

230
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">pay attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to local codes and all the</font>

231
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,359
requirements for you know health and

00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,010
safety basically sewage electrical

233
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,750
plumbing inside the house almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

234
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,200
structural stuff going on it to fall

down<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill the occupants so that sort of</font>

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,660
stuff is is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font>

237
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,270
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the things as far as you</font>

238
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,130
know doing the title of that a ton of

239
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,380
resources on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet as you know</font>

240
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">y'all the interwebs are full of stuff</font>

241
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and some of the videos are actually not</font>

242
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">a cute kittens but of actual you know</font>

243
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you use a soldering gun to</font>

244
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,160
put in a copper pipe or something like

245
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,470
that along hearing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's want</font>

246
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,880
to throw in a quick tip just I didn't

247
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,290
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any place else to put these</font>

248
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,670
and I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of put them</font>

249
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,400
all at one face so I just sprinkle them

250
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:45,490
in here do you talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your local</font>

251
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,650
building officials lipped or five dollar

252
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,830
buildings you pulled it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off on perfect</font>

253
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:53,530
timing they are the ones that you're

254
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,510
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to make happy some of them</font>

255
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,370
are a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more receptive boner</font>

256
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,540
builders some of them are a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

257
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:04,180
more flexible in cutting the codes are

258
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,610
usually very specific but the building

259
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,459
inspector has a lot of leeway or takes a

260
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,060
lot of leeway in whether or not he is

261
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,350
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on signs off on something</font>

262
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,119
electrical outlets the code almost

263
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,890
always says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the grounding plug has</font>

264
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,780
got to be at the top so instead of a

265
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,870
little you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know surprise space on the</font>

266
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,630
wall it's going to be upside down very

267
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,190
few builders put them in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

268
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,280
mostly because most inspectors don't

269
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,990
really give that much attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those</font>

270
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,640
types of things some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do they</font>

271
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,260
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be exactly by the letter so you</font>

272
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,540
need to know which kind you're dealing

273
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you start your product</font>

274
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:44,829
project in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that place and of course you</font>

275
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:46,099
could move you know your location a half

276
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,360
a mile<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a</font>

277
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,440
inspector that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal</font>

278
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,000
with maybe you have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

279
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,490
County inspector rather than the city

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,889
inspector a different city inspector and

281
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:56,540
that can make all the difference ask

282
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:59,329
them a lot of questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do</font>

283
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,610
stuff because you want their take on it

284
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,469
because again you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build to what</font>

285
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,550
they answer is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right way to do it</font>

286
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what they're going to</font>

287
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,819
give you the least trouble on doing it

will cost five times as much to have

encounter many dangerous materials in

thing that you know cost businesses a

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,780
lot of time and effort when they're

387

building stuff but it is also to prevent

388
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,889
deaths because it is quite easy if you

389
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,490
fall a bit on the head you will probably

decision points right the number one

395
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,939
thing detailed plans this is what I left

396
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,679
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I wanted to buy this</font>

ton of resources and waste money and

402
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:25,980
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay houses have multiple systems</font>

403
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:29,460
okay the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure the suit of the shell</font>

406
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go together in one piece if it is if</font>

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a shell you know</font>

408
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,080
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a playhouse for the kids that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

409
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,059
dead simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you wanted to run</font>

410
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,639
some wire around and connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> down some</font>

411
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,428
outlets that is dead simple if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

412
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,559
to put those outlets in those walls it's

413
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,750
five times more complicated because you

414
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,790
have to plan where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> holes where the</font>

415
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,520
wires how to mount them all that sort of

416
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:01,710
thing and again this is what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not</font>

417
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,480
take into account and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

418
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,600
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do things like</font>

419
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,510
cut holes in concrete slabs to get drain

420
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,399
lines through and that can cause a lot

421
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of digging and sawing and sucking in</font>

422
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,790
silica dust which is also a dangerous

423
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,500
chemical that you don't want in your

424
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,030

425
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,140
leave hammers on top of the ladder when

426
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,649
you're up there

427
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:29,040
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> the class also prepares cough guns</font>

428
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:32,280
and pretty much anything heavier than a

00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">pencil</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because later on you'll need</font>

430
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,780
that ladder somewhere else so you yank

431
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,990
it and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> Falls up and if you're</font>

432
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:45,240
lucky it gets you know your shoulder and

433
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:47,360
not your tongue all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um again the</font>

434
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,190
thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done and didn't</font>

435
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,689
start small to build skills<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

436
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,600
think we're currently a small project

437
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,860
it's got a higher overhead because you

438
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,169
know getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concrete truck out</font>

439
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,669
there there's a certain cost just for

440
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that first yard of concrete and it</font>

441
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,240
doesn't you know I'm put that much for

442
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next three yards so I'll for</font>

443
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,440
something three times as big instead of

444
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just big enough for this small project</font>

445
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,720
that don't do the math that way think I

446
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,080
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to practice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I need to test the</font>

447
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,740
waters you can do it with like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cabin</font>

448
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,310
if you already own a home I hesitate to

449
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,370
say do addition because if you if your

450
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,629
plan is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go build your own home you</font>

451
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:36,080
don't want your training<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhibit as part</font>

452
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,280
of the house you're trying to sell so

453
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:46,020
well I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even got to the hazards</font>

454
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,850
of married life but it definitely that

455
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,970
is a major factor if you're in a

456
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:57,899
relationship and you wish to end it

457
00:20:49,970 --> 00:21:01,470
please start to build so a cabin if you

458
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:04,380
have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly family parents</font>

459
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:08,310
maybe they either have land or they have

460
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,020
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit larger lot you</font>

461
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,780
could build likes to the cabin or

462
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:16,830
mother-in-law suite you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

463
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:19,560
mini house or the tiny house movement is

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:23,399
sort of in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing is that very</font>

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,580
very extremely unnecessarily large house

467
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,729
because it sort of

468
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,549
you out of deficiencies to hold my books

469
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,559
and videos and all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

470
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can now store digitally in no space</font>

471
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,860
at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have 800 square foot of the</font>

472
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,370
library space that I could fit on one

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:51,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kendall but with it you know the tiny</font>

474

at again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and efficiency smaller Lots</font>

476
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,939
living in urban environments where you

477
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:02,990
can basically do more of european-style

478
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:06,380
you can walk or bike to the local

479
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,240
resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shops and so forth but</font>

480
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,950
those are those would be a great little

481
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,539
training project and then if you did

482
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,360
need more space you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build another</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">one or adults or the one you got these</font>

484
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,779
would be well I said you can start off

485
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:23,720
with a cabin or I said a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> Playhouse</font>

486
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:25,220
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids and just have that thing</font>

487
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,399
decked out to the nines they'll have

488
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:33,980
tile floors and you know plaster walls

489
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:36,469
and plumbing and electrical and they'll

490
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:39,830
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play house all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way and</font>

491
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,529
you'll build the skills and you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

492
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,199
doing it so much on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the big job</font>

493
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,059
where you get in and realize man I'm

494
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,700
over my head I'm not going to be able to

495
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:53,299
complete this in the 20 days that I need

496
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next person has to come in</font>

497
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:57,049
and do something and of course when

498
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:02,990
we're out of time that's when we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

499
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:05,658
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in spend our money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question yeah yeah</font>

500
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,779
a poker room or a workshop or something

501
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:11,639
like that yes

502
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:16,620
yeah my built my starting projects days

503
00:23:11,639 --> 00:23:18,269
is over the the mother-in-law suite I

504
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,059
don't know people are familiar with out

505
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:24,419
but a lot of cities have ordinances you

506
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:27,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically build another tiny house or</font>

507
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:30,269
very small structure on the same city

508
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,919
lot and the building restriction

509
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:34,409
setbacks and stuff or relaxed and

510
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,970
basically this would be a house for a

511
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:40,860
parent who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is aging but not in firm yet</font>

512
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,710
just to have them you know leave the big

513
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,899
house up north and move down with with

514
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:51,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids but not be in the same house as</font>

515
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:52,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> family to relieve tensions so you</font>

516
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,320
can also help out some other poor fool I

517
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,508
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a self builder and see what it's</font>

518
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,428
like in their life so this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

519
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:01,110
you know I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> karma points would be</font>

520
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,690
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helping out volunteering</font>

521
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:06,120
about somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you would get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

522
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,940
real real life picture what's what to do

523
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:15,949
and what it's like in the long hours and

524
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:18,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">heavy weights that is a pretty good idea</font>

525
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,509
but if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do green building a</font>

526
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:22,830
lot of the habitat stuff is not they're

527
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:24,570
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing some of the skills</font>

528
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,320
that I would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as the green</font>

529
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:31,259
building some some habitat organizations

530
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,450
are but a lot of we're just doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

531
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:34,649
stick building which I don't think is

532
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,259
good enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be considered</font>

533
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:39,479
green in my state building I mean two by

534
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:45,389
four walls fiberglass insulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> wood</font>

535
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:47,580
siding drywall inside so our house

536
00:24:45,389 --> 00:24:51,389
elements we can break<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down into sort</font>

537
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of three extremely simplified areas the</font>

538
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:56,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">Shelf which is basically the outside the</font>

539
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:59,309
interior which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the inside</font>

540
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:06,389
and the systems which would include our

541
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:09,240
electrical plumbing HVAC yeah any type

542
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:11,340
of media system that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do smart</font>

543
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,149
house things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you know pull</font>

544
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,750
networking those types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements on</font>

545
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:21,280
the shell

546
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,750
foundation roof outside walls depending

547
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of that you use these are</font>

548
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,380
the ones that you really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

549
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,800
are going to stand up a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

550
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,940
inside walls are just dividing space but

551
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,440
these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

552
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,880
outside walls are holding up the roof

553
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the foundations got to hold up</font>

554
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,100
everything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we will sort</font>

555
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:42,610
of be looking at all those outside wall

556
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,740
the frame construction is sort of one of

557
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,679
the key points where we'll be making a

558
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,590
differentiation stick building which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

559
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,540
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common issue today some sips</font>

560
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,399
which is when one thing I'm a big fan of

561
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:58,409
I've got a little demo system here we'll

562
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,480
talk about later alternative methods

563
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:05,200
including straw bale paper kraft paper

564
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">creek light straw earthships the</font>

565
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,370
airships are the ones with the tires

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,540
full of dirt in the deserts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> arizona</font>

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:15,550
and tinting of the aluminum hand walls

568
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,129
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know basically using them as bricks</font>

569
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:21,340
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mud and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between units or thing lots</font>

570
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,520
of different alternatives surprisingly

571
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,679
the building codes are fairly adaptable

572
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,879
only a lot of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are covered</font>

573
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,960
by building codes and they say this is

574
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way that you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do them so more</font>

575
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,700
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shell and that's not the unit</font>

576
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,540
shell and things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just show the house</font>

577
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,980
yeah this is where you sort of want to

578
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,570
put the money and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort because</font>

579
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,460
this is this is the dividing line

580
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,040
between the outside and inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

581
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,930
is where you will get your most the

582
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,260
biggest gains on your efficiency<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

583
00:26:52,930 --> 00:27:00,010
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is one of the the</font>

584
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,950
big payoffs it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that common but it</font>

585
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:06,760
is a big big big jump forward as far as

586
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:10,090
strength and efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> insulation</font>

587
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,270
efficiency on the home so I set up talk

588
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,310
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just having</font>

589
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,720
reflective roots if you go down the

590
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,310
interstate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look out a new</font>

591
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">subdivision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the little McMansions</font>

592
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:24,070
all of them have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray black type of</font>

593
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,470
roots because that's what people like to

594
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,720
their house to look like right that

595
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,130
drives up their<font color="#E5E5E5"> power bill is short</font>

596
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,780
the life of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that roof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

597
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,280
destruction underneath it and we were

598
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,470
just paint them white or use white

599
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,520
shingles it would save a tremendous

600
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:41,530
amount on the heating load for that home

601
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,139
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you can</font>

602
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">research on the internet and find you</font>

603
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,230
know if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the little tricks</font>

604
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:57,699
together you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get some big</font>

605
00:27:47,230 --> 00:28:01,059
games yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but actually it's</font>

606
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:04,419
hard to actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore it's</font>

607
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,950
very heavy it's it's you would think

608
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:07,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're so heavy the Hurricanes</font>

609
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,679
wouldn't move them but a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of times</font>

610
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,799
you got to do extra stuff to hold them

611
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:13,570
down and what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have today is</font>

612
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,918
basically fiberglass ones so most of if

613
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,980
you see in the installation that looks

614
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that tile it's probably fiberglass</font>

615
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,480
panels you know overlapping panels that

616
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:24,190
just looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and those those</font>

617
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,110
panels are fine they can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you</font>

618
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,200
know light colors and again reflect the

619
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:31,928
sun's heat just as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> regular</font>

620
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">shingles or something like that metal</font>

621
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:36,820
roofing standing seam metal roofing is

622
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:40,330
one of the you can get the you know the

623
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,129
shiny galvalume or other shaded ones but

624
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,710
the lighter the color<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better it's</font>

625
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,470
going to kick the heat out and keep the

626
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">Attic cooler which keeps the interior</font>

627
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:54,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">toward windows and doors there's a big</font>

628
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,620
price differential<font color="#E5E5E5"> on windows and doors</font>

629
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:59,500
some of the most expensive or what they

630
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,090
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the low E and I don't know some</font>

631
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,230
special way your place to draw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

632
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:07,000
but it means emissions or maybe somebody

633
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,330
knows but basically it means resistance

634
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,500
to having heat come through it and

635
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:17,049
triple pains and argon field and exotic

636
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,299
gases inside there you know gold coating

637
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:22,210
on the interior<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it will do a lot of</font>

638
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">things as far as making that piece of</font>

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">glass which normally he runs right on</font>

640
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:30,039
through bounce the heat back and they

641
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,710
are considerably more expensive than

642
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,220
just regular double pane you know vinyl

643
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:39,179
clad windows and you have to look at

644
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,120
whether or not they make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

645
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:45,400
different climates

646
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,830
different climates different heating

647
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,990
requirements exposure you know which

648
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,850
side of the house its own are those

649
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,100
another didn't put it on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a</font>

650
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,740
little trick about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting around the</font>

651
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,360
fact that you've got a greatly insulated

652
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,280
wall and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got basically a big</font>

653
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,260
hole in the wall with some glass over

654
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:05,010
that killed you know the average of

655
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,629
those is a pretty low insulated factor

656
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,400
insulated shutters that you can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

657
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,770
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different temperature</font>

658
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,840
differential is big or even you know

659
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">just some of the window dressings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

660
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,949
have heavy thick drapes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will block</font>

661
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,390
the heat going through things so a lot

662
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,040
of little tricks we can apply there a

663
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:28,030
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things things we will have to</font>

664
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,710
look is the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it going to you know</font>

665
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,510
be reasonable for our environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

666
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself back in a time before it needs to</font>

667
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:41,379
be replaced<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright another little quick</font>

668
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,929
trick a drywall scaffold this is one of

669
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,780
useful tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ever got to hold up</font>

670
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:49,450
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little deck raises and</font>

671
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,220
lowers and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to be up tall</font>

672
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,110
you can raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up there and use the</font>

673
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,330
sizes ladder you can drop it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down low</font>

674
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,939
and put a bunch of materials on it and

675
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,710
roll it around to where you need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

676
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,480
can put it at desk height and have a

677
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,850
work table and usually you can find

678
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,610
these you know used on craigslist<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

679
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,010
about 100 bucks need for 200 bucks but

680
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,500
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

681
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,570
really couldn't hardly do without

682
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:18,130
because it's so useful being you know

683
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,929
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tight ends on wheels now talked</font>

684
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,360
about our exterior we had you know

685
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:25,590
different things that we can do to the

686
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,719
roof to the outside on the interior

687
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:33,280
innovation we have floor ceiling and the

688
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,860
walls to deal with and we have various

689
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,560
products there a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> products</font>

690
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:42,159
here are ones that I think they're

691
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:44,560
they're like green washed they claim to

692
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:49,930
be some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of recycled material but at</font>

693
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:51,970
some ridiculous cost to that the you

694
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,970
know regular old tile various types of

695
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ceramic and porcelain and stuff</font>

00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,400
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheat looks good fairly easy to</font>

697
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,639
actually put down if you want to do the

698
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,160
work on your knees all that time the

699
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,280
laminate and hardwood floors lots of new

700
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,860
vinyl products the linoleum true

701
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,590
linoleum instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vinyl which is what</font>

702
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,409
a lot of times people call a vital cog

703
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,970
linoleum it's coming back and a lot of

704
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,860
the linoleum products are very very

705
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,820
pleasant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

706
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,870
natural products they're not really

707
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:29,040
petrochemical based like the vinyl stuff

708
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:30,570
us so got a lot of choices<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're green</font>

709
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,850
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice I didn't list carpet on</font>

710
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,909
there I am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I don't like carpet</font>

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:39,060
and that may just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a personal thing</font>

712
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:40,440
the thing on carpet is that it did

713
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,889
pretty much is always a petrochemical

714
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,750
base product unless again you do a green

715
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:49,050
product made out of natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> fibers and</font>

716
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:53,040
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten times more expensive and good</font>

717
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:56,510
regular carpet but I would rather have

718
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">well placed you know running rugs or</font>

719
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:03,030
spot rugs for it of course I put down

720
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,600
radiant heat so my floors will be warm

721
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:08,370
and will warn my house where if you

722
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,929
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know having cold</font>

723
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kyle through everywhere especially in</font>

724
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:22,740
the bathroom is maybe not something that

725
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:26,310
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be yes yes yes well if you</font>

726
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,500
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like laminate or solid</font>

727
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:30,300
hardwoods a lot of those will pretty

728
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,200
much all of those come pre finish now so

729
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,990
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much about</font>

730
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,180
the finishes but a lot of the laminates

731
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,530
they have a compressed wood component

732
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,560
and a lot of those from contain

733
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:42,510
formaldehyde so that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

734
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,520
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the formaldehyde outgassing and</font>

735
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,740
one of the things about an efficient

736
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,050
house is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's tight it doesn't let air</font>

737
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,060
just you know go willy-nilly it keeps

738
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,820
the warm air that you have inside and

739
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,770
cold air outside and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that warm air is</font>

740
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,230
getting contaminated with with stuff we

741
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,360
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at having a ventilating</font>

742
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,870
systems that replace the air with fresh

743
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,149
air

744
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,559
once a while and you know do some inner

745
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,300
to do some research on the internet and

746
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:14,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up really good and confused</font>

747
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:16,710
after that surprisingly the kind of

748
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,649
thing what they call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lows</font>

749
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,720
brands that's primer and paint in one

750
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:24,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they advertise it like crazy on TV</font>

751
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,638
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> has very good ratings as far as</font>

752
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,659
low VOCs so these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten</font>

753
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the public and business</font>

754
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,330
consciousness a lot and so it's pretty

755
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to find big box store products that</font>

756
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:39,690
are meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good requirements where</font>

757
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,370
before you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did the</font>

758
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,330
cheapest thing and sold it but now they

759
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,790
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's one of the things</font>

760
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,739
they advertise is this is a low<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLC</font>

761
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,050
typified and plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places that you</font>

762
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:51,000
can go check<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those types of things</font>

763
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,550
each of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems the paint the floor</font>

764
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,800
or the junior check and see you know

765
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,350
some agency or some organization has

766
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,410
rated them as to how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

767
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:05,610
environmentally or how chemically

768
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:08,580
sensitive people would respond to it so

769
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:12,780
we got like said other choices a lot of

770
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:16,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">these you know we have to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of make a</font>

771
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,330
payoff on on time and effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can</font>

772
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:21,690
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you can hire people to do</font>

773
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:24,450
drywall anywhere anytime it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

774
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,880
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out there doing it if you</font>

775
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,680
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself that's</font>

776
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,150
that's the big projects one ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

777
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,770
probably if you doing regular drywall

778
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">which seems I wouldn't recommend</font>

779
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,330
attractive yourself but then you know

780
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,340
the drop ceilings where they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

781
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,680
dropped in here but most offices have

<font color="#CCCCCC">drop ceiling and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have those at</font>

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the house have places to run your cat</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole other</font>

system that you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

788
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:57,210
do the research find out how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

789
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:59,370
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it square and the walls list</font>

790
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,900
most walls drywall but you can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

791
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:05,779
handling different types of hardwood

792
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,400
plaster which plaster is a wet wall

793
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,050
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you smear a plaster and it</font>

794
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,660
hardens on there versus the drywall

795
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,850
which

796
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:16,870
the panels are just muddied at the seams

797
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:18,850
and then going over now you mix it up a

798
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:21,730
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times I've taken four products</font>

799
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,890
and use those as either countertops or

800
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,470
wall coverings if I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small section</font>

801
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,540
like in a bathroom a small short wall I

802
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,049
put laminate flooring on that looks

803
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">great the depending on type saying vinyl</font>

804
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:38,380
them different types of sheet products

805
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,460
that go on the floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can glue them</font>

806
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:44,470
to the wall and they work very well

807
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,500
there are the for bait panels the wood

808
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:49,330
siding that's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to the paint</font>

809
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,490
and keep painting every few years if you

810
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,230
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on outside if you put those</font>

811
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,870
suckers on the inside instead of drywall

812
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,520
you can hang a picture anywhere you want

813
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,930
to because that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-quarter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inch</font>

814
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,150
product you can put a screw in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

815
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,710
one to hold up a heavy mirror whatever

816
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,780
and it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little</font>

817
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:07,210
bit rustic if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're looking</font>

818
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,950
for that type of thing but you know just

819
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it says it's built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exterior</font>

820
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,060
doesn't mean it can't go inside reverse

821
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,730
is not true this belfry inside you

822
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,970
probably don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it up soon</font>

823
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:21,430
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> look quick tip use a tool card</font>

824
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I would probably be finished like</font>

825
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:25,960
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a half years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if i didn't</font>

826
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:31,480
spend half of my time looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

827
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:34,390
tool that I just had I use it it

828
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,910
disappears and I need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and so I</font>

829
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:40,299
walk around to all the places I was and

830
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,799
so finally I said all right i want to

831
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,320
put all my tools on card on the city

832
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,820
there so when i do mindlessly because

833
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steps sat</font>

837
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,370
work here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then work there and you</font>

838
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,899
can just roll stuff around and right now

839
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,549
since all the schools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> universities</font>

840
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,700
the places are getting rid of the big

841

TVs<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the big CRT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TVs then they have in</font>

know I go by well you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy a</font>

sales department at big-box stores homes

857
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,960
and home depot and lowes both have you

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">know things where if you're going to buy</font>

862
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:01,100
their contractors sales especially now

863
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,590
since building is is slacked off so much

864
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,130
so if you get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contract or credit</font>

865
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:09,500
card they want they want you to put

866
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:14,360
charges on their credit card so they're

867
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:16,340
talking discounts on that if you long

868
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,800
time you think well I go to the plumbing

869
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,540
supply store because you know they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

870
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,150
all the time they buy in bulk they'll

871
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,820
have the best price surprisingly lot of

872
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:28,550
times that's not true they are

873
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:31,360
structured as contractor or

874
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:34,250
subcontractor service which means that

875
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,070
the subcontractor doesn't care what the

876
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:39,530
pay's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cost plus if it costs</font>

877
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,360
ten dollars they get paid ten dollars by

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Builder and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their feet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if it</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">costs twenty dollars they get paid</font>

880
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:47,120
twenty dollars plus they're fit so they

881
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:50,090
don't shop for price on these places

882
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,400
they value return easy return and you

883
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:55,880
know delivery policies and stuff like

884
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,790
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I've had price difference</font>

885
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,490
differences of two hundred percent

886
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:05,240
between a big box store and a specialty

887
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:09,229
you know store for conduit and wire and

888
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:12,080
things like that I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get</font>

889
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,020
three bids or three quotes put the name

00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:18,049
you know the numbers for the local

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,450
Building Supply places in your phone and

892
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:21,830
if you need something call all three and

893
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,080
ass they're used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answering that</font>

894
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:27,920
question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it cost and</font>

895
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,759
they'll be happy to do that the you know

896
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,680
this pays off just as the

897
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,330
specialty stores are not always cheaper

898
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,830
the big box stores<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not always to</font>

free their specially on things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort</font>

901
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:45,069
differences on a property<font color="#CCCCCC"> no a product</font>

903
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:50,260
forty dollars on exactly the same roll

of wire and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I paid</font>

905
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,110
unfortunately one hundred forty dollars

906
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,590
because I saw home depot will be cheaper

907
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they definitely were in this case so</font>

00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:01,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system's energy efficient systems</font>

909
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,819
cost more the refrigerator that you go

910
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:06,730
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bigger the rating</font>

911
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:08,950
or the lower the cost for yearly cost of

912
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:11,560
electricity the bigger the price tag on

913
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:13,569
same thing applies to water heaters and

air<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditioner and stuff like that it</font>

915
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,550
is often a lot more two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three times</font>

00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,290
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient versus the</font>

918
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:23,860
the plain old was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy-efficient</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so it's always</font>

920
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,620
improving willies the key is what's the

921
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,870
payback if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

922
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,850
twice as much but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will get every</font>

923
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,560
penny of that back within two and a half

924
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,290
years because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower energy costs</font>

925
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,720
that's a pretty good deal if it costs

926
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:42,370
twice as much and you're only going to

927
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,439
save eight dollars a month because of

928
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:48,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> price of electricity and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you</font>

in the hole from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you do have to</font>

932
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:57,819
sort of calculate a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,740
places climate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the energy costs are</font>

934
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,910
a big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> when trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

935
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,410
what it is of course you can go online

936
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,279
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of calculators that</font>

937
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,279
will help you find us

938
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:12,160
yeah yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're lucky there will be</font>

939
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,099
rebates either from your your power

940
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,230
provider the city state county federal

941
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:20,589
government taxing of energy credits were

942
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,560
a big thing ended last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm afraid</font>

943
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:25,660
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could you know you spend five</font>

944
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,240
thousand dollars on<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy-efficient</font>

945
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,490
windows appliances and you get 15

946
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,919
hundred dollars of that back as a tax

947
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,959
credit so you came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to your pocket</font>

948
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,300
so basically you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> two big chunk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

949
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,760
money that way some states are a lot

950
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,290
better than that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

951
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,170
through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of solar systems which I</font>

952
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,150
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mention solar a lot of</font>

953
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,790
systems you could get a federal rebate

954
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:50,619
and then a lot of states Adam and a lot

955
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,240
of CDs have them Florida was especially

956
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:54,040
good about that although it was so

957
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular they ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of money and the</font>

958
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,540
government still governor certainly not

959
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:59,950
going to allocate any more for it but I

960
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean it could reduce the cost of a</font>

961
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:06,910
system by forty five percent a lot of

962
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:10,660
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still there but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not as</font>

963
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:12,160
generous as they were if you're the

964
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,589
thing about going solar that's one of

965
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,390
the big systems most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

966
00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:19,900
electronic panels you know the

967
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:21,730
photoelectric panels in hot water the

968
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,910
technology on hot water the solar hot

969
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:28,180
water heaters well developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

970
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:29,770
good rebates payback<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the five to</font>

971
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,940
six year range you're definitely

972
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,079
probably if you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

973
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,960
definitely probably should but we're

974
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for space heating unless you're</font>

975
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to pipe the hot water through</font>

976
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,010
radiant heat to do it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of</font>

977
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,319
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta really look at the system</font>

978
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:47,069
and look at your position you know trees

979
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,930
around the house and things like that

980
00:43:47,069 --> 00:43:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">your photoelectric that is generating</font>

981
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:56,710
the electricity maybe I kind of think

982
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,078
the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

983
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,760
better within five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the price</font>

984
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:05,380
is going to go down a lot in five years

985
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,480
so you still<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean still a fairly good</font>

986
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,690
deal most places have a pretty

987
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,190
reasonable payback on that but I'm

988
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,660
holding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a little while I think it's</font>

989
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,759
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better in the future</font>

990
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,199
so I may be wrong on that

991
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:19,989
thinking but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people ask about</font>

992
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:21,489

00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:33,069
out the hurricane you know knocks down

on power lines the tsunami you know

998

washes away all the telephone poles that

are holding electrode lines your system

unless it got specifically damaged you

1001
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:45,578
still can run the refrigerator and have

1002
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:48,269
lights on so a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like</font>

best way to go batteries expenses a lot

1006

of trouble most places have net metering

1007
00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:58,959
so any power that you generate excess

1008
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,078
you can sell it<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the power</font>

company at that rate and then pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,339
back out of the grid later when the sun

goes down so again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to check your</font>

drop something if you can set it down

and break something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you look</font>

1080
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,420
at three places along the wall so you

1081
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:28,420
run wires through and drop them out they

1082
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:31,269
are routed out so that when we have a

1083
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,880
foundation we set this down on the board

1084
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:34,308
this bowl

1085
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:37,670
to my foundation and we err nail it

1086
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:41,809
about a hundred times you know on that

1087

is any time where the foam<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

1093
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:05,558
these panels as will see the minute come

1094
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:07,640
in big pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so super kick</font>

1095
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,509
they're very very efficient they don't

1096
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,828
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that break of wood along the place</font>

1099
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:21,740
bachelor straw here I'm put into a wall

1100
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,049
11<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago and I had when I pulled it</font>

1101
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,089
out yesterday it looked and smelled just

1102
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:29,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">as sweet as it lost when I went in there</font>

1103
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:31,400
so strong is a super installation

1104
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:34,819
product because it's got a lot of

1105
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,650
hearing and spat so that's something you

1106
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:39,558
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little money in a lot of time I</font>

1107
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:42,519
can say strawberry like do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another</font>

1108
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:44,569
recommendation is laminate energy

00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:48,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineer floors these things go down</font>

1110
00:49:44,569 --> 00:49:51,288
fast and look great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

1111
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:53,539
things that I would say if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1112
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it do it with these these cysts</font>

1113
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:57,759

1114
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,759
stronger things

1115

1119
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:27,869
that enclosed 48 x 24 space so i think

1120
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:30,130
that's 2,000 something feet yeah

1121
