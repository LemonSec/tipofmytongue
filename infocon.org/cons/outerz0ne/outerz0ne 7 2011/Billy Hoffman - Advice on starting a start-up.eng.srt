really<font color="#E5E5E5"> come here to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about really</font>

40
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">what our new startup does it basically</font>

41
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is a web performance but it's not</font>

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,709
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lame type of web</font>

43
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,899
performance like load testing basically

44
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,880
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked in the security space I</font>

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,350
managed a research team that built

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,480
products is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> would scan your</font>

47
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,310
website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find security issues and the</font>

48
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,899
company i worked at now build software

49
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,120
which scans your website and find

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,530
performance issues and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,390
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would love to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to anybody</font>

52
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,489
here who's got websites or web apps and

53
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,570
wants to make them faster but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

54
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:32,830
really what I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about</font>

55
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,900
what I want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you about is</font>

56
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,180
everything I've learned in the last year

57
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:41,530
I'm starting a start-up because before I

58
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,850
when I got out of college at Georgia

59
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,459
Tech I went to work first start up here

60
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Atlanta spy dynamics and it ruins me</font>

61
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,420
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an amazing experience and</font>

62
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,040
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never want to work for a large</font>

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,510
corporation I will gladly sell zoom

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
through a large corporation stay there

65
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,380
correct is it two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and then leave</font>

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,260
but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could ever work for</font>

67
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,959
a large corporation again and the thing

68
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it has never been cheaper to start a</font>

69
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">start-up especially a technology startup</font>

70
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,810
software specifically hardware less so

71
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,160
when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about just how I mean</font>

72
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">things imagine you were trying to start</font>

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,209
a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the turn of the 20th</font>

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">century as opposed to the 21st century</font>

75
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">right like how how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get by</font>

76
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,810
I mean you had to either I mean they

77
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,809
didn't even have business loans at banks

78
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,070
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was your rich uncle the the amount of</font>

79
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,810
Labor you would need the type of

80
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,910
equipment facilities everything

81
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,950
ridiculous now online it has never been

82
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,200
cheaper to start a start-up anybody's

83
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,160
interested you know I highly suggest you

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,988
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learn too much</font>

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable stuff here read anything</font>

86
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,610
that Paul Graham has written founders at

87
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,829
work is a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> book really all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

88
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,720
stuff will give you some<font color="#CCCCCC"> really great</font>

89
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:48,310
advice really I'm just want to tell you

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,420
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what I've learned in the last</font>

91
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,280
year

92
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,319
and the thing that I've learned is that

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,390
startups are very hard for hackers

94
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,369
because a lot of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that make</font>

95
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,679
you awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a hacker will make you</font>

96
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,440
horrible at starting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup I know</font>

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,300
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible at it and I'm not</font>

98
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">even good at it now but I learned a lot</font>

99
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,390
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hard way and that's</font>

100
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,860
because hackers love technical things

101
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,899
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the technical</font>

102
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,880
aspects of stuff you also want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

103
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,470
elegant right you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

104
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,298
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> press Mike was just</font>

105
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,488
saying about stuck next<font color="#E5E5E5"> right not only</font>

106
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">was it cool hack it was a sexy hack</font>

107
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,150
because it was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> chain of Eau de to</font>

108
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,440
chain of outdated chain of Eau de I mean

109
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,539
who build something that hacks

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,210
everything from windows 95 up to the

111
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,220
present that's just sexy and awesome but

112
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,388
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that take when you're</font>

113
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,919
doing a start-up you don't necessarily

114
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,080
have time to make stuff that's

115
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,880
technically elegant or sexy if you do

116
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,260
it'll be two years down the road you

117
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,969
will burn through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your funding and</font>

118
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,520
competitors will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already come into</font>

119
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,570
your marketplace and<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it and you're</font>

120
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,190
screwed exactly you're an al and I are

121
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,020
having a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation out in the</font>

122
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,850
in the hall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you when you</font>

123
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,859
start a business you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a business to</font>

124
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,990
make money you incidentally make

125
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,460
software that's what makes you money but

126
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,479
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really your you don't have a</font>

127
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,419
software business you have a business

128
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,810
that makes software oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did you I need</font>

129
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:06,400
to drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more of this um the other</font>

130
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,050
problem with hackers is that we want

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,789
complete solutions we want technically

132
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,370
elegant complete solutions that solve a

133
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:14,140
problem completely or we want a series

134
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,240
of small you know she'll scripts that

135
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,650
can give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complete solution but</font>

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you are not going to have time for</font>

137
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,580
a complete solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will really get</font>

138
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,400
into this but these are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

139
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,979
kind of make things difficult for you

140
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,690
also as a hacker and I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I</font>

141
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:30,729
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> guilty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this even ever after</font>

142
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,080
moving from an individual contributor to

143
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:34,599
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a manager of individual</font>

144
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,490
contributors is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am i happiest when I</font>

145
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,320
can take three days and dig down into

146
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,910
the guts of something and deep dive and

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,409
figure out everything how it works I

148
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">even like to say i'm not really a</font>

149
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,039
security guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just like to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

150
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,930
how stuff works and in the process of

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,490
figuring out how stuff works<font color="#E5E5E5"> i figure</font>

152
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,770
out the flaws<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font>

153
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,840
of a side benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having figured out</font>

154
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,010
how it works when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're starting to</font>

155
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">start up and you're running a business</font>

156
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:59,020
you don't have time you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

157
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,420
breath instead of debt and so that's

158
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,820
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

159
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,170
also it's it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

160
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's like Field of Dreams right if</font>

161
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,320
I build it they will come no they don't

162
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,960
know you exist they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never come and</font>

163
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will die eating ramen noodles so you</font>

164
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">just because you built some technology</font>

165
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,460
that was awesome that is not a business

166
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is technology and so it's this this</font>

167
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,049
makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult for to shift</font>

168
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,600
gears from being kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a hacky tech</font>

169
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,350
geeky guy to actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a</font>

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">start-up so axiom number one first thing</font>

171
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to get through your brain if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

172
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,120
want to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a start-up is your time is</font>

173
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,650
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most valuable thing you have there</font>

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,480
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important than how you</font>

175
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,880
spend your time I cannot stress this

176
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,650
enough and so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really good</font>

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,060
examples of this you have to understand

178
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,679
your time is money and you need to

179
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,630
actually put a dollar value on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

180
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,210
time is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you make 50 grand a year</font>

181
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,350
you earn twenty-five dollars an hour you

182
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,620
were in two<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand dollar you know</font>

183
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,300
there's 52 weeks in a year you get two

184
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,190
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> vacation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's 50 weeks you</font>

185
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,540
work 40 hour weeks which by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you</font>

186
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,520
will not work<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 hour weeks is a</font>

187
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,680
start-up but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use that to</font>

188
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,690
suppose yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> every oh absolutely full</font>

189
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,520
benefits everything that's 50 grand a

190
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,920
year is twenty-five dollars an hour 100

191
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,590
grand a year is fifty dollars an hour

192
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,360
now you know I've left HP and I'm I have

193
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,609
no problem telling folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I left HP</font>

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
is a manager I was making about 120 a

195
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,610
year so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting fifty dollars an</font>

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,830
hour and consultants when they bill out

197
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,800
they bill out at about a hundred and two

198
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,150
or 100 to 300 dollars an hour now that's

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you're not building out 2,000</font>

200
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,940
hours a year necessarily so you need to

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,290
start realizing that your time is money

202
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,050
great example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is if you have a</font>

203
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,400
task that takes you one hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> a month</font>

204
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,100
that cost you six hundred dollars a year

205
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,169
to do that task so if you could pay

206
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,580
somebody to do it for you and it's less

207
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,860
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> six hundred dollars you need to do</font>

208
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care what the task is you</font>

209
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,210
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care how much you enjoy</font>

210
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing it you you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't sustain it</font>

211
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,719
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend your time great</font>

212
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:59,700
example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is server administration</font>

213
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,290
email administration will get to this

214
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,000
later but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you'll</font>

215
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,290
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do again you want to get in the</font>

216
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeds you want to get down in the guts</font>

217
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it awesome you just can't</font>

218
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,780
afford it because you're you're wasting

219
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,490
time that you could be billing clients

220
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,239
or trying to build your business so just

221
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,440
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

222
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,479
whenever you have something you need to

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,460
work on being like how much is this

224
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,810
costing me a year to do and how much

225
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,229
would it cost me to pay somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to</font>

226
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,720
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so time management is</font>

227
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,960
a key here startups are all about breath

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,630
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular day I have mountains</font>

229
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,598
of all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little but usually time</font>

230
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,049
critical tasks so and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a flaw of</font>

231
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,610
mine I put off stuff I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

232
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:40,169
the problem is is that when you're in a

233
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,610
start-up mode you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these little</font>

234
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,929
things you're like I'll do that the end

235
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,490
of day I'll do that after lunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

236
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,319
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that tomorrow morning first</font>

237
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,180
thing you normally can't put this

238
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,860
off and so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time in my</font>

239
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,689
evenings I'm up to like I'll you know

240
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,000
work till about seven eat dinner and

241
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,279
then after dinner it's my here's all the

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get done it's stuff I</font>

243
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know mostly email mo but it'll be</font>

244
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,750
things like filling out quotes sending

245
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,459
out you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that so it's all</font>

246
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,709
this crap you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to do but</font>

247
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,339
you've got to do it and making that

248
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:13,109
switch is difficult the thing is is that

249
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,390
by focusing on breath and set debt you

250
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,640
make progress on all of them actually

251
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah a method i've been using probably</font>

252
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,089
the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very helpful is</font>

253
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,410
the egg timer method I'm sure there's

254
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,000
probably a better way of doing that but

255
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll make a list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

256
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff I got to get done that day and</font>

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,740
then I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> an egg timer so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like 4</font>

258
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,540
30 minutes I'm going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Zoom</font>

259
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,450
finances I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know update</font>

260
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,279
the forecasts on what sales prospects we

261
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,740
have coming in what were my expenses

262
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,270
this month all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after 30</font>

263
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,250
minutes when the little egg timer goes

264
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,870
off even if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done with expenses I</font>

265
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much get to the stopping point</font>

266
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,040
spend a minute or two wrapping it up and

267
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,350
I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next task because it is so</font>

268
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,910
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a rat hole right like</font>

269
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,529
who here when you're writing software or

270
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,939
working on task you look up and you're

271
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,209
like holy it's ten o'clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> at night</font>

272
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,160
how did that happen you you can't afford

273
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that as a start-up because it's</font>

274
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,540
like holy crap like great examples i'm

275
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,969
working with a big travel website that's

276

based in australia so if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

296
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,210

298
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,570
or five people that had you know

299
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,980
contacted me through sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> were saying</font>

300
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,090
you know they filled out our form on our

301
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,580
website saying they're interested

302
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,590
learning more about the product I had to

303
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,800
do I'd to fix a couple bugs in the

304
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">product and I needed to do actually some</font>

305
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,880
security consulting I did the security

306
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,740
consulting last actually I did the

307
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,060
security consulting and then I didn't

308
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">even have time to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fixing the bugs</font>

309
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,630
in the products if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> if only i had</font>

310
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash available cash to hire sales</font>

311
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,360
engineer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> beam I see I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got I've</font>

312
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,730
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work out my time to balance that</font>

313
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,310
so you gotta prioritize because you you

314
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,320
absolutely cannot afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down a</font>

315
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">rat's hole because the money you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

316
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,880
saved up goes really fast that's the

317
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,800
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about running a start-up now</font>

318
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,410
because it's so cheap to run a<font color="#CCCCCC"> start-up</font>

319
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,910
you don't have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cash</font>

320
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,400
flow will talk about this later cash

321
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,469
flow is a big problem because let's say

322
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,689
somebody owes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand dollars if</font>

323
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">they pay me on the if they decide to pay</font>

324
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,510
me on the fifteenth of the month instead

325
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,189
of the first of the month that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

326
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,990
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal because I don't have like you</font>

327
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,480
know 20 grand sitting in account

328
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,790
somewhere so that I can like absorb and

329
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,740
expand with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow right like you're</font>

330
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,140
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lean you don't have that</font>

331
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,210
type of ability so you you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

332
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritize and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you're</font>

333
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing stuff that's going to give you the</font>

334
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">fuel to keep going and they call this</font>

335
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like your burn rate and stuff like that</font>

336
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:21,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">but just continue to remember that the</font>

337
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,790
cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your time so again outsource</font>

338
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,620
delegate and accept less than perfect

339
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,120
and all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things are very</font>

340
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,860
difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hacker to do because was</font>

341
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,990
hacker do wordpress that's a piece of

342
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to write my own CMS no no</font>

343
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,500
someone who broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a web app</font>

344
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,089
professionally please tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> what CMS</font>

345
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,410
your writing and hopefully it's in PHP

346
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,140
and I will have a field day with

347
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,390
it don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have time for</font>

348
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> except less than perfect move on we</font>

349
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually our website got hacked I</font>

350
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:49,580
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> funny somebody</font>

351
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,040
popped us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to update our</font>

352
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,480
WordPress and yeah we got hacked and i

353
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,949
laughed and i took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half a day and i</font>

354
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,230
cleaned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but you know what half a</font>

355
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,470
day of cleaning up<font color="#E5E5E5"> wordpress over a 14</font>

356
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,839
month stretch was way cheaper than me

357
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,339
evaluating 15 different CMS's and then

358
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,750
deciding which one was the most secure

359
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,430
and then you know making my own

360
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,170
improvements and then managing it and

361
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,370
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that crap you know what which in</font>

362
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,050
fact what I probably could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done is</font>

363
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,850
just paid somebody and say here's my

364
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:19,849
backup here's my theme restore my

365
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:21,800
wordpress site exactly it's easier to

366
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,250
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgiveness than well as permission</font>

367
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,290
that's cheaper yes cheaper here do so

368
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,750
just remember outsource delegate<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept</font>

369
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,579
less than perfect so axiom number two

370
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,529
other than time management is that

371
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,370
incorporation is protection and

372
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:39,439
incorporation means separation so you

373
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,910
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to incorporate if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

374
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">start a start-up and the reason you do</font>

375
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,270
this is because it creates a separate

376
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,450
legal entity give you a great example I

377
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:49,670
true story know somebody who does<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

378
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,579
run a small boutique security consulting

379
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,380
shop or rather they did because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

380
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,529
were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security assessment and</font>

381
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,839
they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a bank website like newt</font>

382
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">newt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the account database they had to go</font>

383
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,089
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the nightly backup and</font>

384
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,979
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not have an LLC did not</font>

385
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:08,810
have anything thanks to the out of

386
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">them for taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down their website for a</font>

387
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">24 hour period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they look bad with</font>

388
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,290
customers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they did not have</font>

389
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">a legal entity instead of suing thump</font>

390
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,029
incorporated they sued Billy often it

391
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,040
wasn't me it was you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> them instead</font>

392
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,829
of suing you know generic pen testing

393
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,560
company LLC they sued you know pen

394
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:30,800
tester man they took his house they took

395
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,040
his pension he's

396
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,109
it's not funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's he has his</font>

397
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,540
wages garnished for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

398
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,190
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cleaners and he should</font>

399
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,050
this is why you incorporate

400
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,690
incorporation creates a sekrit legal

401
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,750
entity anything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do as a legal</font>

402
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:53,899
entity but within limits there's you

403
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:55,610
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font>

404
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:57,470
gross negligence and things like that it

405
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,300
doesn't totally protect you but

406
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,820
basically anything that you can do a

407
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,319
corporation<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do and so they are suing</font>

408
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,089
the corporation for being negligent not

409
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,220
you they garnish the corporation's

410
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,630
assets they<font color="#CCCCCC"> tank the corporation they</font>

411
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,010
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust you personally they don't</font>

412
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,570
touch your family<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't touch your</font>

413
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,850
life savings<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't touch your house</font>

414
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,800
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it the</font>

415
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,720
thing is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not difficult it sounds</font>

416
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">scary but it's not there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

417
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">types of corporations there's a limited</font>

575
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,770
thing is so other documents you know

576
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,789
like non-disclosure stuff like that I've

577

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with the company they're</font>

like yeah um what's your non disclosure

579
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,610
or you know mutual confidentiality

580

agreement whatever i'm like i don't know

581

we're flexible we typically use whatever

582

the client asks look I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

583
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,360
mutual non-disclosure agreement so

they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's what we got I'm</font>

00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,670
kind of acquire this stuff or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,560
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find it it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you think it sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

594
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,510
intimidating right like this is checking

it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty easy you'll spend</font>

598
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,440
probably two days just acquiring all

company setting up your business

601
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,800
checking account all that stuff is not

602

yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your that's the other thing to point</font>

611
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,490
sounds silly but it's critical it

612
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,409
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do but at any</font>

613
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,940
point in time you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

614
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,920
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> these questions how much money do</font>

615
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,200
I have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much money have I</font>

616
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,880
invested either i personally put into

617
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,830
this like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wrote a check to bootstrap</font>

the company or i took<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other people</font>

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,090
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is sales brought in not</font>

620
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">only in total over the life of the</font>

621
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,600
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in the last month how much</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">money is coming in how much money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have I</font>

623
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,490
burned on expenses that were capital

624
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,860
expenses like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought a server and so</font>

625
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,770
arguably if the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> died tomorrow I</font>

626
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,229
have intellect capital basically have an

627
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,170
asset that i could sell and recoup some

628
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,460
of that cash and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay off investors what</font>

629
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,320
are your monthly expenses how much money

630
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,460
do you burn a month right now my monthly

631
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,139
expense rate is like 30 to 75 and a

632
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,870
significant portion of that is my

633
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:48,480
mortgage the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is money that</font>

634
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">i pay to contractors and subcontractors</font>

635
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,660
and then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's actually a</font>

636
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,950
ridiculously low burn rate

637
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,190
it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

638
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,080
think about that in so thirty two

639
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,240
hundred dollars a month you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 12</font>

640
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,220
months a year that's not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font>

641
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run a company it really isn't just</font>

642
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,790
start out and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if I made</font>

643
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:20,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost me 150 grams are</font>

644
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:22,810
running a year I'm pedaling no I want

645
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:29,409
I'm not I'm paying my mortgage i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

646
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">paying myself do you like that oh that's</font>

647
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,300
true too well you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you want to</font>

648
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,649
make sure well that's the thing that's

649
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,210
why it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be transparent that's</font>

650
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,890
why you want to track it you want to be

651
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,100
able to say like right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

652
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,350
you well it's on a truecrypt drive but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

653
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,820
could show you every single expense that

654
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,469
zooms every single amount of money I've

655
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,060
ever spent every single amount of money

656
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,730
I've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken in every single sale and</font>

657
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,379
the key here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your runway your runway</font>

658
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:56,020
is how much money do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on hand</font>

659
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:57,520
forget about sales that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not closed</font>

660
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,350
yet because that is not money you have

661
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,180
that is money you might have if the

662
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,300
sales fairies decide that you should

663
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,280
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and as we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about sales you</font>

664
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:10,690
realize sales fairies are in fact very

665
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,730
real um so you know you it's what is my

666
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,710
what money do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> on hand what is my</font>

667
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,210
monthly burn rates and that's how long

668
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,040
your runway is so if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 grand</font>

669
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,020
and you're you're burning two grand a

670
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,170
month you've got five months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in five</font>

671
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,030
months you have no money so<font color="#CCCCCC"> at month for</font>

672
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you better start looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a job so</font>

673
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you need to know that right and the</font>

674
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,160
thing is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're running a start-up</font>

675
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,790
you're really lean so your runway is

676
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,650
probably only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple months out cash</font>

677
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,409
flow we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this early cash</font>

678
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,090
flow is is it's not so much like you

679
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:43,030
could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this and say huh in the</font>

680
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,919
month of January I I sold five thousand

681
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,720
dollars worth of software and I paid out

682
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,510
six thousand dollars in contracts and

683
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,860
expenses all right maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pay I earn</font>

684
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:52,870
five thousand dollars and I paid out by

685
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,899
thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great at you know</font>

686
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">January 31st your net is zero but when</font>

687
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,770
did that come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co</font>

688
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,139
out did you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1000 of that in the</font>

689
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,300
first week and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000 of it in the</font>

690
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,980
last week but then you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

691
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,480
your expenses in the middle or your

692
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,429
 because you were negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

693
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,289
little while

694
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,029
and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interest of negative</font>

695
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,799
which music your negative thing yeah you

696
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually went farther into the hole so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and when you're a startup you are really</font>

00:25:16,529 --> 00:25:21,509
lean right like you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

699
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,789
float to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to absorb that stuff so</font>

700
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:25,379
use a spreadsheet what I actually do is

701
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,119
so I've got two spreadsheets I've got

702
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:29,428
one that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

703
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,320
expenses and sales and stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

704
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:32,850
have stuff that actually is on like a I

705
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,009
break it down per month<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like</font>

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,779
when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pay a bill and when is an</font>

00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:38,490
invoice coming in and jae'nt like the

708
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,499
first of every month I sit down and I

709
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,779
say what money is coming in this month

710
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:44,490
what days is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it coming in what money is</font>

711

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:50,190
never have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> temporary negative the</font>

713
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,230
other value here to have is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh when</font>

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do work or when if somebody does</font>

716
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,110
and we get an invoice from the design

717
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,409
company you normally get to pay those

718

invoices in 30 days sometimes 40 days 60

719
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:05,490
days when you're a startup take

720
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,110
advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's like I've got</font>

write you that check now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the funny thing</font>

726

people do that to you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> box</font>

advantage of the linea see and what's

731
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:33,480

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,139
okay its eyes a professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and grossly</font>

747
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:08,639
negligent and do something horrifically

748
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:10,229
bad that and I take something down that

749
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:11,248
I have insurance to cover that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

750
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,720
they'll be like you have to carry a

751
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:15,330
million dollars worth of errors and

752
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,859
omissions insurance which<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

753
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:19,769
bad it cost you about nine hundred

754
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:21,250
dollars a month to carry that and at the

755
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we're just like</font>

756
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,660
can't we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not an expense</font>

757
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,670
we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying some of this</font>

758
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,290
mainly is in consulting<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime I mean</font>

759
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously you're doing sales consulting</font>

760
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,770
or marketing consulting and you're not

761
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,670
actually touching their assets you don't

762
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,680
have to worry about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a</font>

763
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,570
security contractor even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> got sure I</font>

764
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,430
guarantee your firm has errors and

765
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,230
omissions insurance in fact even if

766
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,280
those guys actually know that that

767
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:49,720
wouldn't have saved them because you

768
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:56,710
really can't oh is that what I'm not

769
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:58,270
familiarity you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right but the</font>

770
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:16,270
chance of zoom killing somebody is

771
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:17,950
pretty small right like oh ok ok so see

772
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,510
right now we have you know a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

773
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,860
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of employees but would probably</font>

774
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,870
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice for us to eventually carry that</font>

775
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,729
but it's a good example right and what

776
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">what so actually this is kind of a funny</font>

777
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,150
story and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make me run longer</font>

778
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,430
but when i first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started at spy there</font>

779
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:32,680
was this um<font color="#E5E5E5"> indian security researcher</font>

780
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:34,000
their name tambay and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> he got hired</font>

781

784
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,020
tma goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok well what happens if I don't</font>

785
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,459

786
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,590
do I get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> money back and she's like</font>

787
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,420
that's not how insurance works you just

788
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,949
by Eddie's like I remember you got so

nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens I don't get it back it's</font>

792
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,040
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if you've got it back it</font>

793
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,960
wouldn't really be insurance right they

794
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,850
just pay out what happens and then

795
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,430
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take anybody in that's not</font>

796
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,620
really a sustainable business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model the</font>

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hicks evidence the savings account so</font>

798
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:10,149
yeah so insurance is there to protect

799
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you for when crap happens and you will</font>

800
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:15,100
want it so that you are not catastrophic

isn't that large but that doesn't really

851
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,510
matter and the big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is it</font>

852

postpones the initial capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs yeah</font>

853
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:20,860
after two years will we have basically

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,159
upgrade that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on something faster</font>

00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:49,149
amazing business opportunity and asked

prime<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of something that you yes</font>

914
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,110
you could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yourself and if you've</font>

915
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,519
invested the time and effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> and set up</font>

916
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,229
like a centralized server and whatever

919
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,629
scratch you would be stupid not to do

920
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,769
this I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously remember I you</font>

921
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:08,199
would probably spend an hour a month

928
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,119
separating the corporate from your

929
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,040
entity your corporation should ideally

930
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,069
have its own telephone number so that

931
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:30,489

936
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,639
separate cell makes a lot of sense we

937
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,348
don't do this personally we use google

938
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,419
voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk about that second but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

942
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,530
know if it's ringing it's a customer and

943
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,099
they just answer it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their business</font>

944
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,099
stuff yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> buh</font>

950
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:34,089
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> drinks that way all right so google</font>

951
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,828
voice is freaking amazing so google

952
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:38,200
voice will give you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> free telephone</font>

953
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,299
number and they also make basically

954
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,368
google voice is a number that you then

955
00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:44,440
in google voice tell it where you want

956
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:46,960
it to forward so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a google voice</font>

957
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,119
number for zoom in between like eight

958
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,579
and six Atlanta time it forwards to my

959
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,980
cell phone now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is when I</font>

960
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:56,650
see it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know let's say</font>

961
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,839
strick calls my google voice number I've

962
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,369
got strict as a contact so i don't see

963
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,650
strict calling me what appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> what my</font>

964
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">color ID is the google voice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number so i</font>

965
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:09,369
know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a customer answer it zoom</font>

966
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,450
not was up i'm drunk so awesome and the

967
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,619
other cool thing is that it has

968
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:13,750
voicemail so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like between</font>

969
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight and six don't ring anything just</font>

970
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,319
go straight to<font color="#E5E5E5"> voicemail and you can</font>

971
00:36:15,279 --> 00:36:19,450
record your own voice mail message now

972
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,910
the only downside about this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

973
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:24,848
it routes the number to your cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

974
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:26,589
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't pick up it uses your cell</font>

975
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:29,410
phone's voicemail with the cell phone

976
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">voicemail message so that can kind of be</font>

977
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,629
a problem if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already on a</font>

978
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:37,058
business call I'm sorry you can but the

979
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,609
problem is is that basically google

980
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:42,730
voice takes over your voicemail on your

981
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:44,078
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you only have your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google</font>

982
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">voice mail but so people who would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

983
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:51,150
be calling my number directly would get

984
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:51,150
my google voice answering machine yes

985
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,260
exactly you've got to manage it but so

986
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,240
it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky but a great alternative</font>

987
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,280
I really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this idea of just</font>

988
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,200
grabbing a cell phone because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

989
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,490
ever have to call people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it right you</font>

990
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,750
can just call from your cell phone be

991
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,279
like oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling it from my cell but</font>

992
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,960
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way of I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's</font>

993
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,540
prepaid if you don't use it it doesn't

994
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,700
die and if it's ringing you know it's a

995
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,620
business account and prepaid cell phones

996
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,730

bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small businesses that use this</font>

greetings and crap like that and it's

1012
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,620
it's not ten cents a minute it's cheaper

1013
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,240
than that but I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> used the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

to you can print it sign it scan it send

1019
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,610
it back kind of a pain in the ass but

1020
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know there's there's no need for</font>

1021
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so it's really easy in terms of</font>

1022
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,120
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need a lot</font>

go ahead and share your desktop but that

1027
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,440
only works really if you're calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1028
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,870
single person or there's a bunch of

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in a conference room we used to</font>

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,200
month and you could do unlimited

1032
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:42,390
meetings with unlimited participants but

1033
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,859
zoom's product is web-based SAS so a lot

1034

1036
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,049
like walk you through it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because we</font>

1037

1041
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:59,760
can basically create on on the flight

1042
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,410
chat rooms with webcams and it just uses

1043
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,560
flash so there's not like that

1044
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,270
installing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to meeting or you</font>

1050
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,250

1051
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:23,250
you go there start broadcasting it's

1052

great which one is that teamviewer com I

1053

1054
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:38,789
corporate use<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's right so</font>

1055
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:40,500
your website<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you really would be</font>

1056
00:39:38,789 --> 00:39:43,259
stupid to do this yourself like you can

1057
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,029
host so we have our basically our

1058
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:47,279
product runs in the Rackspace cloud it

1059
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:48,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">stands and people log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into our site but</font>

1060
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:51,359
there's customer data on that so we

1061
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:53,819
don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run our corporate website</font>

1062
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,890
on that same system I mean we could but

1063
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:57,869
you know we're paying like you know

1064
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:59,129
absolutely basic hosting is less than

1065
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a month why you can get hosting for</font>

1066
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,150
like three dollars a month and they'll

1067
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,619
give you a hosted WordPress installation

1068
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,630
you know there are lots of themes lots

1069
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,039
of plugins actually it's kind of cool

1070
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,410
because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the performance</font>

1071
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:12,150
problems we find on web sites there are

1072
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,740
wordpress plugins that will solve them

1073
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,539
for you so it's kind of cool because

1074
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,189
it's you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people quickly</font>

1075
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:19,109
speed up their sites based on the CMS

1076
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,730
they're using but don't run your own

1077
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">website don't don't try to keep up with</font>

1078
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:27,599
a patching<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apache which that sounds kind</font>

1079
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,519
of cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know don't don't try to do</font>

1080
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,289
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if you if you have system</font>

1081
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,519
administrator experience and you like

1082
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:34,529
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're already</font>

1083
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:39,078
having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because your product</font>

1084
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:39,079
demands you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's fine but</font>

1085
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,339
yeah that's somebody that was those you

1086
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:50,099
know host gators problem not mine so

1087
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,630
well first<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all lames just say like as</font>

1088
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,670
funny as<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being if you ever get a</font>

1089
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,170
problem Oh we'll just sue them to your

1090
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,730
already you've lost if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1091
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:59,849
brought lawyers into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you've already</font>

1092
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:02,069
lost so that's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a viable like</font>

1093
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:03,720
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you want to avoid the</font>

1094
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:05,670
lawyers ever having to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1095
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,359
we have a plausible strategy for when

1096
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,980
the lawyers get involved so don't don't

1097
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,670
try to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yourself seriously don't</font>

1098
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,289
it's it's can be a huge pain in the butt

1099
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,119
it's too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again remember if you spend</font>

1100
00:41:16,289 --> 00:41:19,999
an hour

1101
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,940
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred dollars a year so just just</font>

1102
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:25,160
pay somebody to do it messaging so this

1103
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:27,230
is chi<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cannot get this cross and I'll</font>

1104
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,940
never until I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to HP did I even her</font>

1105
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,589
messaging being used as a verb like<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1106
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,859
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> message this correctly and it</font>

1107
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:36,680
kind of pissed me<font color="#CCCCCC"> off but messaging is</font>

1108
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:39,799
all about succinctly expressing what it

1109
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,710
is you do in understanding how you

1110
00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:45,109
should express that so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that it</font>

1111
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:49,339
most successfully appeals to your

1112
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:50,808
customers you could don't build software

1113
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,920
to help website owners fine and fix

1114
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:57,950
performance problems are slowing down

1115
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,450
their website no<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's not it's</font>

1116
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,189
more than the elevator pitch the

1117
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,680
elevator pitch is I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stepped into</font>

1118
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:06,230
the elevator with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark Horowitz and/or</font>

Marc Andreessen or Ben Horowitz from

1120
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:11,119
andreessen horowitz and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I've</font>

1121
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,220
got you know two floors to get them to

1122
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,769
like me pretty pretty please<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you like</font>

1123
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:21,499
me yes no circle here exactly so what

1124
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:24,169
problems do you solve what why what are

1125
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:25,999
the alternatives and and why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1126
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,710
better so okay yeah there's this problem

1127
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you solve it do I care about this</font>

1128
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,319
product first of all you should answer

1129
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,180
these questions before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to</font>

1130
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,710
start a start-up right because you got

1131
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,629
to know whether it makes sense for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1132
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,549
to do this so when I was looking when

1133
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,019
I'm doing web site security I found it

1134
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:41,239
was like holy<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap you are hacked to</font>

1135
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:42,769
hell and gone but not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that like</font>

1136
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,690
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> website's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just really crappy like</font>

1137
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:47,598
it's fundamentally broken some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

1138
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,190
like your CSS files<font color="#CCCCCC"> are returning 500 so</font>

1139
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,859
your site isn't even rendering properly

1140
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:56,900
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found one site actually I'll tell you</font>

1141
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:59,569
this h HP com right now the in some of

1142
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,970
their style sheets have executed on

1143
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:04,579
either ASP or JSP code I can't tell

1144
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,589
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just using a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no less</font>

1145
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:08,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">than sign % you know and then like</font>

1146
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:12,499
equals some you know variable name so

1147
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:15,619
they have on of course I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care</font>

1148
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:17,419
they're not exploitable so it's but a

1149
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,519
great example of it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

1150
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,069
misconfigured website right it's it's

1151
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,189
not even

1152
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:24,719
working properly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1153
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:27,119
these performance problems with it too

1154
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,190
and so I'm like well wait a minute these

1155
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">perform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems are over the place so I</font>

1156
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,940
know these problems exist why aren't

1157
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,709
they being solved is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

1158
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,779
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about them but don't care or is it</font>

1159
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them or is</font>

1160
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:40,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the cost isn't that big of a</font>

1161
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:42,180
deal so I had to go find these things

1162
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,680
out so you should answer these questions

1163
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,940
long before you start the<font color="#E5E5E5"> startup</font>

1164
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,739
because this basically determines

1165
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:54,239
whether it makes sense is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a need</font>

1166
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:56,609
yeah it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem so in the</font>

1167
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,920
web performance space it's it is a

1168
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:00,209
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did not realize that they</font>

1169
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,069
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know they had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems</font>

1170
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:03,690
they're like wait what it's not what

1171
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:05,670
we're seriously and then we'd be like

1172
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,079
your you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your web server is</font>

1173
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">not configured with compression you're</font>

1174
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,859
loading 18 JavaScript files and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1175
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:12,209
page takes 22 seconds to load and by

1176
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:16,019
making<font color="#E5E5E5"> these changes your page will load</font>

1177
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:18,390
in seven seconds they're like wait what

1178
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:20,758
now set you you can make our site load

1179
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:22,920
more than twice as fast more like yeah

1180
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:25,049
and they're like and who do I write the

1181
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,219
check to and I'm like you ready to zoom

1182
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:29,719
because you don't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> me you pay the</font>

1183
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:29,719
corporation<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the corporation pays me</font>

1184
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:45,940
exactly the challenge here is that you

1185
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,040
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what's called missionary</font>

1186
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,150
sales and don't don't go to a dirty

1187
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,550
place with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it means that you have</font>

1188
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go and convert the heathens basically</font>

1189
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,570
you're having to explain look like what

1190
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,220
is front end performance optimization I

1191
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:59,230
already do load testing why do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

1192
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:01,480
do what you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you explain no here</font>

1193
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:03,130
here's what the problem is here's your

1194
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,750
the things you already have here's why

1195
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,490
they don't solve that problem here's

1196
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,260
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is costing you and</font>

1197
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,640
here's how we fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem better</font>

1198
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,190
than anybody else who can fix that

1199
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,870
problem and but it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

1200
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:15,670
having answers to these who do you

1201
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,290
appeal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody in IT operations</font>

1202
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,060
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy your solution or is</font>

1203
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,770
somebody in the QA market going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

1204
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,390
your solution or somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the dev</font>

1205
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,040
department going to buy your solution

1206
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,200
that's going to change how you

1207
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,700
communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them right like what is</font>

1208
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,770
important to them what so if you're

1209
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,089
selling to the developer community your

1210
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:36,700
point is is that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

1211
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:38,670
faster for them to write code yeah we'll

1212
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,189
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in sales but you have</font>

1213
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:44,260
user buyers economic buyers and

1214
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,150
basically compliance by people who have

1215
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,710
to check Mars that's we're getting it

1216
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,930
that's that's fairly advanced but

1217
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,340
understand messaging now the thing is is

1218
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,379
that I thought I was pretty succinct

1219
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,660
about this we did a huge website

1220
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,160
redesign in November we actually paid

1221
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,950
somebody to come in and write the copy

1222
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,029
for the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like I can do this</font>

1223
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,399
Tracy my friend who's helping me<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1224
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:04,900
she's like no no you can't you can get

1225
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,070
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at conferences and drink early drinks</font>

1226
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,810
and talk for a long period of time but

1227
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:11,710
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't write for and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1228
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:16,960
okay thank you good to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1229
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:18,640
that's a lie so basically i paid

1230
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,670
somebody to come in and he interviewed

1231
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,379
me for probably two days like tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1232
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:24,910
about what your product does why he

1233
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,170
asked all of these questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> right like</font>

1234
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:28,330
explained to me and we basically

1235
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:30,160
narrowed it down to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are</font>

1236
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:32,170
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three things that that would</font>

1237
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,430
really resonate with your target market

1238
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,870
you know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make your job</font>

1239
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,490
easier why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make your</font>

1240
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:40,330
job easier you're sowing into the QA

1241
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:42,549
space do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let them test the you know</font>

1242
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:44,110
the holistic applic the holistic

1243
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,300
application faster you give them the

1244
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:48,190
coverage they need so it's understanding

1245
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,549
who your audience is what their pain

1246
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,049
points

1247
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:51,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">are how do you speak to the language</font>

1248
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:53,859
this can be difficult and getting it

1249
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:56,199
right is crucial because you want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1250
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:57,549
be sexy rob was telling me like our old

1251
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,719
website looked like crap and then he's

1252
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:00,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">like wow I looked at your new website</font>

1253
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,509
and it's like very clean and

1254
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:02,979
professional looking and that

1255
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:05,170
professionalism is what you want to

1256
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:07,749
convey and so getting your messaging

1257
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,999
down is key you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it yourself but</font>

1258
00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:13,269
just when you're crafting it you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1259
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:16,058
have answers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these questions um so</font>

1260
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:17,738
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with this logo talk about</font>

1261
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:18,910
logo<font color="#CCCCCC"> ll yes it's a turtle but it's a</font>

1262
00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:23,619
turtle going fast he's got little

1263
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:27,670
goggles and he's smiling right true it

1264
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:29,829
does it there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i well I'm sorry you</font>

1265
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:31,179
don't like a logo there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1266
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:34,229
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so think about</font>

1267
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:37,059
think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nike swoosh think about</font>

1268
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:40,058
its blaming turtle yes so think about

1269
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:42,519
the Nike swoosh think about like the

1270
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:44,349
PepsiCo logo or even something like the

1271
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:46,508
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wildlife Fund which is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Panda</font>

1272
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:50,739
they're fairly simple they're they're

1273
00:47:46,509 --> 00:47:53,199
easily recognizable this is too complex

1274
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:54,759
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to print this think</font>

1275
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:56,559
about printing this on a t-shirt no

1276
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:57,670
problem printing this on a pen that's

1277
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to blur together you're not going</font>

1278
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,259
to be able to see stuff yeah these two

1279
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,428
turtles are together this is busy it has

1280
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:08,109
a lie will beat you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the face it's got</font>

1281
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:09,999
you know two different types of greens

1282
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:12,519
and you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1283
00:48:09,999 --> 00:48:16,509
right and it's got a name and this so

1284
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:18,008
it's a busy logo um how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it don't want</font>

1285
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:19,929
to make them too complex think about

1286
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:22,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">size will it look big won't look small</font>

1287
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:23,829
think about colors right if this is

1288
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,869
black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> white will you still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

1289
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to tell what it is what about white on</font>

1290
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:30,309
black there's what's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> for color</font>

1291
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:31,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">printing where it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually you</font>

1296
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:43,299
local we came up with was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and the</font>

1297
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,529

00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:36,780
that so seriously have them everywhere

1398
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:39,710
and I literally mean everywhere that's

1399
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,330
right I did all right axiom number three

1400
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:44,580
only your customers can tell you what

1401
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:47,310
you want Rob Rob is going to start

1402
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:49,380
laughing here but when you work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1403
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,299
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and product management is like I</font>

1404
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,620
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're like did</font>

1405
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,090
you talk to customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like</font>

1406
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:56,460
shut up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not your concern it's</font>

1407
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:58,410
like you're you're just making up

1408
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,480
aren't you write like you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1409
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,890
what they want only your customers can

1410
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,130
tell you what you want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to build</font>

1411
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what they need so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to get</font>

1412
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:09,210
whatever it is you're building in front

1413
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a customer ASAP this is what's called</font>

1414
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:15,210
a minimally Viable Product you'll see

1415
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,220
MVP this title used a lot with startups

1416
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:21,800
we do this product management taking

1417
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:24,149
their job until you see you tell them

1418
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,680
sure of course that gets back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the who</font>

1419
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:31,530
your audience is were you selling this

1420
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:32,609
do absolutely yeah you can't you can't

1421
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,940
bolt them if you didn't give them

1422
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:38,580
direction right but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time you</font>

1423
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:40,380
you it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what they think</font>

1424
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:42,240
the product should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it's not what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1425
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,800
like maybe you and I can argue about

1426
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">whose opinion matters more and maybe</font>

1427
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,770
yours matters a little more than mine

1428
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,330
and maybe my experience matters a little

1429
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,560
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you when i was at HP we have</font>

1430
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,060
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversations all the time and</font>

1431
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,980
then when I was like Puckett I'm leaving

1432
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,540
I didn't care and I literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet was</font>

1433
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,790
like your opinion your opinion

1434
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,740
 my opinion what matters is the

1435
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer's opinion and nobody's talking</font>

1436
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:07,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer so you need to talk to</font>

1437
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:07,220
the customer yeah yeah

1438
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:14,890
absolutely yes so that's the thing get

1439
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,390
their feedback and actually track the

1440
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,098
feedback so this was the other thing is

1441
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i worked as a research manager</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1442
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:20,890
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> product management would come to me</font>

1443
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:23,319
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we need to focus on these things</font>

1444
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:24,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'd be like who wants those so that as i</font>

1445
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:25,900
build them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them and make</font>

1446
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:28,118
sure i'm building what they want he's

1447
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,229
like I can't tell you that that is the

1448
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,720
worst answer you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever hear</font>

1449
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:33,819
because anybody who is ever building

1450
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,979
anything needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a spreadsheet and</font>

1451
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:37,509
that lists every single feedback they've

1452
00:54:35,979 --> 00:54:39,939
gotten from a customer ever basically

1453
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:41,890
all right these<font color="#E5E5E5"> three customers want</font>

1454
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,359
this feature because you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

1455
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:45,038
to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be like ha you know what</font>

1456
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">those three customers want that those</font>

1457
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,539
three customers represent forty percent

1458
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:51,999
of my sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to make them happy</font>

1459
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:54,369
and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to rank that above doing</font>

1460
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:55,538
this feature that these seven guys want

1461
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:57,190
because those seven guys pay me a

1462
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,720
hundred dollars a month which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nothing</font>

1463
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,279
whereas these guys pay me a thousand

1464
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,140
dollars a month you need to be able to

1465
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:04,539
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> those decisions again this sounds</font>

1466
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,160
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple and it's not difficult to do</font>

1467
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:07,809
but it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

1468
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,670
to maintain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get an email you go</font>

1469
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:11,470
an update so you all start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see those</font>

1470
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,539
little tasks that I was telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1471
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:16,118
about their time<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical that you have</font>

1472
00:55:13,539 --> 00:55:17,799
to do you don't really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but</font>

1473
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:19,809
are absolutely critical for you to run

1474
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:22,029
your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> because think of it like</font>

1475
00:55:19,809 --> 00:55:23,650
you are gathering data from a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1476
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:24,999
sensors and if you are not gathering

1477
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,170
that data you can't act appropriately

1478
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:30,209
because you don't know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell's</font>

1479
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on do you have another question</font>

1480
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:35,920
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably commercial tools i</font>

1481
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:38,319
just use a spreadsheet I mean we we we

1482
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a lot of customers and what</font>

1483
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:42,819
we do use is user voice calm this is

1484
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,009
awesome so basically there's a little

1485
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:46,058
widget I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I've internet</font>

1486
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,289
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I'd show you but have you</font>

1487
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:49,660
all ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the little red</font>

1488
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:51,190
feedback that says a tab that says

1489
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,890
feedback on the side of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website or a</font>

1490
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:55,359
product we're a web-based SAS so that

1491
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody can be like hey this</font>

1492
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,710
page is confusing feedback I don't

1493
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,259
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this means or what you</font>

1494
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:04,359
know there why is there an export or<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

1495
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,829
here why<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it only text or csv like and</font>

1496
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:08,920
instantly it'll track it and the cool

1497
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:11,650
thing is as other people can vote and

1498
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:13,509
say yes I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too and because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1499
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,369
coming from zoom we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't I</font>

1500
00:56:13,509 --> 00:56:18,039
based on their username who ordered it

1501
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:19,749
so we do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have some software</font>

1502
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:21,460
there but ultimately I just take<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1503
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:22,149
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an email whenever somebody</font>

1504
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,410
does that

1505
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:29,079
and then I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the email into the</font>

1506
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Excel spreadsheet yeah exactly you want</font>

1507
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:33,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand</font>

1508
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">what is out there now the other thing is</font>

1509
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:38,170
is everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't be a slave to this</font>

1510
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,490
right there's a famous quote that said

1511
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,260
if Henry Ford listened to his customers

1512
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:43,629
he would have been selling buggy whips

1513
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,039
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars and because sometimes</font>

1514
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,720
people don't know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want Apple</font>

1515
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,339
has this problem all the time he you

1516
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,538
know if they had followed what customers

1517
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:51,609
wanted with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tablet they would have</font>

1518
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:53,140
made a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you</font>

1519
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:55,359
all have thought of tablets for the last

1520
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,788
eight years<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know sir you would</font>

1521
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:01,359
have with some crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> stylus thing and a</font>

1522
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:02,950
really crappy version of XP yes so like

1523
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,109
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that you can't</font>

1524
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,879
always listen to them but when you're

1525
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:08,440
starting out and you're you're really

1526
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,599
kind of exploring this market like you

1527
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,299
were no Steve Jobs not Steve jump none

1528
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:16,900
of us are Steve Jobs yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font>

1529
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:18,339

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this in front of customers get</font>

1531
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:21,578
their feedback iterate and that's the

1532
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:22,960
other great thing iterate as quickly as

1533
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:25,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing about</font>

1534
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,579
being a SAS is that we find a bug and we

bit of pleasure out of it well that

1591
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,760
would be back but also so lower the

1592
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,049
barriers of entry of getting this into

1593

1598
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:44,300
poor even poorly<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-action</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is better</font>

1599
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,010
than we can see because you don't have

1600
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,440
time to wait and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a perfect</font>

1601
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:51,200
example is this slide used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1602

1603
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,169
always fix it everything later and so

1604
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:59,720
sure enough yes I wasn't able to fix it

1605
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:01,760
later so now it's awesome so seriously

1606
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,540
this gets back to that don't don't worry

1607
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,580
don't like I have a social

1608
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,920
cases like a customers like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this</font>

1609
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:09,270
feature and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> like okay I don't</font>

1610
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,180
want to write that oh look there's

1611
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,220
imagemagick awesome and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I literally in</font>

1612
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:17,220
our code I've written code to basically

1613
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:19,109
shell out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to imagemagick do something</font>

1614
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,359
capture the result that come back and

1615
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,800
use it and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following</font>

1616
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,350
open-source licenses we put you know

1617
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,090

1621
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply just a technology great example so</font>

1622
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,000
when we started the company i actually

1623
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">created an S corp instead of a c-corp</font>

1624
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,540
the reason we decide to end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a</font>

1625
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,370
c-corp is it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little easier once you</font>

1626
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:46,470
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting rounds of venture capital</font>

1627
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,720
to to do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1628
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:50,220
created an escort bubble oh crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do</font>

1629
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,870
i do I now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this legal entity and</font>

1630
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:54,209
it's the wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing no problem lawyers</font>

1631
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:57,180
can solve everything it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

1632
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:58,860
done fixed it later six months down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1633
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,180
road we took her friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> family</font>

1634
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,400
around we were able to change stuff so

1635
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:03,930
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always fix it later if you try</font>

1636
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">to say I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this perfect</font>

1637
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:07,500
I need no you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time get it in</font>

1638
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,210
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers get people using it</font>

1639
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,560
validate that somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay you</font>

1640
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:15,450
money to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing and move on</font>

1641
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,549
pricing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I cannot stress this</font>

1642
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:20,100
enough pricing you will almost always

1643
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:22,170
under pressure products because like I

1644
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,819
looked at this and I'm like has anyone

1645
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever has anybody here ever worked on</font>

1646
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:27,210
enterprise software or sold enterprise

1647
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:29,670
software built it right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worked on a</font>

1648
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:31,320
security product that we sold entry even

1649
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,080
like with discount it was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

1650
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:36,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight thousand dollars per user per year</font>

1651
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty eight thousand dollars it's a</font>

1652
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,040
ridiculous amount of money right like

1653
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,570
that's that's absurd to me you know

1654
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,130
until you buy a house and then you

1655
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,720
realize it's actually not that much but

1656
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:47,130
I mean when you think about software

1657
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,149
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like when you're writing it</font>

1658
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,890
you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone paying twenty</font>

1659
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:53,640
thousand dollars a year for this thing

1660
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:56,129
there's there's a big jump between what

1661
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,210
people will be expecting to pay for like

1662
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">winzip and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people pay for</font>

1663
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:01,710
enterprise software the key to do this

1664
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:04,080
is that understand what are you

1665
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,760
replacing so the cool thing we do is

1666
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,350
jump is we've automated a lot of

1667
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do manually so we're</font>

1668
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:11,460
freeing up time and have to buy are you

1669
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:13,140
freeing up someone's time so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

1670
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,240
more efficient we<font color="#CCCCCC"> build jump as an</font>

1671
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,609
efficiency tool we're reducing the

1672
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,890
amount

1673
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:19,180
time your guys need to test it and we're

01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:23,339
unique needs yeah

1702
01:03:40,339 --> 01:03:45,779
hmm the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that like I'm</font>

1703
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:48,390
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to say this without</font>

1704
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:50,730
sounding like an asshole but I think I

1705
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:52,230
know websites really really well and so

1706
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:54,480
I bring a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of expertise into how</font>

1707
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:56,369
websites work how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact and how to</font>

1708
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,869
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them faster and so that's even</font>

1709
01:03:56,369 --> 01:04:00,150
though I suck at starting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start-up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1710
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:02,609
I'm good at making software that

1711
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:04,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyzes websites and so and that's also</font>

1712
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:06,660
really good so here's the other thing

1713
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:08,460
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have ever like are in</font>

1714
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:11,310
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> t or ever bought like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1715
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,740
product like a firewall right<font color="#E5E5E5"> well no</font>

1716
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:15,720
not a lot so if you're in purchasing or

1717
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:18,029
whatever at a corporation you might by

1718
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:20,040
firewalls once like you might decide who

1719
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:22,320
your firewall vendor is once twice if

1720
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:24,210
the first guy it up right like

1721
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't you don't go and buy it's not</font>

1722
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:27,810
like the seasonal it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like oh let</font>

1723
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:29,520
me go read vogue and find out which

1724
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:31,500
firewall is in season this year right

1725
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,210
like you just have a firewall and so

1726
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,220
when you're starting a company you're

1727
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:37,410
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a relationship with</font>

1728
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,149
someone and so you're not selling it's

1729
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like i'm selling you winzip and</font>

1730
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,660
you're like does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it do feature XY and Z</font>

1731
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:45,119
and if the answer is no I don't want to

1732
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:48,359
buy you a lot of it is who you're buying

1733
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,980
it from hey guys I'm sorry I'm gonna go

1734
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:52,710
quick but it's it's hard for me to

1735
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,810
concentrate with all the noise so you

1736
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:56,460
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember that you are selling in</font>

1737
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,529
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways yourself as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well because</font>

1738
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,030
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not buying product one point oh</font>

1739
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,230
they're buying product one point 0

1740
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:02,130
through eight point<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 they know what's</font>

1741
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,109
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better and they know it</font>

1742
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:06,630
doesn't do all of the things they want

1743
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:08,609
it to do now and so you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

1744
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:10,589
remember to kind of include that you

1745
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:12,420
know you're getting us and our knowledge

1746
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:14,130
and our kind of where we're going you're

1747
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,670
investing in us not you're buying a

1748
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:19,200
software product that you'll use once um

1749
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:21,270
so sales and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually getting near</font>

1750
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:23,759
the end so sales is way more complex

1751
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:26,819
than you think I cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> even begin to</font>

1752
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,960
tell you how to do this the thing is is

1753
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:30,420
that you need to understand who your

1754
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,810
ideal customer is so zoom are ideal

1755
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:35,200
customer is large companies that have

1756
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:37,570
either a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

1757
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,980
web properties that change a lot or they

1758
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:40,839
have a small number of web properties

1759
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,400
and they get a lot of their revenue

1760
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:45,790
directly from their<font color="#CCCCCC"> web sites so</font>

1761
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,190
Amazon's CNN because they get<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avenue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1762
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:50,740
revenue from advertising so basically

1763
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:52,660
large large firms that their web

1764
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,979
presence are important to them you need

1765
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is you need to</font>

1766
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:57,609
understand how budgets were there isn't

1767
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,020
a giant pot of money that everybody in

1768
01:05:57,609 --> 01:06:00,700
the company says I need to go buy

1769
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:03,820
something let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> go get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some money IT</font>

1770
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:05,470
operations has money dev has money they

1771
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:07,000
get their money allocated when their

1772
01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:09,430
fiscal year starts and they probably

1773
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">already have certain things allocated so</font>

1774
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:12,399
if you come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1775
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:14,410
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> quarter and you want to sell them</font>

1776
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know 50 grand worth of stuff they</font>

1777
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:18,578
may love you<font color="#E5E5E5"> they may think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you are the</font>

1778
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:20,290
greatest thing ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> right they can't buy</font>

1779
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,640
from you they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the money they</font>

1780
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to and they'll say talk to me in</font>

1781
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,180
six months but you're and so

1782
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,529
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not but you've got a</font>

1783
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,509
prospect and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got something now</font>

1784
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,040
maybe happen down the line but you need

1785
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:32,260
to understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works and so you</font>

1786
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,609
can identify and again this comes back

1787
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,770
to time management you need to quickly

1788
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:37,990
identify is it worth my<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to pursue</font>

1789
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:39,849
talking to this treasure like we've had

1790
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:42,040
some that sounds harsh but like we've

1791
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:43,920
had we've had some<font color="#CCCCCC"> very large companies</font>

1792
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,779
come and talk to us that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very</font>

1793
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:49,089
bureaucratic and so it's like they've

1794
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:51,819
got understand the approval process it's

1795
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:53,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">like hey I'm a developer and I manage a</font>

1796
01:06:51,819 --> 01:06:54,730
team of three developers and we want

1797
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,410
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> padieu she re</font>

1798
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:57,910
power I can't write<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a check I have</font>

1799
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:00,879
to get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy to approve it but</font>

1800
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:02,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in a budgetary freeze this</font>

1801
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,540
other people needs to approve it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1802
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,910
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten people get involved with buying</font>

1803
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:08,680
a software and it's like look maybe I

1804
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:10,240
could sell you you know five grand or 10

1805
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,589
grand worth of software but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1806
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take me three months to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1807
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:15,069
probably about 15 meetings and

1808
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:16,030
conference calls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and I'm</font>

1809
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:18,250
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1810
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:20,230
because I've got these other five people

1811
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:22,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are small that are a lot easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1812
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">me to work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now that's simply just</font>

1813
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:25,660
because we're small we don't have a

1814
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,790
dedicated sales team as you grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

1815
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:30,490
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who their job is just to run</font>

1816
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,839
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things down not a problem but you</font>

1817
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:35,970
just you kind of need to understand how

1818
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:38,319
budgets and approval processes work also

1819
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:41,709
what you're selling affects the approach

1820
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:44,290
so if you're selling into IT operations

1821
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:45,640
they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have large budgets and</font>

1822
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:46,880
they're always looking for ways to be

1823
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,819
more efficient like I

1824
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:53,210
one I te ops guy and he services 100

1825
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:55,730
machines and I let in two years time we

1826
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:57,529
want one<font color="#CCCCCC"> head count for every 120</font>

1827
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,029
machines we have so you need to

1828
01:07:57,529 --> 01:08:00,980
understand what motivates each group

1829
01:07:59,029 --> 01:08:04,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> selling to that kind of gets</font>

1830
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:05,359
back to messaging sales funnel I don't

1831
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:07,339
want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this too much but</font>

1832
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:09,109
sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually i'll talk about this just</font>

1833
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:11,990
for a second sales is not I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1834
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:13,519
cool here's a check so as naive is

1835
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:15,078
that's what i thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was seriously</font>

1836
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:16,908
when I thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had like one of my</font>

1837
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:18,170
first calls after i started this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1838
01:08:16,908 --> 01:08:20,120
met this guy he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all this is</font>

1839
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,440
awesome man i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to end like</font>

1840
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,120
these three guys on my team we should

1841
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,000
totally use this on like oven awesome

1842
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so here's what it costs um how</font>

1843
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,649
should we do this and he's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what no</font>

1844
01:08:28,609 --> 01:08:31,730
like we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get other</font>

1845
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:34,250
people involved I don't even have

1846
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:36,108
approval to like go even look at new

1847
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,908
tools you know also back to the

1848
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:40,370
purchasing process some companies are

1849
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:41,870
like for any software you buy you have

1850
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,399
to get not only a quote from one vendor

1851
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,750
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find three other vendors</font>

1852
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:46,638
that also offer the same thing get a

1853
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:47,779
quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we buy the lowest well that</font>

1854
01:08:46,639 --> 01:08:49,639
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work when you're in a</font>

1855
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:51,650
really new industry right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

1856
01:08:49,639 --> 01:08:53,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have necessarily somebody who does</font>

1857
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,528
exactly what we do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some people</font>

1858
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:56,388
who solved the problem in a different

1859
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:59,659
way that's actually not as good as what

1860
01:08:56,389 --> 01:09:01,489
we do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's it's so it it</font>

1861
01:08:59,658 --> 01:09:02,988
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very challenging basically you</font>

1862
01:09:01,488 --> 01:09:04,818
gather sales prospects this is what

1863
01:09:02,988 --> 01:09:06,888
marketing is about this is like pressing

1864
01:09:04,819 --> 01:09:08,029
flesh you know shaking hands given out

1865
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,319
business cards you're getting your name

1866
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:10,549
out there and you have people contact

1867
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:12,469
you there like hey what you do is

1868
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:14,420
interesting tell me more and then you do

1869
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:16,549
what's called qualifying a lead which is

1870
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:19,339
basically hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets me tell me what it is</font>

1871
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:21,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will tell you</font>

1872
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:22,130
what we actually do and let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1873
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:23,540
there's some common ground where we

1874
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:25,400
could actually help each other great

1875
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:28,580
example a large federal government

1876
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:30,138
agency contacted us and said hey we've

1877
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:31,939
got a lot of static content online a lot

1878
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:33,830
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people access us and we'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like</font>

1879
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:35,750
to maybe try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this faster and</font>

1880
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:38,988
it's like well given what they have and

1881
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:40,819
who uses it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic it is we</font>

1882
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:42,349
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you but it honestly wouldn't</font>

1883
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:43,460
really help you that much and you're the

1884
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,810
federal government<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so getting</font>

1885
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,639
approval for this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably take a long</font>

1886
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:48,009
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know what doesn't really</font>

1887
01:09:46,639 --> 01:09:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sense for us to keep talking and</font>

1888
01:09:48,009 --> 01:09:51,620
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know that's you say that</font>

1889
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,880
nicely but that's kind of the

1890
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,010
conversation you have and so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1891
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,989
lead it made sense but it they weren't

1892
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,630
really the right fit and so that gets

1893
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,459
back to understand

1894
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:01,320
the deal understanding their needs

1895
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,699
closing deals her film<font color="#CCCCCC"> its is something</font>

1896
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,960
a lot of people forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the software</font>

1897
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,178
industry it's great you just give them

1898
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,280
software but fulfillment is also like

1899
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:09,690
doing continual support basically it's

1900
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:13,800
fulfilling the order giving them what

1901
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:15,210
they asked for um this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> key so</font>

1902
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,980
starting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot tell you how much</font>

1903
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has helped me you know people who</font>

1904
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:20,909
know people who need what you're selling

1905
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:22,710
you do every single person in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

1906
01:10:20,909 --> 01:10:25,110
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone like if you have an idea</font>

1907
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">for something you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who</font>

1908
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:29,670
knows somebody who wants that you

1909
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:31,050
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so I I mean I did a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1910
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:33,270
security perfect example so I did

1911
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:35,010
security so I know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guys at</font>

1912
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,000
major corporations that but they're on

1913
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:37,320
the security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're the</font>

1914
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,730
security ops team they don't manage

1915
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,370
performance but you know what they know

1916
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:43,290
the guy who runs the devil shop or they

1917
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,120
know the guy who's in charge of server

1918
01:10:43,290 --> 01:10:47,040
configurations and you know the data

1919
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,330
center I don't know them I don't know

1920
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,040
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who directly knows them but I</font>

1921
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:52,530
know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who knows money so</font>

1922
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:54,659
LinkedIn totally your friend basically I

1923
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">went through when i was looking at early</font>

1924
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:58,379
customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said i want somebody in</font>

1925
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:00,960
Atlanta<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that way I can go on site we</font>

1926
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,730
can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them really big but build</font>

1927
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,429
a good relationship wikipedia

1928
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,330
incidentally has an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> entitled</font>

1929
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:09,150
businesses with headquarters in Atlanta

1930
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:11,460
and I went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list that I applied my</font>

1931
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:16,440
criteria of who's an ideal customer so

1932
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:18,510
who's here UPS is based here Equifax is

1933
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,710
based here coca-cola is based here

1934
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,389
there's a button so I just basically

1935
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:23,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">built this giant list of everybody that</font>

1936
01:11:21,389 --> 01:11:25,530
would be a good fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I then went on</font>

1937
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:28,290
linkedin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said okay who do I know</font>

1938
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:29,820
that knows somebody at these companies

1939
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,810
and then I went out to those people and

1940
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,190
I said hey can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give me an</font>

2002
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,480

that runway basically threw into next

2079

2096
01:17:19,449 --> 01:17:27,768
that's true I'm so art so it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

2097
01:17:26,269 --> 01:17:30,469
what you're selling them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so our product</font>

2098
01:17:27,769 --> 01:17:31,519
is billed per user per month and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

2099
01:17:30,469 --> 01:17:36,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to buy a one-year contract</font>

2100
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:37,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">with us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we basically are going</font>

2101
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,650
back every year and selling them more

2102
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:42,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so it might be hey we still do three</font>

2103
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:43,489
license last year but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is</font>

2104
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,079
that they've given us a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback</font>

2105
01:17:43,489 --> 01:17:48,289
and they're like oh wow you know maybe

2106
01:17:45,079 --> 01:17:50,119
IT operations is using this but they're

2107
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a major redesign of their website</font>

2108
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:53,688
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this because you talked to</font>

2109
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,099
them fairly regularly because they're

2110
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:56,659
using your product and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

2111
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:59,150
asking them for feedback or if they have

2112
01:17:56,659 --> 01:18:00,170
bugs or problems and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

2113
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,388
learned what's going on inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2114
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:04,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">company you can be like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know hey we</font>

2115
01:18:02,389 --> 01:18:07,389
could give you three more licenses and

2116
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:09,320
give you a forty percent discount and

2117
01:18:07,389 --> 01:18:11,420
that's the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want them</font>

2118
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,889
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be referenceable customers so right</font>

2119
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,599
now when you're having a prospect and

2120
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:16,070
they're like I don't know we're

2121
01:18:14,599 --> 01:18:17,719
evaluating your solutions with somebody

2122
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,429
else it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got three customers</font>

2123
01:18:17,719 --> 01:18:20,749
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that have all agreed to be</font>

2124
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:22,099
referenced customers you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can call them</font>

2125
01:18:20,749 --> 01:18:23,840
right now I won't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the phone</font>

2126
01:18:22,099 --> 01:18:25,760
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can ask them anything you want</font>

2127
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,409
about us and they've used us and so yeah

2128
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,280
you you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely want those good</font>

2129
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:30,280
relationships with them

2130
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:37,170
yeah here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing when you</font>

2131
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,580
make the price tag you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them any</font>

2132
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,110
type of discount you want right you

2133
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,490
could be like I'm giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a seventy</font>

2134
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,929
percent discount well yeah that's

2135
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:44,219
because I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> made the price this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

2136
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,750
could say I was giving you a 70 because

2137
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,500
I minute scout that's the are great

2138
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:47,670
thing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

2139
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,080
customers and there isn't kind of like

2140
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:50,370
an established price for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> product</font>

2141
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're still kind of feeling it out</font>

2142
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:55,200
you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean it is kind of</font>

2143
01:18:52,740 --> 01:19:06,530
gaming the system but everybody knows

2144
01:18:55,200 --> 01:19:06,530
you're doing it too so yeah normally not

2145
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:15,839
you know yeah it's in totally like how

2146
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:18,300
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys use this software do you</font>

2147
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it what did you what made you buy</font>

2148
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:21,330
this over something else those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2149
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:23,310
types of questions they<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

2150
01:19:21,330 --> 01:19:25,440
like what you ask somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

2151
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:27,450
checking like a job reference it's the

2152
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,400
same thing I've never heard of somebody

2153
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:35,580
asking a reference customer how much are

2154
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:37,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys paying for this yeah we don't</font>

2155
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">really do advertising most of our work</font>

01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:46,590
conferences we've had like inserts in

2159
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,540
the bag and stuff like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

2160
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:51,200
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really looked at pay-per-click I'm</font>

2161
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:53,220
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at google adwords but</font>

2162
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,470
honestly we haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed that</font>

2163
01:19:53,220 --> 01:20:01,040
out too much yet so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

2164
01:19:55,470 --> 01:20:04,820
advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> there sweet any other questions</font>

wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok great yes</font>

2166
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:19,699
he might beat me but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what sure yeah</font>

2167
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:21,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can ask oh great great point so this</font>

2168
01:20:19,699 --> 01:20:23,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets back to the approval process so and</font>

2169
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:24,889
when I was a manager in HP I could

2170
01:20:23,179 --> 01:20:28,219
approve a or I could have proved up to

2171
01:20:24,889 --> 01:20:29,840
five thousand dollars so if if somebody

2172
01:20:28,219 --> 01:20:33,199
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make a trip I</font>

2173
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:35,149
could be like yes approved and if it was

2174
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:37,398
over that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed oversight now at</font>

2175
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:39,800
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the status quo then</font>

2176
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,499
we hit a budget thing kind of early on

2177
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:45,229
inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of HP where I had to go to my</font>

2178
01:20:42,499 --> 01:20:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediate boss and say I recommend we</font>

2179
01:20:45,229 --> 01:20:50,719
make this expense it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know above</font>

2180
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty-five hundred dollars and I had to</font>

2181
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,349
get his<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay before I could go it so</font>

2182
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:56,570
understanding kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

2183
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:58,820
approval process so if you're selling

2184
01:20:56,570 --> 01:21:00,648
you know like great example is red gates

2185
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,449
Red Gate<font color="#CCCCCC"> make some awesome tools for</font>

2186
01:21:00,649 --> 01:21:04,010
developers to basically do like

2187
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:06,259
debugging and find memory traces and

2188
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:08,179
stuff like that their pricing is such

2189
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,919
that a frontline employee with like a

2190
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:11,809
pcard you know what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit card</font>

2191
01:21:09,919 --> 01:21:13,429
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there not have to go to</font>

2192
01:21:11,809 --> 01:21:15,979
anybody higher and just be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bought</font>

2193
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:18,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">a one user seat license for that and if</font>

2194
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:19,579
you're selling a utility that you're

2195
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have large number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

2196
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:22,849
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to price it so that a</font>

2197
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:24,848
frontline person does not have to ask

2198
01:21:22,849 --> 01:21:27,439
anybody permission they can just buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

2199
01:21:24,849 --> 01:21:28,699
so yeah great point you you definitely

2200
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,189
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand where those brakes</font>

2201
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:33,469
are inside an organization typically my

2202
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:35,809
experience has shown front line manager

2203
01:21:33,469 --> 01:21:39,050
can approve normally up to a couple

2204
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand dollars sometimes it's too but</font>

2205
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:42,939
five seems to be about where that limit

2206
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,938
is

2207
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,480
three was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one you dealt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with so yeah</font>

2208
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right another good question so we</font>

2209
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:57,030
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with this too much</font>

2210
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,530
because a lot of our systems we do not

2211
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,179
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a capital investment in them</font>

2212
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:02,910
instead we do renting through cloud

2213
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:04,440
providers but capital expenses are

2214
01:22:02,910 --> 01:22:06,059
things like servers hardware things that

2215
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:09,629
you make an investment in and then they

2216
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:12,930
depreciate over time and they have value

2217
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you can sell them and you start</font>

2218
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:17,250
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into how you do accounting</font>

2219
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:18,660
practices whether what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write off</font>

2220
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,980
in terms of expenses and things like

2221
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and honestly I don't have great</font>

2222
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,160
even answer for this oh I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

2223
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,980
accountants and there wasn't a slide on

2224
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:27,450
here by turbo tax when you have a

2225
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:30,480
corporation or your incorporated you

2226
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:31,889
have to do taxes quarterly well it

2227
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,110
depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whether you're an LLC or</font>

2228
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:36,810
s-corp Mercy Corps but you have to do

2229
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:39,389

accountant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my family and</font>

01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,960
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my family have used literally</font>

2242

four days it's great i was in their

2243

office once and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mom was there</font>

2244
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:15,660
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and she's like oh doug lie</font>

2245
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,160
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fill up your bike in</font>

2246
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,960
our front yard and you know this guy's

2247
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,639
like you know great at the temples and

2248
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:25,080
whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know my mom's totally</font>

2249
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,670
embarrassing him so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we have an</font>

2250
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,200
accountant and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will probably use him</font>

2251
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,120
next year and it probably won't cost me

2252
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty dollars you're doing it'll all</font>

2253
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,250
sixty dollars plus my time it'll

2254
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:35,010
probably cost me a couple hundred

2255
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:36,630
dollars but if if you are so

2256
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:39,240
sophisticated that you need things like

2257
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:40,530
capital expenses and depreciation and

2258
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,330
stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to bring</font>

2259
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:43,769
in an accountant bring in the accountant

2260
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:45,300
the fact that you need to bring in the

2261
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:47,130
accounting that's a good problem to have

2262
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,960
because it means you're successful

2263
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:50,910
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that many problems that</font>

2264
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to bring him in so just pay it</font>

2265
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:56,389
that's another thing like don't do it

2266
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,389
you'll pull your own hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

2267
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:16,580
yes so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just did this with a</font>

2268
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:18,469
client where they had no money for

2269
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:21,170
software but they did have money for

2270
01:24:18,469 --> 01:24:23,750
services consultants and so we wrote

2271
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:25,640
this contract as a that we are going to

2272
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:28,040
come in as consultants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do XY and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> z</font>

2273
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we will be using these tools and as</font>

2274
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,969
part of our services contract we will

2275
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,140
make these tools available to you or a

2276
01:24:31,969 --> 01:24:35,840
software company that sells you the

2277
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:37,489
tools but<font color="#E5E5E5"> where will so you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

2278
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,620
the contract to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them and I mean</font>

2279
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,940
that's again to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help them get</font>

2280
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:42,320
around their own internal

2281
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:44,389
having worked at a small or large

2282
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,799
company I can tell you there's

2283
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:47,420
that you would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think should be</font>

2284
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,100
there but it is there and what's funny

2285
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,870
is that they put all these rules in

2286
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,520
place to like enforce stuff but

2287
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:54,230
everybody there immediately learns how

2288
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,719
to hack around these rules so nobody

2289
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:57,739
actually follows any of the rules but

2290
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:02,949
the rules are there and cause problems

2291
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:02,949
for you it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really asinine but</font>

2292
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,420
exactly it doesn't it's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets complex</font>

2293
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:13,670
but that's a good point so if you're

2294
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:15,170
selling software under snow gets back to

2295
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:18,380
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> your budget comes from how often</font>

2296
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:20,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that budget allocated and so if you</font>

2297
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:23,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys have ever worked in consulting or</font>

2298
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:25,190
security consultants especially did tons

2299
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:26,810
of business<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of a company's</font>

2300
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:29,540
fiscal year because the companies like

2301
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:32,330
 we allocated you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 grand</font>

2302
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:34,670
this year for security or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

2303
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:37,070
consulting services and the fiscal<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

2304
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:39,170
ends in six weeks and we'd or spend this

2305
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:40,519
money or lose this money and so suddenly

2306
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:42,140
they're like holy crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that's why</font>

2307
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,810
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like ordering external</font>

2308
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:47,420
pen tests on you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> December 15th</font>

2309
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:48,800
and you're like come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on seriously you're</font>

2310
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,110
like thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the money but seriously</font>

2311
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:54,830
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they were about to lose</font>

2312
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:56,330
it and so as a as a sales kind of sales

2313
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:58,580
side you can kind of use that to your

2314
01:25:56,330 --> 01:26:00,769
advantage because you if you're trading

2315
01:25:58,580 --> 01:26:03,680
a company that's publicly traded you

2316
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:05,239
know when their fiscal year is it it's

2317
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,500
public knowledge so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

2318
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">good idea of when their budget is</font>

2319
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,160
getting allocated when their budget is

2320
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:11,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about to be gone and so that can kind of</font>
