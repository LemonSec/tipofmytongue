54
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:49,959
and they called him rocket and we had a

55
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,420
little disagreement with rocket not a

56
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,580
confrontational one but we felt that

57
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,070
rocket was doing his conference just to

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,500
make money we didn't really see that he

59
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,799
had a major motivation for that other

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:08,530

together the first outer zone in two

65
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,390
weeks we did it from five different

66
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">cities over Skype I pulled off the</font>

67
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,940
coolest hack until just recently by

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,829
tethering my blackberry to my laptop

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,590
using skype and having a conversation

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,480
while doing 55 down the interstate so

71
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,430
that was that was back in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

72
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,340
it was a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we actually put</font>

73
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,480
that together inside of two weeks we got

74
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,280
a hotel room and got some speakers the

75
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,399
people we knew could you know come in

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,800
and a pension to a talk and basically

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,230
got a suite and a bunch of us hung out

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,610
and we had drinks and you know did some

79
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,268
talks they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recorded</font>

80
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,489
at one point so we got to the end of

81
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and everyone said oh let's do this</font>

82
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:01,690
again next year well the next time we

83
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,610

84
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,160
regular hotel room if you could imagine

85
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,310

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,380

101
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,570
part of the story is the same exact

102
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,090
interaction we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I met him at</font>

inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a an easel</font>

105
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,870
with a piece of foam core on and saying

106
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,570
signed the board if you know for coming

107
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,040
to outer zone and he kind of stuck his

108
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,120
head in you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand rick is a</font>

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,600
pretty good-sized guy and just

110
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,050
completely also called my attention so I

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,490
stepped up and we had this in you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

112
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,980
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat and I didn't know who he was</font>

113
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:21,880

119
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,000
kind of started building and expanding

120
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,410
and everything we've never well the last

121

and probably kill your liver but at

132
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,030
least you know you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance of</font>

139
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,039
can imagine there were 20 goons

140
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,890
corralling 13,000 people it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

141

we're so nice apparently but everything

142
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,240
flowed very well but there were people

143
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,710
that went there that new other people

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,200
