6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:39,149
flash the signal area I just haven't had

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:44,360
a chance to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet yeah so we can</font>

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,679
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you could cue them by audio</font>

14
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:18,689
presentation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while back we did a</font>

15
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,950
conference here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matthew shoemaker</font>

16
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:25,559
and which we call shook on and I did

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,729
this presentation here my only trouble

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,210
is he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok you can buy</font>

19
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,820
keynote for dollars ten dollars yeah I

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,189
own keynote on the iPad I don't on this

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,679
mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did the trial version the trouble</font>

22
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,869
is I can't export it out of here or move

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,329
it over and get it to my iPad make it

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,100
work which was what my plan was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

25
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,689
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in and modify</font>

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,350
and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything the way I wanted</font>

27
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,059
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we are I'm doing this talk</font>

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,270
will go change the name or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,070
like that so the time of my talk is the

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,080
modern-day hacker artist engineer

31
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,740
mechanic

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:09,020
um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a subject matter expert on</font>

33
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,590
everything have some certifications but

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,540
I don't have a ton of them so what I

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,980
have more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything is interaction</font>

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,429
with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've kind of</font>

37
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,209
overtime put a lot of thought into what

38
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,550
a hacker is and so we were discussing a

39
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,260
talk that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sit down and</font>

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,460
pretty much be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject matter expert</font>

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:36,679
on and this is it so what do audience

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,470
participation time so there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ton</font>

43
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,670
of people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to make</font>

44
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,990
you stand up which is really going to

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,208
suck because it's early in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning</font>

46
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you completed elementary school</font>

47
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:52,490
stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one stretch there we</font>

48
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,110
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi We're to do some jumping jacks you</font>

49
00:02:52,490 --> 00:03:00,530
ready one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and isn't this is only</font>

50
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">two to show diversity in our crowd who</font>

51
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,290
passed high school if you have passed

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">aiko high school student</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who did</font>

53
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,549
some college there one went through

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,709
college some<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who actually graduated</font>

55
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:20,090
with a degree if you graduate and still

56
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:24,320
stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who stayed and got their</font>

57
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,980
masters beat the crap out of these

58
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,180
people later they make us look bad see

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,850
you see we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little you can go</font>

60
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,670
ahead and sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down now you can actually</font>

61
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,920
see the diversity in our crown most

62
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:42,760
people made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through high school some</font>

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,760
of us actually made it to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> master's so</font>

64
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,420
we all are<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting around most of us in</font>

65
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,280
black t-shirts we all kind of look the

66
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,940
same in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way you know we're all funny</font>

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,070
looking from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the neck up but um we're</font>

68
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,079
all pretty much everyone treats you each

69
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,519
other like they're just one of the crowd

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,760
if someone asked you for a hand you

71
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,880
definitely give them a hand but how does

72
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,420
your education level actually impact how

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,470
people see you so

74
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:15,359
um does it indicate overall intelligence

75
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,620
or skill set<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm no okay thank you I</font>

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,260
appreciate that makes the rest of this

77
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:28,380
presentation real easy to someone argued

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:35,820
it was really suck so I work for a major

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:39,479
southern university huh yes I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lone</font>

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,669
keeper let me tell you something every

81
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,750
blade is the exact same height I<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

82
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,520
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that oh yeah this is this is</font>

83
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,479
one of those take a snap snap shot in

84
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:58,109
the campus<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so I work for matric</font>

85
00:04:51,479 --> 00:05:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">University I redundant storage system</font>

86
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,880
its rates<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ethically redundant</font>

87
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,679
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're two systems located in</font>

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">different sections of the campus for 102</font>

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,550
terabytes total space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've built it</font>

90
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,650
for less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

91
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:25,680
who knows who EMC is EMC hates me on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

92
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:29,729
campus because for so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys at</font>

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:35,669
emc and the IDF department wanted to

94
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:40,260
sell me is this cutting in and out but I

95
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:42,900
like this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day one take the clown</font>

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,260
nose Oh what I want the paper this the

97
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,260
penguin

98
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:58,330
that any<font color="#E5E5E5"> better all right I'm so the</font>

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,750
guys with emc in the IT department at my

100
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:04,390
university don't don't really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

101
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,550
because their price tag for a terabyte

102
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,650
of storage per year was three thousand

103
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,050
dollars so our original estimate of

104
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,890
needing 30 terabytes of storage would

105
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">have cost 90 thousand dollars a year</font>

106
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:19,990
that's per year aside from the 11

107
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,930
hundred thousand dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built</font>

108
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">mine for one time cost and that left us</font>

109
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,640
with information in one place and no

110
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,260
backup so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a geographically</font>

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,300
redundant when meaning if the campus

112
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,940
burns down they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never ever find me</font>

113
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,140
ever again it holds a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million dollar</font>

114
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,790
research data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

115
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,740
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to do that i</font>

116
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,750
asked questions on the bsd forum about

117
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,270
hey how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cut a one terabyte slice</font>

118
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,280
because f just doesn't do it and someone

119
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">said oh you use GPT i think is your</font>

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,780
array and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 12</font>

121
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,000
terabytes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough Jessie's to</font>

122
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,789
do 25 and a half and there was crickets

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,670
and everyone said nobody's doing that

124
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:05,500
and I thought oh I'm in trouble so

125
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:09,570
I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that together for</font>

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:13,180
them so who all's got a certification in

127
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:16,349
addition to or instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a degree raise</font>

128
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:21,090
your arm up come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in stretch okay</font>

129
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:23,530
who's got five certifications or more

130
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scott has them up Scott makes them up</font>

131
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,080
who you kidding me you're terrible

132
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're terrible</font>

133
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,498
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your own we just do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a</font>

134
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement who make some decent cash</font>

135
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:39,860
doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> show or doing the doing a class</font>

136
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:44,759
somewhere here it's very profitable um

137
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:48,779
so I i feel like i'm showing my age

138
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,189
today anyway I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 years old and I've</font>

139
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,949
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with computers since I was</font>

140
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:56,159
11<font color="#CCCCCC"> so someone do the math it's more than</font>

141
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:59,580
a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I carry one certification</font>

142
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,729
and it's actually Scott's class for

143
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,258
certified data recovery expert which I

144
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,469
figured if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I'm going to</font>

145
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">do one that sounds really damn good so</font>

146
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:12,949
so I have one certificate on my wall and

147
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,388
it's a certified data recovery expert

148
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,620
Scott's class-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm skipping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

149
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,740
going to plug your class real quick

150
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,499
Scott teaches you how to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font>

151
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,330
recover data from a hard drive you

152
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:27,059
understand from the time you plug the

153
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,490
power plug in until the time you unplug

154
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,949
it everything the hard drive does it's

155
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,789
like being fed information from a fire

156
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:37,409
hose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spent from eight thirty nine</font>

157
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,479
o'clock every morning to about nine

158
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:43,529
o'clock at night listening to Scott and

159
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,420
asking him questions by friday<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did not</font>

160
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,800
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single human being I didn't</font>

161
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,370
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to anybody I didn't want</font>

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,219
anything new so Carlo actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

163
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,360
to the class some internet stirs been

164
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,100
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> class there's a handful of</font>

165
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,800
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been and everyone will</font>

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,940
tell you by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time you get to Friday</font>

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,670
you can't put anything else in your

168
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,410
brain I mean it's it's it's a lot of

169
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:10,050
information but I feel that that the

170
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,889
certification not carry I earned I

171
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,180
earned every letter of it so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

172
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:17,100
a chance you can go to my hard drive

173
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,439
died calm and check out some Scott stuff

174
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,480
and if you're interested in doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

175
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:29,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">recovery so um with a college</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> degree who</font>

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,649
all's got a job<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so with a college</font>

177
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:36,119
degree you know what comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that in</font>

178
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:37,870
a job in theory well if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in</font>

179
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IT sector or how about van</font>

180
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,380
typically with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> college degree does</font>

181
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,040
not matter if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's underwater basket</font>

182
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,810
weaving or intermediate Boeing they will

183
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,819
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you've</font>

184
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,229
stuck with and apparently know how to do

185
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,170
a standardized<font color="#CCCCCC"> test so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get more</font>

186
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,540
money without a college degree they will

187
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,550
give you less because they determine if

188
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,260
you don't have a college<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree you</font>

189
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,609
didn't sit through all the classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

190
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:09,810
put the funny little cap on so here I am

191
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:13,990
um what I do for my university is I

192
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:17,619
basically gave them large scale storage

193
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,690
for a inexpensive price and I am the

194
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">only person that maintains it I'm the</font>

195
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">only person that can do freebsd from the</font>

196
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,520
command line and not be scared of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

197
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,920
mentioned earlier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I my coolest hack</font>

198
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,110
years ago was tethering through my

199
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,329
blackberry skyping while I was going

200
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the interstate the newest one I did</font>

201
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:40,960
I thought was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good was my iPad I</font>

202
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,430
logged<font color="#CCCCCC"> into my array unmounted the</font>

00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,490
shares cut a one terabyte slice

204
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,229
remounted everything from 30,000 feet I

205
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,820
was on the southwest flight and I

206
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,240
thought boy that'd be kind of fun let's

207
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,370
see if I can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I'm the only one</font>

208
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,440
in our group that actually is

209
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,000
comfortable doing bsd and things like

210
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:04,930
that everyone else's the windows kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
guy so I left<font color="#CCCCCC"> college can someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give a</font>

212
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:16,510
guess what I left<font color="#E5E5E5"> college with what my</font>

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,430
GPA was 2.5 lower lower a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six what</font>

214
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:23,650
college you go in twos Phoenix actually

215
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,920
give you solid numbers 1.8 lower 1.6

216
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:28,329
lower

217
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,010
they said mr. Hearn you should

218
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,420
reconsider what you'd like to do for the

219
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your life because apparently</font>

220
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,140
college is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it I left Tennessee Tech</font>

221
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,110
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1.02 now I have above-average</font>

222
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,370
intelligence but apparently I have the

223
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,620
attention span of a gnat with amnesia

224
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:51,520
when you put women alcohol and doughnuts

225
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:52,840
in front of me so so um yeah I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

226
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,010
I'm laying everything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> front of you</font>

227
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,050
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so so one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

228
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">my things that I'm going to pass along</font>

229
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,579
to you stay in school dear God and get

230
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,260
your degree because it definitely just

231
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,970
gets you some more cash from that

232
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,260
standpoint I work with PhDs and they

233
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,570
don't understand the concept of a

234
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">computer if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not quantitative</font>

235
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,510
analysis they don't understand what the

236
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,020
hell you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about who knows what</font>

237
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,420
quantitative<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis is I'd ask you to</font>

238
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">give that definition but the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

239
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,270
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my talk would be consumed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

240
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:30,010
you explaining what kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

241
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:32,170
quantitative analysis is um so a lot of

242
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,390
us don't exactly make a ton of cash and

243
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,240
it is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> because what we do is not</font>

244
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,340
valuable it's typically no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

245
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,380
understands<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do and doesn't</font>

246
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,300
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> the value behind what we're</font>

247
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,189
able to do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think they walk</font>

248
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,650
into our office and say hang yet blah

249
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we turn around and click a few</font>

250
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,740
buttons and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think well</font>

251
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">jeez that was easy well they don't</font>

252
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me knowing how to click</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

253
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,450
few buttons is because I've spent 10

254
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,950
hours researching<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem one of</font>

282
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:08,749
what do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know how to take a</font>

283
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,579
standardized<font color="#CCCCCC"> test you know I had to take</font>

284
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:12,050
notes in class I know how to pay

285
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to what's in bold print the</font>

286
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,769
book but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that get me well I</font>

287
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:19,819
can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you it gets you a piece of</font>

288
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:22,819
paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money but what we</font>

289
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:24,740
actually know how to do is our ability

290
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:26,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">to troubleshoot to think around corners</font>

291
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,429
outside the box outside the nine dots

292
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,109
whatever your goal term is for it where

293
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:35,389
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter if you've graduated</font>

294
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,009
college if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you understand how that works</font>

295
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:39,139
and typically everyone in this room does

296
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,389
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think around corners you can</font>

297
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">make things happen where you don't have</font>

298
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,620
a degree that says you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font>

299
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,240
master's in computer science but you're

300
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,730
running circles around everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

301
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:57,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you understand how things work</font>

302
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:59,120
so how we're portrayed in the media this

303
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:06,589
is the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for years and</font>

304
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:09,620
um do it smithereens oh those

305
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:11,689
smithereens there we go so everyone's

306
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,459
over this is this graphic you know

307
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:15,589
hackers can come to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> home computer</font>

308
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,089
into a bomb well you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mitnick who</font>

309
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:20,569
could whistle codes into a phone and

310
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:22,429
launch missiles from NORAD all of these

311
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people think that we do that</font>

312
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:27,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">are complete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another and we</font>

313
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,790
have to argue with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people yeah we're</font>

314
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,149
hackers but no we don't break<font color="#E5E5E5"> into think</font>

315
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,649
everything all the time typically media

316
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:37,579
is the one who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has done the worst damage</font>

317
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,279
to us being 40 back in the day we used

318
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:42,319
to have hackers and crackers and then it

319
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,569
became black hats and white hats and

320
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:47,569
gray hats and now we're hackers and

321
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:49,748
makers and apparently we're all bad do

322
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:49,748
what

323
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:58,249
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually I believe was in</font>

324
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,209
2007 but the article<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dated 2009</font>

325
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,459
Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> you from the Atlanta</font>

326
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,799
journal-constitution came to outer zone

327
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:08,399
and it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first time I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

328
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the media in dealing with the the</font>

329
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,660
hacker conference thing and the guy came

330
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,639
out and said I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really talk to</font>

331
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,488
people and do a report and all that

332
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:22,139
stuff and I said cool I have one caveat

333
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:24,749
to that you have to not portray us as

334
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,220
bad people in press I said you talked to

335
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,679
anyone you want that's completely fine

336
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,589
with me but you cannot go through and

337
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:32,910
say that we came out here and we were

338
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:38,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about how to destroy everything</font>

339
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:42,329
and he said no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all so</font>

340
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:44,419
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did you spit in his food would</font>

341
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,399
you take me<font color="#E5E5E5"> lunch as penance wait for me</font>

342
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:51,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">now he actually talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of</font>

343
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,109
people um what was it the professor

344
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,669
what's his name Charl<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charles hold or</font>

345
00:16:55,109 --> 00:16:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thomas Holt that's right I haven't seen</font>

346
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:00,539
him in forever he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said in and talked</font>

347
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:04,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">with him and Thomas had done a talk or</font>

348
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:08,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">dunna his dissertation on computer</font>

349
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,409
criminals and so he talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

350
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,490
people and talking to Simon<font color="#CCCCCC"> techie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

351
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:14,639
don't think it's here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he's out</font>

352
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,039
of pocket now so he talked a lot of

353
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:18,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">people he put this article together so</font>

354
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,039
here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some quotes from it the term</font>

355
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,658
hacker describes someone who changes

356
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,059
someone else's computer software or

357
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware sometimes breaking into secured</font>

358
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:33,360
zones so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ordered a copy of this news</font>

359
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,649
article and it came to my office and my

360
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,299
dentist would like to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me about</font>

361
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:39,149
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i grit my teeth but I</font>

362
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:42,179
was ready to kill this guy you moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

363
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:44,129
the next lower quote he continued we are

364
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,620
a little bit bizarre this actually quote

365
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,360
from Simon terribly we are a little bit

366
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,830
bizarre we want everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how we</font>

367
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,289
do it we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

368
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:57,320
internet and destroy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this actual</font>

369
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,309
quote was at the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> article</font>

370
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,960
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take down the</font>

371
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,010
internet and destroy it

372
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,809
and he tagged on or will they oh my god

373
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,700

374
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:12,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but putting that last line in</font>

375
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,710
really infuriated<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because we accepted</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">do everything nice and hidden well this</font>

381
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,039
guy came in and I shook his hand I

382
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,080
talked to him and he had full run of the

383
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:30,450
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those three words right there</font>

384
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:32,820
means he's never coming back so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

423
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,879

God stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching yourself right back in</font>

431
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,970
the day you could do that real easy it

432
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,730
was before you know everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

433
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,140
doing spam so you know we you send

434
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,030
somebody in the office an email from

435
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,400
someone else's account and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

438
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,850
we also will make jokes of our friends

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,980
Billy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hoffman's quote actually it shook</font>

440
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,070
on you can always fix it everything

441
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,830
later this is during Billy's talk about

442
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,600
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start a start-up and yeah it's</font>

443
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,899
kind of ironic that you fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> later of</font>

444
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,219
course he didn't catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that until he</font>

445
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,260
actually got on stage and someone

446
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,870
pointed it out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> him we will mess with</font>

447
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,220
people and we usually are pretty caustic

448
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:10,449
towards each other but we do it out of

449
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:16,200
love more than anything so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

450
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">people see us is often as criminals so</font>

451
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,160
when you define something you can also

452
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,220
look at it it's something or it's easier

453
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:29,050
to understand what it's not so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

454
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:32,770
current definition of a hacker if you

455
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:34,690
ask me to circumvent security for the

456
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,629
most part I can circumvent security on

457
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,250
most things when I walk into a room I

458
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,690
pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the cameras are the</font>

459
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,660
locks for everything you know it's just

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:48,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do we're kind of bread</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

461
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:50,590
um I can break Wi-Fi you know for me web

462
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:53,230
if you're running web you deserve to

463
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:54,790
have web cracked<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from wpa2 actually</font>

479
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:34,429
doing research<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so i can pick a</font>

00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:37,129
lock well if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pick a lot getting into</font>

481
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:39,680
the wrong thing i cease being a hacker

482
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:43,730
and I step over into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of being</font>

483
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">a criminal right I'm a hacker step over</font>

484
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that line I break along I now criminal</font>

485
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,600
so the problem is the media says oh my

486
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,510
god you know these guys these hackers

487
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,189
broke in and did all this damage well no

488
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,930
these criminals broke in who did all

489
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage the hackers are the ones</font>

490
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,960
they bring in to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that after the</font>

491
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,670
fact because it didn't pay attention to

492
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the first time we sent them a</font>

493
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,940
proposal explained exactly what we were

494
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,550
supposed to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they thought we were</font>

495
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,050
full of so you know we go in after

496
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,159
the fact to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff but</font>

497
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,020
it's the people who have stepped over

498
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,130
the line and become criminals that are

499
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:24,100
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem the media portrays</font>

500
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:28,430
this as blah um we're kind of

501
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:30,530
pigeon-holed in a way but we try to sit

502

define what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hacker is for me I'm a</font>

514
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,040
hacker I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer guy and I get into</font>

that if I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit down and try to</font>

518
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:10,430
explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what a hacker</font>

519
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,600
is and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you get down</font>

520
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,790
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of it they're still not going</font>

521
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand and I'd rather say yeah</font>

522
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,970
I'm a dangerous guy leave me<font color="#CCCCCC"> alone I</font>

523
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,780
went over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to play with my friends</font>

524
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,890
because they understand me so um I'm

525
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,840
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of speed up through the</font>

526
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,870
rest of this fun stuff it's a lot of

527
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,939
audience participation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sat down and</font>

528
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought up</font>

529
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a hacker well a hacker can be an</font>

530
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:37,480
artist right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will get into the</font>

531
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,279
dole definitions here or an engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

532
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,440
a mechanic now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's another</font>

533
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,330
fourth one we've talked about before but

534
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,750
for the most part we fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into</font>

535
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:49,720
these three categories i believe so da

536
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,730
Vinci was a hacker right this is the

537
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:57,220
vitruvian man everyone's seen this

538
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:59,350
before so da Vinci designed weapons he

539
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,909
had inventions I mean you go through the

540
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,580
was of the Codex<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually has all the</font>

541
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:07,480
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's done well the guy sat</font>

542
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:10,299
down and he was an artist but he

543
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:14,139
actually did design work who knows who

544
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:18,759
this chick is right moaning Lisa you're

545
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:20,350
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong website sir so he has a</font>

546
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,360
long history of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology to make</font>

547
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,158
beautiful things da Vinci made his own

548
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,379
paints and pigments so he went through

549
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,600
and selected everything ground is on

550
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:32,529
pigments to make the paint to<font color="#CCCCCC"> paint the</font>

551
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,840
Mona Lisa he also used the science of

552
00:25:32,529 --> 00:25:38,110
his time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the golden triangle the</font>

553
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:40,570
geometry to create perspective so it's

554
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,008
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of Mona Lisa it's one</font>

555
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the first examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of when they went</font>

556
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:45,639
through and used the triangle for

557
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:48,940
perspective so the guy wasn't playing

558
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:52,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">around then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have other people that</font>

559
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:55,450
do sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of performance art kind of</font>

560
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:00,370
things who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a dot matrix printer</font>

561
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:04,480

00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:11,710
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was being printed and generate</font>

566

click and the printer<font color="#E5E5E5"> would start</font>

570
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:20,500
printing and it would play you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

573
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:28,929
character was what tone so you know

574
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,509
we've done some things to try to do the

575
00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:34,269
whole artist thing using the technology

576
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:37,460
we have what was everyone's first

that I've ever seen war games at all

599
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,120
it's bizarre trivia so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Radio Shack</font>

600
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:56,669
actually put<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a synthesizer it was</font>

601
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,678
monophonic and it had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge ribbon</font>

cable you plugged it to the bottom side

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this chunky piece of crap machine and</font>

604
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:05,549
you could program it to play music I got

605
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,080
a kick out of it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could then</font>

606
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,720
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down in program music on it which</font>

607
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:13,408
was like using punch cards at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

608
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,809
but that was my first movement into

609
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:17,580
computer music and I really enjoyed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

610
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:21,059
then moved from that two keyboards and

611
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:24,928
things of that nature who's been to a

612
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:27,389
Nine Inch Nails concert<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay much</font>

613
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:28,710
smaller demographic than I thought the

614
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:31,380
last one I went to they actually had

615
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,820
programmable screens on stage if there

616
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,440
had been some jackass and back the crowd

617
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,600
with a laser printer or laser pointer

618
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,140
rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> trent reznor could walk up to the</font>

619
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,600
screen and actually do

620
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,860
put his hands up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the beat and</font>

621
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,600
things of music they were playing

622
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,010
unfortunately someone in the back keps

623
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,929
uni with a laser pointer and screwed

624
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,440
that up but they did a lot of

625
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:52,980
performance art that was not just flashy

626
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,940
effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually had a lot of really</font>

627
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,150
meaningful<font color="#CCCCCC"> but add meaning to the song</font>

628
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:02,620
it actually was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful and then</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I've smoked some more anyway um so as</font>

kevin Mitnick is has ever talked to him

633
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce something</font>

634
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:21,490
called the artists I've met bet

635
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,490
Nick nice character he is definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

636
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,470
 artist he his claim to fame is

637
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,420
more social engineer than actual hacker

638
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,210
he's a mechanic he went blind on

639
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,730
something until it broke so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we kind of</font>

640
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:37,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my little joke about him as the</font>

641
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:40,420
 artist um let's see we have the

642
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineer so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> termed the engineer</font>

643
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,930
someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets out to write a piece of</font>

644
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,740
code to accomplish a task or to replace

645
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:49,950
something or enhance something so you

646
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,950
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that or a designer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware</font>

647
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:55,300
you know things so the rig that's not

648
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,440
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of right now he's</font>

649
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,500
playing currently playing with this

650
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,990
phone instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paying attention to it</font>

651
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,420
it is the the newest<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of the</font>

652
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">recording system we built last year it</font>

653
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,660
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's over an hour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to set it up</font>

654
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,660
on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plug all the cables in</font>

655
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,550
now we bring it out open it up but one

656
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,760
plug in it but the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeds and turn</font>

657
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,470
it on it's ready to go that was the me

658
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,240
sitting down and saying I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tired</font>

659
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,730
of lugging you know five cases of

660
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:26,850
equipment out I consolidated it into one

661
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's all ready to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go so it wasn't a</font>

662
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:32,080
someone said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know hey we ought to do</font>

663
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,669
this it was me thinking boy I'm really

664
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,560
tired of doing it this way let's find a

665
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,970
better way and that ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up being the</font>

666
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,970
better way out or at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope so</font>

667
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:47,410
let's see as far as the mechanical side

668
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,570
of things you have the maker movement at

669
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font>

670
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:54,530
point kind of fits into this category

671
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,870
it's we make something better we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

672
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,879
cheaper we find a different way to go

673
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:02,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's ever messed with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sugrue does</font>

674
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,880
it might know what that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

675
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:07,129
European company that made this moldable

676
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,630
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> silicone but it's a</font>

677
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:10,280
putty and you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into whatever</font>

678
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,490
shape and if you leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a couple</font>

679
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,810
hours it then becomes nice and solid

680
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:17,810
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the newest things out for</font>

681
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,919
makers<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you don't have a 3d</font>

682
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,300
printer you can make pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

683
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you want it's more freeform</font>

684
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:30,169
than anything but once it cures up it's

685
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:31,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">very durable so there's we kind of the</font>

686
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,100
hacker maker side of things the

687
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,710
engineering is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

688
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,889
figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do something in an</font>

689
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:44,110
innovative way cheaper faster things of

690
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:47,390
that nature who<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to movie hackers</font>

691
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:52,159
unfortunately angelina jolie<font color="#CCCCCC"> this town</font>

692
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:54,070
where they come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well Johnny</font>

693
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,370
whatever his name is he married her

694
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:00,710
honey get away with that so one of the

695
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:02,209
best quotes which there were very few in

696
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie was hacking is not a talent</font>

697
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,330
it's a survival skill which i think is

698
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">great because we look at things a lot</font>

699
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,980
differently than most people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

700
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:17,389
as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what an object is get to that</font>

701
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,700
while looking for a definition is bad

702
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,530
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define something you run the</font>

703
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,510
risk of limiting it or if you limit our

704
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:25,940
thoughts you ruin the spirit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

705
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,290
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I did put everyone into three</font>

706
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,720
different categories but I didn't do

707
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,070
that to say you're only an artist this

708
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,510
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the segment of what you're doing</font>

709
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:38,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the moment so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

718
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:11,370
comes from that's another one less fun

719
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:13,899
inside jokes we have so what do you see

720

731
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,120
thin sheet metal when I cut it it then

732

755
00:34:56,629 --> 00:35:04,430
credited him<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry i'll change that</font>

756

757
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,890
you have the engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get a</font>

758
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold of something I can make something</font>

759
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,220
it's a solid sturdy thing oh here's a

760
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,869
good one didn't see you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking if</font>

761
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,109
you can do you know why the ridges on

762
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:21,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the can no one that's why the ridges on</font>

763
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> can when you grab</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hold of a coke</font>

764
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:25,450
can and you squeeze it you can compress

765
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,069
it you break the cylinder and you

766
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:30,200
compromise the cylinder the reason

767
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:32,599
they're actually ridges on a soup can is

768
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,549
those ridges actually make it

769
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,549
structurally rigid it makes it very

770
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,930
difficult for you to crush now<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 the</font>

771
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,759
steel can actually is a little bit

772
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">thicker of course than the aluminum but</font>

773
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,470
it makes it that much harder because the

774
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,670
ribs that are put in it the way they're

775
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,410
designed to actually make it more

776
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,880
structurally rigid not to me people know

777
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,390
that this is the crappy knowledge that

778
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,099
we carry around day-to-day you know

779
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,660
here's a soup can well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font>

783
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,349
coals we've got a piece of string<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

784
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,900
two tin cans we have a phone there's a

785
00:36:06,349 --> 00:36:10,819
million things we can come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

786
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,290
have our audience participation time you

787
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,569
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stand up for this one you</font>

790
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,950
one you have two feet of twine right

791
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,200
videos what twine is now string is

792
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,770
actually more organized twine is like

793
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,390
just kind of bristly fray shitty shitty

794
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:35,240
it's the cheap stuff so you have two

795
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,629
feet<font color="#E5E5E5"> of twine 24 inches you have one</font>

803
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,860
crack so she holds the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door up and right</font>

804
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:08,990
so what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do come on some I come</font>

805
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:12,170
over an idea do what what's the rules ok

806
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:15,919
someone whip his ass what are the what

807
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,390
rules do we follow typically none<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font>

808
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,740
how do you hold your door open with two

809
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:23,089
feet of twine and a pencil down the

810
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,339
pencil the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> door there's one</font>

811
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:27,200
another one stick it into the hinge side

812
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,670
of the crack it keeps the door from

813
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,669
closing completely what else we got

814
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,380
there you go or you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the twine</font>

815
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:39,320
to actually if you got a handle you

816
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,480
could tie the handle down so it never

817
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,340
locked the door it doesn't keep the door

818
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,500
open completely but it does circumvent

819
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,880
the security so the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

820
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,500
right or wrong answers there's not

821
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,730
really any rules you could stab the

822
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,190
hooker<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the eye and leave her in the</font>

823
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:55,010
crook of the door if you have a friend

Con and took the red-eye flight back

830
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,000
which don't get me tired because my mind

831
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,840
mine has a tendency to wonder when I'm

832

00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:52,500
one of the little mini markets they have

major components for hot sauce capsaicin

845
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,320
what's all so what's capsaicin also used

846
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:10,230
in pepper spray I wandered upon a shelf

847
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,900
full of pepper spray and I'm thinking to

848
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:14,400
myself wait a minute it took my nail

849
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,410

851
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,970
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that away from me but if I have a</font>

credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card how can here we go what am I</font>

853
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,399
going to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

854
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,100
anything I want so I said you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

855
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,050
let's just as an exercise because it's 2

856
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,049
a.m. and i'm tired let's figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

857
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:33,210
I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do i need a delivery mechanism</font>

858
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:35,100
hey we got several different mechanisms

859
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,750
here you know so let's drink container<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

860
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,150
can then you know open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the container</font>

861
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,160
fill it full of hot spray<font color="#CCCCCC"> i step on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

862
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,510
got the stewardess you know I can do

863
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,609
whatever I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that point I'm</font>

864
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,560
thinking this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of crazy you took</font>

865
00:39:44,609 --> 00:39:48,210
everything away from me but you gave me

866
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,619
all this so I'm blundering around

867
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,940
thinking this you know I'm taking

868
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">pictures and they're really wondering</font>

869
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,740
what I'm doing so I wonder upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

870
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:58,350
you know what these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> their wine</font>

stoppers they're a huge piece of acrylic

872
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:02,819
with a sharp and pointed edge to it you

873
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,920
took away my pocket knife which is

874
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:09,560
easily identifiable as a weapon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

875

class every time you go somewhere yes

890
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,420
they give you a steel knife and you're

891
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much closer to the cockpit at that</font>

892
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:02,250
point unless you fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Southwest like all</font>

893
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:15,630
of us have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and there is no first</font>

894
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:17,730
class really so I can't get a cookie at

895
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,869
that point I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to warm cookie but I</font>

896
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:20,340

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jackass behind me with a steel knife</font>

898
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:28,740
ok cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> his filet mignon so I kind of</font>

899
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,700
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an example about how we</font>

900
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually see objects so what do you see</font>

901
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,348
here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a triple-a upholstery</font>

902
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:40,589
company years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago in Nashville</font>

903
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:42,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tennessee that's it actually that is now</font>

904
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:45,210
the hacker consortium it's a 2500

905
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,129
square-foot hackerspace that myself and

906
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gabriel see blind here actually put</font>

907
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,440
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spent three years renovating</font>

908
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,230
the interior and we put the first paint

909
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,089
on the walls actually inside this place

910
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:59,849
we wired it with 400 amps worth of

911
00:41:57,089 --> 00:42:01,650
electricity brand new plumbing new floor

912
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:05,099
the only thing we haven't replaced is

913
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:07,320
the roof at this point but everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

914
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that drove by saw a crappy old building</font>

915
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,330
and what we saw was oh dude here's our

916
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,010
hacker space this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font>

917
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't cost us an arm and leg we got to</font>

918
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:20,010
put some elbow grease into it a lot of

919
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,300
elbow grease but what we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to on</font>

920
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other end of it was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice</font>

921
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:30,780
hackerspace so when you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

922
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,730
what do you see you see a medium for

923
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:38,010
artistry you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you can</font>

924
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:40,830
repurpose to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out of so it</font>

925
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,920
I think we see things a lot differently

926
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,630
than the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world do</font>

927
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,390
and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes us unique and very</font>

928
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:53,119
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful so when we did shook on and</font>

929
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,348
we stepped out of the hotel to go get

930
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,240
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat as we're walking down</font>

931
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:58,369
one of our guys keith was actually

932
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,020
standing looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italian</font>

933
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:02,569
restaurant on the corner was part of the

934
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,250
hotel and he was checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> out wandering</font>

935
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:06,290
back and forth and Hermione checking the

936
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,549
shingles he's like no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was seeing the</font>

937
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,400
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to climb on top of the building</font>

938
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:12,920
that's not something normal that the

939
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,599
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the mundanes do so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font>

940
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,250
becoming we're becoming very important

941
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the reason is everything's digital</font>

942
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:25,220
and we know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do ones and zeros</font>

943
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:28,010
we're becoming the jocks of the digital

944
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">age or if you're the fan of the movie</font>

945
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,250
hackers which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not specifically if</font>

946
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,230
end of the movie hackers but the

947
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,299
keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cowboys I mean that's what we</font>

948
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,819
do everything's moving towards that

949
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:40,640
direction where we're going well

950
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:45,950
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies out there</font>

951
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,650
realizing that we just demand a little

952
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,848
bit more money than they'd like to pass

953
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,760
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and simplifying</font>

954
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:56,420
everything do what yeah we got to pay

955
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,650
for Hookers<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage their kind of fun so</font>

956
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,299
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to software that doesn't</font>

957
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,450
have a command prompt no one messes of

958
00:43:59,299 --> 00:44:03,650
the command line who uses a command line

959
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,960
I've worked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> several companies where I</font>

960
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,760
was the only guy who knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I would</font>

961
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,589
say go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command line and everyone</font>

962
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,000
would just blank stare me oh dude I

963
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to use the command line why</font>

964
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,200
you know you can let<font color="#CCCCCC"> go of the mouse</font>

965
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:19,308
take your hand off the mouse and use

966
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,259
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in front of you so we're</font>

967
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:23,240
kind of in a battle at this point

968
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,680
because all these companies are saying

969
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,680
well we need to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy you have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">all in one thing you install it you know</font>

974
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,660
it's made for the guy who's somewhat

975
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,150
literate with a computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has a</font>

982
00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:54,759
was like trying to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apart with a</font>

crowbar

I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it wasn't made that way</font>

985
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,880
it was made to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be simple for you know</font>

986
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,350
the average person to mess with but I

987
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,450
had to do something with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that was</font>

988
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">outside the nine dots became very</font>

989
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:10,930
interesting where's the world headed

990
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:13,900
pissing idiocracy if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seen</font>

991
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:15,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">any accuracy I can't say that you need</font>

992
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,390
to use a torrent and downloaded I think

993
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,880
you should go to your average

994
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:21,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">blockbuster or a red box and see if you</font>

995
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,170
can check out a copy of it or you could

996
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,569
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon and purchase it or you</font>

997
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:27,600
could go to bittorrent if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

998
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,950
seen idiocracy you need to watch it

999
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,540
typically you need to up your meds a

1000
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,450
little bit the week before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

1001
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,060
it's an actual it's a it's a comedy but

1002
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close representation to</font>

1003
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,370
which direction we're going the gist of

1004
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,530
it is the average intelligence of the

1005
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:46,029
people the planet starts to nosedive and

1006
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:49,480
all the intelligent people are worried

1007
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:54,040
about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> better hair growth products</font>

1008
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,420
and erection drugs so they quit paying

1009
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:04,270
attention to what's going on and they

1010
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:06,460
slowly get weeded out what's in it say

1011
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:10,620
that one more time because I I want to

1012
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,620
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> your thoughts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on sex Adrian what</font>

1018
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,780
idiocracy was the intelligence was going

1019
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,540
down the intelligent people were slowly

1020
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,780
dying off and then the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

1021
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:45,250
became just this you know they refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1022
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,800
things we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of burrito</font>

1027
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,170
would pay attention to who's been to

regular store and you could mine for two

00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:46,270
cheaper crappier stuff intelligence is

in summation conferences are very

1071
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,310
important because their places for us to

1072
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,220
get together and be around<font color="#E5E5E5"> like-minded</font>

people I don't do this conference

1074
