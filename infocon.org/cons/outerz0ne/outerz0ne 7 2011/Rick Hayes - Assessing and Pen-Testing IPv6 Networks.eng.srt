1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:11,610
so welcome my talk this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about pen</font>

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,040
testing and performing security

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:20,549
assessments on ipv6 my name is Rick

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:23,009
Hayes I am a security consultant or a

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,789
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna say who but for a</font>

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,230
company I'm also the host of the episode

7
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,970
daily podcast which you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,170
attended last night we certainly thank

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:37,800
you and so I saw one of them one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,590
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was on there but anyways what</font>

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover today is ipv6 and why</font>

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,399
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it matter go through a brief</font>

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,500
overview of ipv6 then talk about

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,539
assessing ipv6 networks and then

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,719
accessing accessing ipv6 networks

16
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:55,739
assessing ipv6 networks and then I was

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a demo but we're probably</font>

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to swing it and just go</font>

19
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:04,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the demo as we do the</font>

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,119
presentation and so just a little

21
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,460
background on how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of whole</font>

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,799
thing got started was I was doing an

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,649
internal assessment at a corporation and

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,270
asked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at their data center so I</font>

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,100
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and said these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the results</font>

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we found he said so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run in map</font>

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,820
scans and find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the boxes that</font>

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,130
you can see and I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have known when</font>

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,439
he said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of a test which</font>

30
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,380
I failed because i only found half the

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,119
boxes so he said he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said show me what</font>

32
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,619
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is</font>

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,630
the listing you know here's all the end

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,150
map results and goes great where's the

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,610
others i said what others he said the

36
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">other boxes he said our Devon and our</font>

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,579
test boxes I said I didn't you give me

38
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,429
the subnet she wanted me to scan and he

39
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,059
said yes he said but I gave you the ipv4

40
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,159
subnet you didn't ask for ipv6 and we

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,530
have an entire half of our data center

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,950
that is running ipv6 because we're

43
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,040
trying to switch over internally I said

44
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:05,009
great let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just fire up some tools and</font>

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,920
see what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find so I tried to fire</font>

46
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,500
up

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,880
some commercial tools to find those

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,989
devices and I failed miserably because

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,140
you don't configure them the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

50
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,610
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work the same way so I asked</font>

51
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,349
him what it was his driver and obviously

52
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,459
we know what the driver is for moving to

53
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,429
ipv6 it's the depletion of the ipv4

54
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,720
minus the horse that are keeping the the

55
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,050
blocks that are allocated to them

56
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,680
there's there's none left unless your

57
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,200
verizon and and other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,880
but as we say that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

59
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,670
transition period so a lot of folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,859
starting to look at ipv6 they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

61
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,690
it internally perhaps not externally but

62
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,340
internally they're doing it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

63
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,620
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to transition so we're in a</font>

64
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,680
period of flux and probably going to be

65
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,840
there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better part of maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to</font>

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 years which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,209
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it that's a really slow</font>

68
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,350
learning curve you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of get</font>

69
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:09,220
ramped up very slowly but the idea is

70
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,140
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what ipv6 usage from the</font>

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,870
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> nessus broadband looked like</font>

72
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,690
circa nineteen ninety nine and you can

73
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,480
see it's not that great<font color="#E5E5E5"> there wasn't a</font>

74
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,920
lot it was mostly geeks and universities

75
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,230
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it and other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people's</font>

76
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing you know research and probably not</font>

77
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,828
even security<font color="#E5E5E5"> research we step forward</font>

78
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:35,709
to 2011 and we can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has grown</font>

79
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:37,750
by leaps and bounds that's not that that

80
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,220
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good transition that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

81
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,670
there when you see going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that to</font>

82
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,040
this that's a coverage area so that

83
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,600
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> said there are a lot of folks that</font>

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,700
have some right targets out there if

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,190
that's what you're into but that are

86
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">running on ipv6 a lot of your customers</font>

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,959
or our customers are running ipv6 and if

88
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't have the knowledge or the tool</font>

89
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,380
set to go out and assess them then we're

90
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,209
missing half the battle so we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

91
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,760
changes going on right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got ipv</font>

92
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv4 only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices we got devices that</font>

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,649
are ipv4 and ipv6 we've got devices that

94
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:16,060
are ipv6 only so the issue is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

95
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,380
change isn't going to happen it's going

96
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font>

97
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,130
hello it should be methodical but you're

98
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start seeing companies doing</font>

99
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,420
they're testing for integrating the ipv6

100
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,980
into their current infrastructure rather

101
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,190
than going out to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketplace and</font>

102
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,370
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to pay some kind of bounty</font>

103
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:38,430
to get a knife you know ipv4 address or

104
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,990
block I can just cheaply do it instead

105
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of changing over if I'm going to change</font>

106
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,160
over anyways why not just go over 26 and

107
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:49,049
be done with it so real quick and again

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I started out not knowing a</font>

109
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,990
whole hell of a lot about ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

110
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,100
figured I can't be the only guy that

111
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,670
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a whole hell of a lot about</font>

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but if if I say anything wrong please</font>

113
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,760
correct me if you know more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I do</font>

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,330
which I'm assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's most of the view</font>

115
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,690
this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rudimentary but I</font>

116
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,370
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> feat ipv6 is obviously the the next</font>

117
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,370
generation is the replacement for ipv4

118
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,930
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed by the IETF and if you</font>

119
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">look and see when it actually came out</font>

120
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,260
it came out in 98 so that's why that map

121
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,580
of 99 becomes important so and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

122
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,349
does with packet switching internet

123
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:28,229
working and to end Datagram transmission

124
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:36,840
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the significant part I pv6 uses</font>

125
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:41,010
128-bit address which supports 2128 I'm

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,280
sorry it supports 2028 networks and so

127
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,360
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 340 unit whatever it's just a</font>

128
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,210
shitload I don't know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pronounce</font>

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,880
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm not going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ipv4</font>

130
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,310
supports about you know four billion and

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,860
so we've already run through those ipv6

132
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,210
eliminates the necessity to have matting

133
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,620
so we got to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting back to like</font>

134
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,909
the old universities or current

135
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,590
universities where everything is a

136
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,180
publicly addressable IP address so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeh</font>

137
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,119
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is we don't have to worry</font>

138
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,330
about the exhaustion of those because by

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,580
the time we exhaust ipv6 will be at v8

140
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,969
and so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continue to start</font>

141
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,320
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the next generation probably</font>

142
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,850
256-bit address and nobody will

143
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,770
certainly be able to remember that so

144
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,169
the days of us being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to say go to</font>

145
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:30,448
you know blank blank that blanked out

146
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,770
blank are over so I say that but yet

147
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:33,419
what was the premise<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it</font>

148
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,389
so they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simplify the the</font>

149
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,990
address assignment so they put in some

150
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,120
mechanisms that allows a device to be

151
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:46,229
able to essentially auto configure

152
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,699
itself unless you're a mac and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

153
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:53,669
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and so it provides for</font>

154
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">network remembering and again all of</font>

155
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is just basic as part of it as part</font>

156
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the RFC but the idea was they wanted</font>

157
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,469
to make sure the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism that they</font>

158
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:04,259
included which was we all know is a

159
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">bolt-on type II before was security so</font>

160
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,770
hip<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC is included in it now a lot of</font>

161
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,698
people you'll see the RFC says it's

162
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:15,150
mandatory but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's actually</font>

163
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,210
recommended you don't have to use IPSec

164
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,120
as part of an ipv6 implementation you

165
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,448
can run things unencrypted and still use

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv6 because what it does is for</font>

167
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,620
backwards compatibility is allows you to

168
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,839
be able to say if a device talks to

169
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:34,110
another device and says sorry I don't

170
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:37,229
speak that lingo meaning if sec then it

171
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,449
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well let's talk plain text and</font>

172
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,859
it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that's fine so all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

173
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:43,800
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is essentially say I don't</font>

174
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to encrypt my data my datagrams and</font>

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,779
it won't do it so one of the significant

176
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,000
changes that came out of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

177
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,259
obviously the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new header format and</font>

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,069
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font>

179
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,360
second the quality of service and then

180
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,099
they added something called neighbor

181
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,789
discovery protocol which is essentially

182
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:05,039
ICMP version 6 but it replaces art so

183
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:09,449
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notion of doing art poisoning is</font>

184
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,490
gone now we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> router discovery</font>

185
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:13,199
messages and redirect messages and some

186
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,639
other multicast and unicast messages

187
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,240
which become fairly important as we

188
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,729
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an ipv6 infrastructure</font>

189
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,149
so just to give you a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparison</font>

190
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:26,758
ipv4 is 32 bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus 128 again you</font>

191
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:29,909
have the auto configuration for ipv4 is

192
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,779
dhcp but you have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp version 6</font>

193
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:35,169
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> optional you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipic</font>

194
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,700
IP version 6

195
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,799
you have the router<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements and</font>

196
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,570
arp is no longer there so you use ICMP

197
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,790
and again you see where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> says</font>

198
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,440
mandatory for ipsec it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

199
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,420
recommended at your EV RFC so this is

200
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">what an ipv6 address looks like it</font>

201
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,630
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any surprise to anyone of</font>

202
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,430
you but there's multiple ways that you

203
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,899
could write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so they figured that all</font>

204
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,569
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeroes we're going to confuse us</font>

205
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,430
so they said hey you could remove the

206
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,899
leading zeros in the 16-bit block

207
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,300
address and you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look like</font>

208
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,149
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you could just go with a double</font>

209
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,760
colon notation and you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of truncate</font>

210
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:16,360
it down so all three of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

211
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,160
legitimate ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses different</font>

212
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,079
operating systems present them

213
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,600
differently to you so it's important for

214
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:27,010
you to know how about how those work the

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,519
all three of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this all three of</font>

216
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:36,939
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same exact IP address so</font>

217
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,769
on a configuration ipv6 hosts with the

218
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:42,610
exceptions of max can auto configure

219
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,199
themselves to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv6 address so</font>

220
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,300
what they do is they use a router

221
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,329
discovery message message which is what

222
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually is required and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

223
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:54,279
implements that but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is</font>

224
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,949
if it doesn't receive a message back

225
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:02,079
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a router it says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to find a</font>

226
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:04,329
DHCP 6v6 server if I don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then</font>

227
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,899
i say i have no capability of assigning

228
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:10,029
myself an IP address so if you set your

229
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,690
mac or you know any any system to using

230
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv6 and you say automatic go and see if</font>

231
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,890
it get you an IP address if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not</font>

232
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,540
have a router that says this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

233
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:24,310
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using because it has no</font>

234
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">concept of what the local link is so</font>

235
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,989
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> going into IPSec the same thing</font>

236
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:32,050
for ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> applies that was you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

237
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:34,449
relevant ipv4 it provides that whole CI

238
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,849
a confidential company g<font color="#CCCCCC"> ality data</font>

239
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:39,370
integrity the one thing it does provide

240
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,230
is the authentication so you can

241
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,959
actually go through if it's enabled on

242
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,160
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and both sides agree to it you can</font>

243
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,258
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

244
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,639
are you the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sent me this packet</font>

245
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,680
I can validate that you're the one that

246
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent it to me so you I mean think about</font>

247
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,560
that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man-in-the-middle</font>

248
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,250
perspective that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes the</font>

249
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:00,399
paradigm a little bit if you have anti

250
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,439
replay again I can't do a packet capture

251
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,250
and just replay those package back over

252
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:07,779
because I can then go and verify that

253
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,100
those packets were unique and they

254
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:14,620
weren't duplicated they haven't been

255
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out on the wire before so this is</font>

256
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">the significant change now when you</font>

257
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,258
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ipv4 header everybody's</font>

258
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,389
seen those we've seen them hundreds of

259
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:24,189
times so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's nothing new but</font>

260
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,110
the fact of the matter is everything

261
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in yellow on that and unless</font>

262
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,550
you're colorblind I will kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pointed</font>

263
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,500
out it's those those are actually the

264
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,389
ones that are carried<font color="#E5E5E5"> over because they</font>

265
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,199
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep them the same form ipv4</font>

266
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to v6 so you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

267
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:42,040
significantly changed in the sense that

268
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,310
it's more simplistic so they achieved

269
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,870
what they wanted to so they didn't

270
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,518
include a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other stuff and</font>

271
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,350
there is some the flow label we talked

272
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:51,970
about quality of service that's the

273
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,430
actual flow label that will go into that

274
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,790
particular part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the header so I</font>

275
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,239
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about icmpv6 again it's defined</font>

276
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,250
by RFC 2463 this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a packet</font>

277
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,500
looks like so you see the previous ipv6

278
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,310
header you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ipv6 payload</font>

279
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,019
compared to what you would have down so

280
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,439
that payload that is going to consist of

281
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:17,759
an ICMP v6 header and that message is

282
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:23,430
all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the ipv6 payload I</font>

283
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:28,029
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say v6 versus IP so the</font>

284
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,769
ICMP v6 provides a multicast listener

285
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,360
discovery and neighbor discovery and

286
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,439
that multicast listener discovery kind

287
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,300
of becomes important but the neighbor

288
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:36,519
discovery is extremely important because

289
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,639
it tells you what who's your neighbor

290
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,279
who's on the same wire that I am and

291
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:47,430
what that defines is I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crossing a</font>

292
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:50,529
router that's what that's defined as so

293
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,969
and again it replaces igmp for those of

294
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:53,630
you that are interested but it also

295
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,400
makes sure that it has your

296
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,110
ship management for the multicast

297
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,370
segments you're going to be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

298
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,440
know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of us that are used to</font>

299
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,970
dealing with multicast nothing's really

300
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,470
changed assist the addresses have

301
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,600
changed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the new v6</font>

302
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,470
multicast looks like so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

303
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:16,090
paint everybody I actually contain this

304
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:19,160
address right here FF 0 2 colon colon 1

305
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:22,400
now if i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see all of the routers</font>

306
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,490
that are on there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> FF 0 2 colon</font>

307
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,910
colon 2 so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

308
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,140
can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is sorry this is kind</font>

309
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,510
of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can just ping that</font>

310
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,340
address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have done I've essentially</font>

311
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:40,430
done a pink sweep of everybody on that

312
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:42,350
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will all reply back I'm here so</font>

313
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,569
neighbor discovery it determines the

314
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,800
link layer addressing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it does is</font>

315
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,630
think about it it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that I</font>

316
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a duplicate address you're</font>

317
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,470
not going to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same v6 address</font>

318
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,870
that I have it's also going to make sure

319
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i know of the routers that are out</font>

320
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,110
there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

321
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,370
know all of the neighbors when they come

322
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,410
up when when they come down<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font>

323
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,060
announce themselves of doing so now when

324
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,130
they go down if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like a hard</font>

325
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,270
crash they just won't be there but

326
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally when they're being shut down</font>

327
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,319
there nice they send out hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm</font>

328
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,240
going away I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going bye-bye I'm not</font>

329
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,990
going to be here one of the things that

330
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,720
the icmpv6 actually has those five main

331
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,670
package which is a router solicitation

332
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,860
who's the router out their router

333
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,870
advertisements I'm the router neighbor

334
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,180
solicitation who's my neighbor and again

335
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,980
advertisements yeah I'm your neighbor

336
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,750
trust me and of course then the

337
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,920
redirects and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again the redirects</font>

338
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the same thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen from</font>

339
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,380
before so we talked about dns and this

340
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,319
is where it actually becomes kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

341
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:43,210
interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a records</font>

342
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,590
now with v6 we have quad a records I

343
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,000
don't know why they got some original

344
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,160
that they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out with quad a but</font>

345
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,630
still and we have the point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> records</font>

346
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:55,069
or the reverse records that are exactly

347
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:58,520
the same so a lot of applications right

348
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:02,430
now rely from a v6 perspective rely on

349
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS so they're going to query a hostname</font>

350
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:07,680
so that's problematic if you think about

351
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,899
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say I need to see what's</font>

352
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there so I'm going to say hey send</font>

353
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,990
me all of the you know neighbor

354
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,579
solicitation who's my neighbor talked to

355
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,880
me and they all tell you and you're like

356
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,130
cool now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you but all I</font>

357
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,810
all I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been given is your v6 address I</font>

358
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,399
don't know who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are because it</font>

359
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,930
doesn't announce that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host name in</font>

360
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,730
that so accessing how do you access now

361
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,370
in a local subnet it was fairly easy i

362
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,750
just plugged into an rj45 jack and Bob's

363
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,850
your uncle I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their network if</font>

364
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:42,200
you're wondering what operating systems

365
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:46,170
support it that's the ton that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

366
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:51,180
most of them by default and some of them

367
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,829
support them ipv6 better than others but

368
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,099
for the majority of them if you think

369
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:59,279
about Windows 2008 it's enabled by

370
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,230
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 by default keep going down the</font>

371
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,709
list of all of the ones that it's

372
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,260
enabled ubuntu all of its on by default

373
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:14,459
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing or the scary</font>

374
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:15,600
thing is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go and i actually so how</font>

375
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,540
do you enable it so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

376
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,600
you basically you can on a mac and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

377
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,240
is very just matched mac specific so

378
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,380
essentially it's going to I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

379
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,839
through and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it that I</font>

380
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add it to all okay now I've</font>

381
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,360
already done it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's going to come</font>

382
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,400
back with an error but you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

383
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,050
I've got there now if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

384
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">firewall list and this is by default</font>

385
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,949
have not changed it does that look good

386
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,029
to anybody and I don't know if you can

387
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:45,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'll read it it's all 65535</font>

388
00:16:42,029 --> 00:16:48,329
ports allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> from any to any that's the</font>

389
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:50,490
default firewall rule that's when if

390
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:55,199
you're if you're on our side it's bad if

391
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not so so that being said there's</font>

392
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,510
some fail built into this so if you have

393
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:04,079
an is box and you've set up rule sets

394
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,809
for ipv4 you have to do the same thing

395
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,559
for ipv6 and they're not the same

396
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,559
commands

397
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,819
so if you're from coming in from an

398
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet perspective you don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font>

399
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,980
you don't have a provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP that does</font>

400
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,140
it what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do go to hurricane</font>

401
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,579
electric get you go go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broker</font>

402
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,550
there's tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them out there that</font>

403
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,290
support i say<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons there's three but</font>

404
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,169
they're geographically dispersed so

405
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,690
there's tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess geographically but</font>

406
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,610
you just go it's free this one's free

407
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,640
you can register they ask for your

408
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,610
publicly facing IP address and that's it

409
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,550
there's clients out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now here</font>

410
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,530
they are so go go<font color="#CCCCCC"> six free net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

411
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,570
they're actually cool except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

412
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:53,530
only part is they only cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> Montreal am</font>

413
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,139
stern am Taipei and Sydney but damn they

414
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,730
got a great ass client that works well

415
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,520
so what do they support<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and 24 which</font>

416
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,440
is ipv6 and 24 and four into six which

417
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,970
is ipv4 which is what we would want we

418
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,370
would want our four networks to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

419
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,070
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network hurricane</font>

420
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,620
electric covers the US and again it

421
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:16,179
supports well US Canada Europe Hong Kong

422
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:18,760
Tokyo maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so much Singapore in it</font>

423
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:22,180
does six under four<font color="#E5E5E5"> and six is also does</font>

424
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,250
a US brazil in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe and that's a six</font>

425
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,360
end 24 so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what you're</font>

426
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,940
looking for from an external perspective

427
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,889
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to assess a customer and you</font>

428
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,830
don't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> capability get a broker</font>

429
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,830
it's fairly easy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eula allows you to</font>

430
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,240
do that in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them include the</font>

431
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,010
tools right on their websites to be able

432
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to assess which ports are open on a VIP</font>

433
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,140
v6 network or internet facing system

434
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,940
because they're assuming it's a regular

435
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:52,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">laptop or something else that's public</font>

436
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:55,480
facing so assessing an ipv6 network so

437
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,700
where the rubber meets the road so when

438
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,050
we normally do a v4 reconnaissance

439
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,970
normally when we do reconnaissance we

440
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,940
say hey just run a ping sweep and find

441
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,540
out what's alive and go through that or

442
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,700
we may do a full port scan you know all

443
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,020
65535<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp and same thing you know so we</font>

444
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,320
may do all of that to find out what's

445
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,060
out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds great we can see</font>

446
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,230
which ones don't respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a pain we</font>

447
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,560
can go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole myriad of</font>

448
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,380
things in a v6 environment you can't do

449
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,409
that because essentially you

450
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,630
be sending whatever that equates to it's

451
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,820
a ton because it's like wait it's

452
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,920
so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros it's not even funny the</font>

453
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,960
point being it's not feasible to do in a

454
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">pink sweep of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entire v6 network</font>

455
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,650
because guess what if their routing that

456
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,870
you're also talking to internet-facing

457
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,100
systems you're talking to universities

458
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:47,439
and other folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are running v6 so</font>

459
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,679
that doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out what's alive</font>

460
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,670
is problematic as you can well imagine

461
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,110
which is kind of what I ran into so

462
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,360
quickly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a droid without the customer</font>

463
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,030
knowing i went and found out how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

464
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,949
discover what's out there well looks

465
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,410
like you can go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can query</font>

466
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:07,450
those quad a records but you have to

467
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,850
know the dns server to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to query</font>

468
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,070
them well that kind of sucks you have to

469
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,740
know the IP IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i</font>

470
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:17,080
didn't know that and for the most part

471
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,790
everyone of the all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this required dns</font>

472
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,260
because even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to</font>

473
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,740
start with a hostname and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work</font>

474
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,970
backwards and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

475
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,240
so I started looking at some other recon

476
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:30,160
tools out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping six so you can use</font>

477
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,980
ping six its installed by default on

478
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,980
backtrack and I think a bunt to Mac has

479
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,040
it you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a pink</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

480
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,740
version with a windows box paying works

481
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,970
on the ipv6 just natively it works on v4

482
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,380
or v6 so you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> n mount and maps</font>

483
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,790
kind of quirky though and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

484
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about that in a few seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

485
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:55,320
use a half scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> six the v6 version of it</font>

486
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:59,590
metasploit netcat<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cat so cat and then</font>

487
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,909
the THC ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked toolkit that's the</font>

488
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,139
mack daddy that's the one you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

489
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,030
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it's not included by default</font>

490
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,210
on backtrack so you got to download it

491
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,680
install it which can be problematic if

492
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,940
you don't want a customer to know that

493
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,230
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so that's why we're</font>

494
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,240
having this talk so you'll know to have

495
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,990
your tools a hit you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> together ahead</font>

496
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:21,760
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time pain six does exactly what it</font>

497
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,410
says it paint and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

498
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,550
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to know the the address</font>

499
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,140
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pinger the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname</font>

500
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,440
and again if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hostname it has</font>

501
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,899
to have

502
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,840
v6 resolvers so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS has to come into</font>

503
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">play but you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that i can actually</font>

504
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,370
kind of trick it i can say i want to

505
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,519
paying all of those remember that FF 0 2

506
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:44,350
colon colon or colon colon one we talked

507
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier for the multicast if i</font>

508
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,330
peeing that it tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> which ones are</font>

509
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
alive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have every one of these and</font>

510
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,710
you can see it's sequentially doing two

511
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,940
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a third one pops in so</font>

512
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:04,379
i have that just to ignore the fe 80 but

513
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:07,360
20 c 21 f & a 6 e d that pops in there

514
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:08,799
so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> tells me how many duplicates again</font>

515
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,719
because remember we talked about the

516
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,429
fact that saying how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

517
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,789
talked about replay so it actually knows

518
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:19,210
and it uses that capability in map and

519
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:21,399
map has some limitations it's a great

520
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely love it but the only</font>

521
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:27,000
thing that it's a limiter about it is it

522
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,559
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does TCP connect that kind of blows</font>

523
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,120
you could do a pink scanned you can do a

524
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,678
list scanned you can do version

525
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,149
detection it does all of the other stuff

526
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:40,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would think it does let's go</font>

527
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:42,428
here so if i run a in map on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it well</font>

528
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,960
here's a here's a here's one that I ran

529
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,960
just like a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes ago but</font>

530
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,529
essentially all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing is telling it</font>

531
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:54,250
that I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run a visa you know v6 so</font>

532
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I put a dash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do tcp I tell</font>

533
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,190
it I don't need you to get a response<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

534
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:02,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume the box is dead okay and then in</font>

535
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,669
that case then it does the the port

536
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,460
mapping and it comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tells me</font>

537
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">those the interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I run</font>

538
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,570
that and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that way</font>

539
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:12,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that in a second so that's</font>

540
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:19,720
the actual results that we would see on

541
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:21,759
windows 2003 box<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I have yes this</font>

542
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,090
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing this is a metasploit</font>

543
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:29,139
able box<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think yes so if i do a</font>

544
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:33,699
comparison between a v6 and a v4 scan

545
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:35,110
and this is a 1025 132 versus the v6 can

546
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,369
you see the difference if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't i</font>

547
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,889
pointed them out for you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took</font>

548
00:23:36,369 --> 00:23:40,110
me a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to figure it out</font>

549
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,910
there's some changes why because there's

550
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:44,070
rule sets that are set on there by

551
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,720
default that allow certain things to

552
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,510
work and certain things not to work if I

553
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,240
hadn't allowed those so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key one is I</font>

554
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,640
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a web server if I'm looking</font>

555
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it from a v6 perspective so I can't</font>

556
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,610
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> a web server by a v6 the same</font>

557
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,950
thing can be true inversely I could also

558
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,709
have services that are available on a v4

559
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,390
network and then I'm sorry on a v6

560
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,690
network that are not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

561
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,220
presented on a visa vie for network so

562
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,560
think about if<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody's trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

563
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,720
cute see an opera skate or hide what

564
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,280
they're doing by putting in on v6 and

565
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:25,220
thinking nobody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that ftp</font>

566
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:28,050
server you can find it so half scan<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

567
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:30,270
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can you know look at it it's</font>

568
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,879
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good product does sin</font>

569
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,650
port scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it starts from zero</font>

570
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,500
goes all the way down through unless you

571
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,760
specify a range so it'll just tell you

572
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,030
it's timed out and keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep</font>

573
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,620
going and then it reports what's open so

574
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,570
I think in map does a better job but

575
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,389
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> for completeness just to cover all</font>

576
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,899
the v6 native tools that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

577
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,750
metasploit it supports native natively

578
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,230
supports v6 if the stack below it has v6

579
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,720
enabled so if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have v6 enabled</font>

580
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,010
on a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what you can run into</font>

581
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,840
you're blue in the face it's going to

582
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to give you some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruby errors</font>

583
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,560
and some other stuff and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

584
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google it's going to say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

585
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,030
resolved in an older version and and

586
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,400
then you realize oh yeah that's right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

587
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,470
just able to ipv6 on that box because I

588
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,330
didn't think I needed it so you got to

589
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,490
go make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you re-enable it on your</font>

590
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,340
test box one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that actually</font>

591
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:28,020
does is it uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> art so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're thinking</font>

592
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,850
whoa ipv6 doesn't use art well one of

593
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,950
the things that actually does require in

594
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:34,379
some of these is it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

595
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,300
require that you have an ipv4 address

596
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">added in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll see it in a</font>

597
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:41,340
second so for a local host you can put

598
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,139
in a v4 or v6 address for the remote

599
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,490
host you can put in a four or six and I

600
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,110
say

601
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">six</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sometimes and you'll see why in</font>

602
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:51,949
a minute so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is include include some</font>

603
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,710
discovery modules so it does the the

604
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,870
local<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping discovery so I can see who's</font>

605
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,540
out there using the multicast I can do a

606
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,090
neighbor discovery and I can see who you

607
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the router of</font>

608
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:07,870
advertisements I can see who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

609
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:13,660
routers out there so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

610
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:17,178
jump back over<font color="#CCCCCC"> heat up all right so</font>

611
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,580
remember I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it uses art so it's</font>

612
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,890
discovering the addresses via ARP and

613
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,020
then it says it compares those are

614
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,390
actually says do you have an ipv6

615
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,830
address can you tell me what it is so

616
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,450
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

617
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,629
you're actually running the ipv6

618
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:35,240
neighbor discovery kind of cheating in a

619
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:40,370
way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were to change this and</font>

620
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:49,700
you were to set it to a mature you were

621
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:54,610
to set it to a no come on alright so the

622
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,610
demo gods are failing me<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there it is</font>

623
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,889
so you can change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

624
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,309
multicast address right so if you were

625
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:06,830
to do that and this shit's got some lag

626
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:08,809
in it essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is it</font>

627
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,949
returns nothing it tells you it found

628
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,010
the host but it doesn't return your

629
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:15,890
information so see if I captured that

630
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,420
because I knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might happen so</font>

631
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,340
here's what it looks like when it says

632
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,460
hey I found some stuff by art this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

633
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,169
what it looks like and so then it says I

634
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:28,820
found those two IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

635
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:31,490
map out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this I guess I didn't egg so</font>

636
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:35,840
we'll work on getting that work so in

637
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:38,660
cat it's the end map version so or<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

638
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,820
so it's the end map version i guess of

639
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:44,120
net cat is the one that supports v6

640
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:46,070
natively so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing i</font>

641
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,870
can do a banner grab I can do whatever I

642
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,149
want I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to specify it now the</font>

643
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,489
one quirk here is you have to specify

644
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:54,140
the interface address which becomes

645
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,100
important especially when you're dealing

646
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,680
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> max</font>

647
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,209
virtual machines and other devices it

648
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,480
changes so you got to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

649
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,060
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of what you're dealing with</font>

650
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,840
so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually grab that you can do</font>

651
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing you can do a you know I</font>

652
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,639
get or whatever you want for our head

653
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,020
for HTTP server find out what it is and

654
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:23,110
it'll show you all of that and i think

655
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:27,670
i've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example yeah so here we just</font>

656
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">run in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mcat and we're running it against</font>

657
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,780
a web server which is running tomcat and

658
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:36,130
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially if everything works it</font>

659
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:37,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">should come back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should say the</font>

660
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,840
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're seeing you up here</font>

661
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,840
but

662
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:54,530
yay so it returns a 200 so everything's

663
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay tells me the server if it was an</font>

664
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:59,870
IAS box it would return more information

665
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,480
but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with with tomcat on</font>

666
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,820
this so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

667
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,360
thing as what we've already seen and

668
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:11,299
we're used to and then you've got netcat

669
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">six which is NC 60 versus running NC you</font>

670
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:16,309
have to run in<font color="#CCCCCC"> c 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it does the same</font>

671
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:19,610
exact thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the difference here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

672
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:20,990
nc6 actually supports v4 and v6 so you

673
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,780
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch back and forth you just have</font>

674
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:25,490
to specify it now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't specify</font>

675
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:28,370
it'll actually try<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and then it will</font>

676
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:30,620
try six kind of interesting so cat

677
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,449
native tool that supports v6 it's a

678
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">great tool if you got tools that don't</font>

679
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:41,750
support natively v6 or they say they do

680
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,590
you can use so cat to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to use</font>

681
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:48,730
a tool that is not natively support that

682
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:52,040
nikto so what I've essentially got is a

683
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,070
show cat listener here that is listening

684
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:59,928
on port 8888 it's redirecting it using

685
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:02,389
v6 over to the windows box using port 80

686
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:06,400
via the ethernet interface ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 so</font>

687
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:08,660
its use the east 0 and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can rerun</font>

688
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,309
Nick<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and essentially all intelligence</font>

689
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,610
the host is my localhost and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

690
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,830
have it scanned port 8888 or 888 which

691
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:20,389
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially going to redirect it over</font>

692
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:23,030
to the windows box using v6 because

693
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:27,169
nikto doesn't sport v6 natively doesn't

694
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,280
know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

695
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:30,679
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and it should give me some</font>

696
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,110
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell me yeah this is</font>

697
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,880
what it is and of course I've got the

698
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,070
screen up above<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I knew this was</font>

699
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,190
going to happen so but it identified it

700
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,990
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache coyote one dot one tells</font>

701
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,490
me the target for granted that doesn't

702
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,650
match up but still you can you could

703
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,860
document this very easily to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show I ran</font>

704
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:51,710
this tool i targeted this particular

705
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,959
tool against your box using so cat take

706
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:56,620
two screenshots you're done move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

707
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:01,210
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> target so</font>

708
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:04,090
uh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's great for tunneling so then</font>

709
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,710
we come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the THC ipv6 attack tool kit</font>

710
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,649
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking awesome set of tools</font>

711
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,940
I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like if if you don't grab</font>

712
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything grab this so a live six very</font>

713
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,850
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run it it'll say hey tell me</font>

714
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,640
who's out there so it actually has them

715
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,959
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a solicitation for a neighbor</font>

716
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,440
solicitation and a router solicitation

717
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,150
tell me who's out there who's alive so

718
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,330
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple comes back returns it</font>

719
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,400
all to you detect new says you can run

720
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,010
that and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will show you when a v6</font>

721
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,620
device comes online start that in a

722
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,940
window throw it aside kind of just keep

723
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,469
it up that way you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

724
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:46,390
something pops up now you can you can

725
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:50,050
generate neighbor solicitation request

726
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:52,870
using send<font color="#E5E5E5"> PS teen is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you want a</font>

727
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:56,230
hand craft stuff trace is just a version

728
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:58,000
traceroute them for v6 so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font>

729
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,620
live the command line looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

730
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,450
allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run some stuff you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

731
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,459
you know output all of this which is

732
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:06,120
great because if you're trying to show

733
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:12,210
this for a customer it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

734
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,209
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sooo</font>

735
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:31,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey so that one returned so let me pop</font>

736
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:31,370
up a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> window damn this is slow</font>

737
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:35,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

738
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,100
so this is whatever this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what they</font>

739
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like after you get done building it</font>

740
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,010
and I hate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's green but I do it</font>

741
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,780
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation purposes so the</font>

742
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,960
customer didn't have to pronounce it's

743
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,370
all white kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looks cool but anyways</font>

744
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,780
essentially what are all the sets of

745
00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:02,540
tools and so if I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> run a live six I</font>

746
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,460
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I can also tell it that I</font>

747
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,399
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interface what's</font>

748
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,210
hanging off of this and so it'll

749
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,200
actually start telling me what's alive

750
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,679
down here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing I had to</font>

751
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,420
specify was my interface so it tells me

752
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">I has one system alive which should be</font>

753
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:26,360
correct because that's the one box we've

754
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:27,500
been screwing with commercial tools this

755
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,110
is funny when you start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

756
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,240
commercial tools to support ipv6 read

757
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,270
the fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> print I'm put it actually</font>

758
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,309
supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> nessa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supports it but Nessus</font>

759
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,929
you have to give it an interface well if

760
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,280
you're running Nessus on a windows box

761
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:47,990
what's your interface name does anyone

762
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:52,850
know I'm sorry you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it the</font>

763
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:55,130
whole thing which sucks so if you're

764
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:57,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">running on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux box it significantly</font>

765
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:01,160
easier it's just like f1e to what every

766
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:04,129
0 open bass has had support next<font color="#CCCCCC"> pose as</font>

767
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,710
had support st. all of these support

768
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,050
them supposedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> native they're very</font>

769
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,310
quirky they don't necessarily return the

770
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,609
results you think you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

771
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say this from a web inspector</font>

772
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:19,040
spective if you think that you're going

773
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:22,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be to be able to run the tickle</font>

774
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,949
injector wrong then sported the tool

775
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:27,440
itself supports you know web inspect as

776
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:29,000
a whole supports it sequel injector does

777
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,869
not because it's a separate tool it

778
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,359
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been coded for it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if</font>

779
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:38,570
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's great HTTP</font>

780
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,009
editor doesn't work have fun that's not

781
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,659
going to work for you you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

782
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a lot of these tools that say they</font>

783
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,240
support it there's little quirky issues

784
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:50,209
core impact supports it but it supports

785
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,469
finding vulnerabilities not necessarily

786
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:53,800
in exploiting them it doesn't

787
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,899
necessarily support all of the things

788
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,850
you would think that it would so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

789
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,290
I know the and of course they have

790
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,509
listed vulnerabilities and this is what

791
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">we look for if you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

792
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:07,380
underlying v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> tak it doesn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

793
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,570
exploitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if we start talking</font>

794
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:16,180
about exploitation one of the things

795
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:18,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at is stuff that's</font>

796
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,109
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> pacific and so again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we kind of go</font>

797
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,120
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we've got the</font>

798
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,490
framework for<font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit we've got the</font>

799
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,160
attack tool kit we've got commercial

800
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,479
tools we've got a four to six so if

801
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,490
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at internet and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

802
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,050
got soaked<font color="#E5E5E5"> adam i actually prefer to use</font>

803
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,000
so cap for just about everything because

804
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,400
it's so freaking easy just target the

805
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,590
box start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the ports you want</font>

806
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,000
run your tools tell it you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

807
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:43,900
essentially tart you know target

808
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,240
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be done with it so the</font>

809
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,620
attack tool kit comes with some pretty

810
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,839
interesting things parasite<font color="#E5E5E5"> six so it's</font>

811
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,089
a neighbor solicitation neighbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

812
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertisement spoofer so if you're</font>

813
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking art days that it's a</font>

814
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:03,190
man-in-the-middle type of attack you can

815
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:07,750
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody hey I'm your neighbor once</font>

816
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:10,860
you be my neighbor remember we talked

817
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:14,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the significance of dns and and</font>

818
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:17,470
from a v6 perspective one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

819
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:19,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is and I and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

820
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,149
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this as a course of a</font>

821
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,830
reconnaissance is<font color="#E5E5E5"> will brute force dns</font>

822
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,330
servers externally to see what we can

823
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:28,180
get what names are you not you know

824
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,880
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that we can find well there's</font>

825
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:34,540
a dns dick<font color="#CCCCCC"> six which that just sounded</font>

826
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,730
wrong but dipped six that that

827
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,970
essentially is a dns brute forcer does a

828
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,190
dictionary attack against the dns server

829
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:45,310
so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking fierce too it's</font>

830
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:47,860
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that only not as cool but</font>

831
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,090
it still does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the job fake router</font>

832
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,650
announcement this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually my</font>

833
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,770
favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the sense that you can</font>

834
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:57,340
announce that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're of the router for a</font>

835
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:59,440
local net and so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> their v4 traffic is</font>

836
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> netherlands and having</font>

837
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,130
fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the v6</font>

838
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,559
traffic coming straight to you the

839
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,140
interesting thing is

840
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:10,749
445 traffic 139 traffic all of that it's

841
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:13,058
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> active on v6 so while they may be</font>

842
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:15,218
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you most tools can see you</font>

843
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:17,679
on a v4 network they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see</font>

844
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,829
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so if I've attacked</font>

845
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:24,009
domain controllers before or try to grab

846
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:27,249
credentials that's a perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do</font>

847
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:30,400
it think about the evilness of that

848
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:31,928
somebody's sitting there going well we

849
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,939
can see you if you're actually doing

850
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:35,739
this because we're monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4</font>

851
00:37:33,939 --> 00:37:38,529
network and people are experiencing a

852
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:40,209
slowdown or a lag and authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

853
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:42,069
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that's doing</font>

854
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:44,038
that who maybe I'm not the one doing

855
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:46,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I wouldn't be grabbing credentials</font>

856
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,439
but in this case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

857
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,199
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not going to be aware</font>

858
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:52,449
of it but all of that authentications

859
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:54,789
traffic will still try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use v4 and v6</font>

860
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:59,609
if the domain controllers use it now

861
00:37:54,789 --> 00:38:02,589
think about native 2008 it's not hard so

862
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,029
reader so you can redirect traffic again

863
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:05,739
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another man in the</font>

redirect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular traffic all</font>

867
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:14,439
that ACH traffic needs to come to me

868
00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:18,549
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> I absolutely have to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HDH</font>

00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:24,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually scans for ipv6 vulnerabilities</font>

871
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:25,539
in the stack itself so there are

872
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:29,199
vulnerabilities and what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

873
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks for so it's a cool little it's a</font>

874
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,219
cool set of tools you can see that

875
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done their homework and added a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot they've also got a fuzzer so if</font>

877
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:40,719
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a buzzer which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

878
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:43,448
of led<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that whole thing about web</font>

879
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:46,390
inspect not working if you find a v6

880
00:38:43,449 --> 00:38:49,509
website and you want to fuzz it good

881
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,859
luck if you're talking you know you know

882
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:52,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have a tool that works on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

883
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:55,839
so you have to switch over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can</font>

884
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:58,479
use that buzzer then you got some other

885
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff so the implementation that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

886
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:02,348
some checks some sanity checks and make

887
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:04,599
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your implementation or a given</font>

888
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:07,479
implementation on a boxes is actually

889
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,179
correct so you've got another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which</font>

890
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:13,629
is fake MLD which is the multicast so it

891
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:16,390
says hey this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new multicast group</font>

892
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,920
would you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join me so you or or</font>

893
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,270
more

894
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,490
gordon lee i'm a member of that

895
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,310
multicast which i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not actually</font>

896
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:25,080
a member of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I am I can</font>

897
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,730
actually say yes i'm a member of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

898
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,960
you can see where the sanity checks and

899
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,920
those vulnerabilities that we talked

900
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,630
about in v6 actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist and again so</font>

901
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go through you can generate fake</font>

902
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:42,080
router messages so there's there's a lot

903
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:46,700
of tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually like the the fake em</font>

904
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:49,740
ipv6 so you can borrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile ipv6</font>

905
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,230
address assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if zach is not</font>

906
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,810
needed for authentication but you can

907
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:57,330
you can borrow it kind of cool i guess

908
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,590
v6 or I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I guess thinking</font>

910
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,390
nefariously I don't want to use my v6

911
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:06,390
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else's so</font>

912
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:11,069
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to borrow theirs while while I</font>

913
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:15,270
do this bo woods mobile attacking type

914
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:17,160
of fake advertiser i can announce myself

915
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,710
on the network i can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm on</font>

916
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,779
another network or this one again<font color="#E5E5E5"> smurf</font>

917
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:26,070
six are six you got the local version in

918
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the remote version the the remote</font>

919
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,430
version only works against<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux at the</font>

920
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,370
moment but they have said that they're

921
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:38,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update that I think in months</font>

922
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">so metasploit so metasploit in addition</font>

923
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we how do you run it because I</font>

924
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:46,140
mean you know natively you can you can

925
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,770
run metasploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> against ipv6 just by</font>

926
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:52,950
giving it the actual our host value of

927
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,300
that v6 box you're trying to target but

928
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,450
they've included are there some other

929
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,070
modules and and one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got</font>

930
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,899
checked in like four days ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

931
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,540
is vicious when you think about it if

932
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have v6 natively installed on</font>

933
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:10,020
your box specifically windows it'll

934
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:13,290
install it it sets of static v6 address

935
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,320
on it then it creates a bind a blunt a

936
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,790
bind she'll pay load and then installs

937
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,550
that as a service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> says it to auto</font>

938
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:25,650
run now you know the address when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

939
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,330
created it so obviously what's it going

940
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,830
to do

941
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,900
it's going to give you a portal back

942
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,850
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's pretty damn cool</font>

943
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,900
because most people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never even see</font>

944
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:40,009
that so then again you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font>

945
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,140
sports that are included<font color="#E5E5E5"> all work Oh 60</font>

946
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:45,920
40 works just as good on before as it

947
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,200
does on v6 so don't forget to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

948
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,770
when you're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to map out the v6</font>

949
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,169
networks to look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey let me</font>

950
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">try this and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why that becomes</font>

951
00:41:54,170 --> 00:42:01,190
important is because as you start moving

952
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">down or as you start moving within a</font>

953
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,870
network most folks have like IPS is I

954
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,120
sensors whatever out there that they're

955
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">using to monitor your activities and</font>

956
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,600
maybe be blocking or stripping out some

957
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,000
of the payloads especially with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

958
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:18,140
the the more advanced IPS is out there

959
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,200
so in this one particular case involving

960
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,900
that data center the the folks had an

961
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,640
IPS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was only looking at v4 traffic</font>

962
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,510
because that's all it was capable of

963
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:33,940
seeing so v6 traffic was allowed to pass

964
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:36,110
natively unfiltered didn't do anything

965
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,910
so while I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

966
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,530
shell and was getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty frustrated</font>

967
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,319
on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boxes when you start</font>

968
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,240
switching over to v6 and trying it lo

969
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,210
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> behold what happens you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a shell</font>

970
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">returned to you so it's there's nothing</font>

971
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">better when you starts knew it you know</font>

972
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,890
sessions you know sessions you know I

973
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,530
one and all sudden you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Windows</font>

974
00:42:54,890 --> 00:43:00,589
prompt there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's it's a good</font>

975
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:04,480
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it now kind of been doing the</font>

976
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:07,010
demo as we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along so I</font>

977
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,020
guess to kind of bring this full circle

978
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,900
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got is</font>

979
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,930
most organizations have a crap ton of v6

980
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,390
traffic out there think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

981
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:19,960
boxes that are out there that were in

982
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,339
those operating systems that I listed

983
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,180
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them by default have turned</font>

984
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,180
off v6

985
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,549
almost none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them now think about your</font>

986
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,109
IT admins that and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say</font>

987
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,520
anything disparaging about IT admins

988
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,770
because they do a wonderful job in most

989
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,509
companies but think about the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

990
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,520
are struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get systems deployed</font>

991
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,369
or build an image do they necessarily

992
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">disable v6 on those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so you may have</font>

993
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:50,020
targets of opportunity sitting there

994
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:52,180
that you're never aware of so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font>

995
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,360
you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it you've got windows 7</font>

996
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,740
vista to a lesser degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

997
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,960
very many corporations that are running

998
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,089
vista but you got windows seven you got

999
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,710
server away you've got max out there

1000
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,390
that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may not have it now if they</font>

1001
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,550
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP or a router that can give</font>

1002
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,710
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local link then absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1003
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:11,860
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local address it'll be auto</font>

1004
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:15,790
assign linux and solaris they all ship

1005
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:18,250
with it enabled by default and they all

1006
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,520
do auto configuration again that's why I

1007
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:23,530
caveated the max because it's the one

1008
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,900
quirky it's the prima donna that has to

1009
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">be different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than you know but the other</font>

1010
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,110
ones by default will get it an address

1011
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,330
so if you can tell you say tell me who's

1012
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:35,980
alive then you can find them you can

1013
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">find them you can target them tunneling</font>

1014
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:43,390
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that if you're</font>

1015
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:45,009
looking at so we did a talk it what was

1016
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:49,810
the was the talk that was here in

1017
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:53,020
Atlanta no not shook on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one</font>

1018
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:54,490
that besides don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why it's cape me</font>

1019
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,920
besides and we talked about data

1020
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:58,240
exfiltration and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks have</font>

1021
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,590
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some research on data exfiltration</font>

1022
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,069
and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we actually</font>

1023
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:05,650
kind of looked at was tunneling traffic

1024
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:09,810
using v6 would it be allowed if I had a

1025
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:13,600
Torito or a six to four or I had my own

1026
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:17,170
broker could I do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah you can</font>

1027
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,690
most most folks wouldn't see it DNS

1028
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:23,070
traffic on port 53 is very rarely looked

1029
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:27,670
at ipv6 traffic being tunneled over port

1030
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:29,460
353 is very rarely looked at so yeah it

1031
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,210
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done for data exfiltration</font>

1032
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,000
another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be</font>

1033
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:36,570
concerned with is<font color="#CCCCCC"> if if you're tunneling</font>

1034
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,790
traffic does that traffic

1035
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,350
include any type of encryption remember

1036
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,410
we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's recommended</font>

1037
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:47,310
but you can use and in encryption if

1038
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:48,359
sack and a v6 tunnel so that's

1039
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,130
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start thinking</font>

1040
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 tunnel</font>

1041
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,170
between me and my house I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can suck off</font>

1042
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,510
data at will I mean I'm not only

1043
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,030
constrained as the down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the download</font>

1044
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:01,320
speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end so whatever the choke</font>

1045
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:05,400
point is that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limiting</font>

1046
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:06,990
factor would be so again telling the

1047
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,460
traffic traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're a</font>

1048
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,560
terminator on that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1049
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,150
build a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and if you did you</font>

1050
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:15,360
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't recognize it because</font>

1051
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,880
most net flow analysis engines out there

1052
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,770
look at v6 traffic especially stuff

1053
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,480
that's encrypted as normal v6 traffic

1054
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:26,430
and will flag it as v6 traffic but you

1055
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:29,760
have no idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's in it another one so</font>

1056
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,080
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's known and</font>

1057
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,720
it's out there so you've got that rogue

1058
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:36,120
traffic the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't know</font>

1059
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">about specifically those BOTS the the</font>

1060
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,890
CNC type stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 one</font>

1061
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:44,730
botnet specifically used v6 hiding

1062
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:46,759
itself as ipv4 so that it can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1063
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">through routers and nobody was the wiser</font>

1064
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,930
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously there was some</font>

1065
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,130
security researchers named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bella and in</font>

1066
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,460
Georgia Tech that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in</font>

1067
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:57,930
identifying that traffic and figuring

1068
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">out wait a minute this is actually using</font>

1069
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:03,060
v6 and that's not cool but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1070
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,129
able to at least figure out that it was

1071
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,380
using it and find the C&C server find

1072
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then start working on</font>

1073
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,750
figuring out what this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

1074
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:16,740
bot was targeting what was it being used

1075
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">for illegal file-sharing so if if your</font>

1078
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,340
or throttling your banquet and you want

1079
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,780
to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that they're</font>

1080
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it because you're running a</font>

00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,440
torrent or downloading torrents or

1082
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:34,919
seeding torrents and let's say it's it's

1083
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,050
absolutely legitimate you're just you're

1084
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,360
presenting or sharing out like iron geek

1085
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,910
does when he gets video shears those out

1086
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our I so's or whatever so it's</font>

1087
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:48,120
legitimate nothing illegal let's suppose

1088
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,580
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal you can use b6 and that</font>

1089
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,990
can be you

1090
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:54,210
for peer-to-peer communications and most

1091
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:56,890
folks wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it so I</font>

1092
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:59,410
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main takeaway was and the</font>

1093
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest kind of crap moment for me was</font>

1094
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,220
that you know once a time once upon a

1095
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:06,640
time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only use to be for now there's</font>

1096
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:09,490
v6 out there so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

1097
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,470
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just one protocol I think</font>

1098
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as times change we need to change</font>

1099
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:15,339
our activity so we need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

1100
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're aware that our tools work and</font>

1101
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:21,100
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they work and I think the biggest</font>

1102
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that I kind of took away from it</font>

1103
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,580
was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you can do was</font>

1104
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,730
before you can do with v6 it's just a

1105
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,549
different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing it but but for</font>

1106
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:34,210
the most part it's pretty freaking cool

1107
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:45,600
so that's it shameless plug getting

1108
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:45,600
questions I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> beau was first</font>

1109
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,690
you

1110
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:16,400
it's a day at a router perspective it's

1111
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:19,700
most definitely not<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured by</font>

1112
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,410
default which is why when we talked

1113
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,299
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why do I need a broker why do I</font>

1114
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:25,670
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tunnel that traffic through and</font>

1115
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,430
really that was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus of why i was</font>

1116
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:29,960
looking internally because I mean think

1117
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:32,149
about it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that perspective if it's</font>

1118
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,490
internet-facing and it's a v6 address

1119
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,990
and you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you've</font>

1120
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,930
made some you know somebody's made

1121
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,540
changes somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but from like a</font>

1122
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:44,330
stack robustness obviously cisco has

1123
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,100
been a player a long time juniper is

1124
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:50,360
kind of stepping up from a firewall

1125
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:52,850
perspective and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they've made it</font>

1126
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:56,080
significantly easier and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1127
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:59,089
this but to miss configure something

1128
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,319
from a v6 perspective and I think a lot

1129
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:02,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people would understand when they</font>

1130
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,790
look at a v4 and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at an a</font>

1131
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sa that's easy to understand I mean</font>

1132
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,820
he'll it's checkpoints interface they

1133
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:10,220
just stole it and threw it on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1134
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">so it's like hey I know this BAM you</font>

1135
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,120
know click click click close that ticket

1136
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:18,379
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is it's easier but</font>

1137
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:20,540
that's why I was really targeting

1138
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,400
internally because man there are so many

1139
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:25,009
targets out there that are right and

1140
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,100
switches will pass it they understand it

1141
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:30,080
natively and in so you talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1142
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,240
vlans and stuff guess what doesn't

1143
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,759
respect vlans because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't know</font>

1144
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,439
the concept of vlans<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to know what</font>

1145
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:40,810
my router is and so that's why it's kind

1146
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,000
of a pita when you're using a Mac

1147
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:45,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you have to essentially if you</font>

1148
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,450
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know you're plugged in</font>

1149
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,040
and you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use native tools on</font>

1150
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,480
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac to do an assessment I wouldn't</font>

1151
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,550
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I'm just saying if</font>

1152
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,410
that's what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do you do</font>

1153
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,650
have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a router advertisement give</font>

1154
00:50:54,410 --> 00:51:00,529
you the local link<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or you have to</font>

1155
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:02,240
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP six server give you an</font>

1156
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,920
address and say this is what we want you

1157
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use for the local link you need to</font>

1158
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,620
auto configure the rest of it because

1159
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:09,890
part of that is based upon your mac

1160
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:12,830
address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things so that being</font>

1161
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:14,750
said if you were using backtrack or a

1162
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:17,779
bunt or whatever your tool of choice was

1163
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:19,280
you know for a distro you could very

1164
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,950
easily get on as

1165
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,530
get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six net IP address and start</font>

1166
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:27,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at those and and that's really</font>

1167
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,240
what I guess I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry honest it was</font>

1168
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:31,509
embarrassing standing there having a guy

1169
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:34,009
tell you you missed half hour crap

1170
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:36,200
because you just don't I didn't think

1171
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,660
that way I just because you know you

1172
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,189
look at targets and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you've</font>

1173
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:44,589
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> me these subnets this is what I</font>

1174
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:44,590
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after so</font>

1175
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:08,190
it depends because there could be

1176
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,680
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> segmentation there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that</font>

1177
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:12,570
would be one thing and if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1178
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,359
trunking now you're talking a complete

1179
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:16,710
change because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have there</font>

1180
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,060
has to be some configuration that is

1181
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:23,610
made that would not normally be done on

1182
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,370
a v6 side that you would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a v4 to</font>

1183
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:28,170
get that configuration in place does

1184
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:30,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of make sense so think of it</font>

1185
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">as in and come on man I'm out speaking</font>

1186
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:33,720
out of school here when I say most

1187
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,950
networks are pretty damn flat so it's

1188
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,580
not like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a</font>

1189
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:45,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult time finding some targets but</font>

1190
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:45,799
yeah yeah so did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

1191
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:06,430
actually you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you don't use a</font>

1192
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:08,799
fake ipv6 address you use one that's

1193
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,060
built upon built using part of part of

1194
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirement has to have your mac</font>

1195
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:16,509
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so think about if I've been</font>

1196
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">given a v6 address or subscribe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1197
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:21,610
v6 address how would I deal with

1198
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:25,540
assigning that so for an auto

1199
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:26,920
configuration it creates an ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

1200
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">dude you're talking that whatever that</font>

1201
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,670
large ass number is the idea of you

1202
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:36,700
getting a collision between<font color="#CCCCCC"> two v6</font>

1203
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,810
addresses is pretty slim to none I mean

1204
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about it it's not going to happen</font>

1205
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:59,950
so no<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you would you would then have</font>

1206
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:01,540
a set of IP addresses that are publicly

1207
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessible that you would still be</font>

1208
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,430
assigned in and so then but the notion

1209
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,750
of using that for because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fact</font>

1210
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:09,730
that we have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT you don't</font>

1211
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:12,280
necessarily have to in a v6 environment

1212
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:15,130
does that make sense and they said you

1213
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,420
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share the university man</font>

1214
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:17,890
most people are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to use</font>

1215
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,950
some sort of matting in their

1216
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,410
environment because they don't have

1217
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:25,359
10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 20,000 or you know 70,000</font>

1218
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:28,390
depending on the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your company IP</font>

1219
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,830
address is readily<font color="#CCCCCC"> available and if they</font>

1220
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:32,200
did the Chinese<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to buy them because</font>

1221
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,310
they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 million short because</font>

1222
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:41,430
apparently they hadn't figured out what

1223
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">matting is so anybody else</font>

1224
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,830
if you want to screw someone you're

1225
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:00,610
basically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to either figure</font>

1226
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what their</font>

1227
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:07,570
yes no no so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually advertise</font>

1228
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,009
yourself as that address and if the

1229
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,420
other one was auto configured not

1230
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:15,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">statically assigned or even if it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1231
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:17,530
signed by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP v6 it will say wow</font>

1232
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:19,240
there's a there's a collision here you

1233
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,670
know we have duplicates I need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1234
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">new one and so it'll generate a new one</font>

1235
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,050
based in part of the generation for an

1236
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:28,329
auto configuration is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the mac</font>

1237
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:30,670
address for auto configuration for dhcp

1238
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:32,560
it says these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scopes that you</font>

1239
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,940
have available for you to be able to

1240
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,410
sign from same thing as before it

1241
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,790
doesn't that doesn't change so to

1242
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,140
essentially do you ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> see where you</font>

1243
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:40,869
have a duplicate IP address on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1244
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:43,078
network it's the same exact thing so you

1245
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">can take over somebody's address if it's</font>

1246
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:50,980
auto configured or it's set to dhcp if

1247
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's static you both back off and then</font>

1248
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:54,190
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a pissing contest to see</font>

1249
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:57,069
who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> win and chances are it's</font>

1250
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:59,020
going to win<font color="#CCCCCC"> because then the routers</font>

1251
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,030
are actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the age that it's</font>

1252
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:02,470
seen that particular IP address and

1253
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,730
which board it came through and start

1254
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,890
that's where some of the intelligence

1255
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:09,640
built into<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Cisco devices will start</font>

1256
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:11,078
saying yeah that's the whole mechanisms

1257
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,680
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> built in that says no that's</font>

1258
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:16,510
you're not who you say you are but but

1259
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,490
again that but but again if I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1260
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:21,220
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> over somebody's address it's only</font>

1261
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:25,290
applicable on that local that I cannot

1262
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,290
cross a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1263
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:48,110
you mean from a from a v6 perspective no

1264
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:51,470
no I mean I've done it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v4</font>

1265
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:55,340
perspective but never never had one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1266
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:57,649
required us to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no but we've</font>

1267
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">done firewall assessments of ones that</font>

1268
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:01,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">were misconfigured that actually did</font>

1269
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:04,970
have v6 enabled and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hadn't they had no</font>

1270
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea they had done it it's like whoa we</font>

1271
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:07,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have that and of course you're on</font>

1272
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,470
the conference call and they're arguing

1273
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:12,080
with you we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this enabled and</font>

1274
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,720
this like no trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not a</font>

1275
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,040
Photoshop screenshot it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1276
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,750
screenshot of your interface they go

1277
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,100
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they go can we move on to</font>

1278
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next point because they realized</font>

1279
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:25,370
that that that now they did screw up and

1280
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had a misconfigured and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1281
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:29,480
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that the company but it was</font>

1282
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,070
a Juniper device and it was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1283
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,070
easy to see how they made the mistake

1284
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:57,850
oh yeah yeah yeah oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1285
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:59,440
didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that clear the same thing</font>

1286
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you do on a v4 network from a</font>

1287
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,600
firewall perspective as Windows Linux

1288
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,330
Mac it doesn't matter you do the same

1289
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:10,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing on the v6 side you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just run a</font>

1290
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:14,500
different command to initiate the v6

1291
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:19,360
side so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipfw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1292
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:23,710
looking at IP 6fw versus the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipfw</font>

1293
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:27,670
and so that's why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pull up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

1294
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:37,480
mac version you'll see that it is set by

1295
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:43,900
default to allow any any which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no</font>

1296
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:46,720
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is ipv6 fw yeah</font>

1297
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,670
so it uses different commands to control

1298
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,009
the rule sets for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the given interface</font>

1299
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,840
the first thing you'd have to do is go

1300
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:57,880
through and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of them</font>

1301
00:58:52,840 --> 00:59:00,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">are allowed to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotcha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1302
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,080
fusion install on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac as if you</font>

1303
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">install VMware fusion it doesn't</font>

1304
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,000
natively enable on a Mac on a windows

1305
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,270
box completely different eating yes it

1306
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,840
does but it doesn't natively enable the

1307
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:16,770
v6 interface for a vm net<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 or 1 so you</font>

1308
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,770
have to go through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabling</font>

1309
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:32,140
no because I target those so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1310
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that at all I would say</font>

1311
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,520
make sure you have them enabled and the

1312
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,830
default firewall rule set is set in

1313
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,460
other words get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any any just leave it</font>

1314
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:43,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that and we'll be good to go I can</font>

1315
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,980
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business card you can call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1316
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,110
will come assess you and have a good

1317
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,510
time by the way Red is good for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> green</font>

1318
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is bad so that's kind of we in verse</font>

1319
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:56,110
that but yeah I say I say that in jest

1320
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:58,510
but I think you you are going to have to

1321
00:59:56,110 --> 01:00:02,140
reach the point where you start looking

1322
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">at getting a transition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

1323
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:06,160
now is it going to be this iteration of

1324
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,649
windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 or whatever no but when you</font>

1325
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,390
know by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> there turned on you've</font>

1326
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,220
got to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consideration and</font>

1327
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:14,850
say I've got a hole here that someone's

1328
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,850
going to look at

1329
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:34,740
and that's a fair statement and again

1330
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:35,999
remember I have a myopic view I target

1331
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,890
that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the one I would not</font>

1332
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:40,169
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turning it off but in</font>

1333
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:43,078
reality if when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we write up on us we do</font>

1334
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:45,480
recommend if you're not if you're and it

1335
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,849
goes with any service if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not need</font>

1336
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:51,960
that service disabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> that service if</font>

1337
01:00:47,849 --> 01:00:54,779
you're not using it turn it off after we

1338
01:00:51,960 --> 01:01:06,240
leave you know after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we leave your</font>

1339
01:00:54,779 --> 01:01:07,499
engagement so I'm sorry yeah and in fact

1340
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,089
one of it that's interesting you should

1341
01:01:07,499 --> 01:01:12,660
say that because one of if you look at

1342
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:16,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 80 2008 and you start looking at the</font>

1343
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:19,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">DHCP settings natively built into it is</font>

1344
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:21,029
v6 built right into it so it's and you

1345
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:23,848
can you if you've seen it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

1346
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:27,329
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is to check one box and then I'm</font>

1347
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:28,799
screwed because guess what it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1348
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:30,059
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking and saying I can allocate</font>

1349
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:33,480
those back out but it'll more

1350
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,099
importantly do a advertisement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1351
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,549
this is this is what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

1352
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:37,549
to you

1353
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:50,250
teredo<font color="#E5E5E5"> toupees how do you block Torito</font>

1354
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,430
from natively building a six tunnel and

1355
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:55,410
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to do</font>

1356
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,970
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look there's their</font>

1357
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,470
servers out the Torito servers that

1358
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:59,790
you're going to be connecting to that

1359
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:02,730
you're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunnel with are well</font>

1360
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:04,859
documented so you can go to the the

1361
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft's website and find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1362
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're clearly listed I know that are</font>

1363
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,960
certain content filtering things that go

1364
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:15,510
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deeper from a</font>

1365
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:25,140
packet inspection they will block that

1366
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:27,869
natively yeah but what it actually

1367
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:29,040
requires is it it performs an SSL main

1368
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,180
in the middle so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're</font>

1369
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bank of america you're not</font>

1370
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,720
you're actually going to the appliance

1371
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:35,880
sitting there on their local network and

1372
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,529
that kind of pisses off a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1373
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,460
when they find out that you have the

1374
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at their bank</font>

1375
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:44,640
transactions and that type of stuff but

1376
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:46,410
that is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements and so</font>

1377
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the then you get</font>

1378
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:51,299
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk evaluation is the risk</font>

1379
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,910
worth the risk of losing your job for

1380
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,829
you know implementing something without

1381
01:02:53,910 --> 01:03:01,049
making sure that you have legal buy-in

1382
01:02:55,829 --> 01:03:03,560
to do that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right man that's it</font>

1383
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:03,560
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font>

1384
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,180
the other one would
