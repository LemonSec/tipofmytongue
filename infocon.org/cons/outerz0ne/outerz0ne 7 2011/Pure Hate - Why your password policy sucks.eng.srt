1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
right so title of my presentation is

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be called your password policy</font>

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:14,400
sucks this presentation kind of came out

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,490
of last year I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did some real technical</font>

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,410
presentations on on a tool called ocl

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,589
hash cat and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people mentioned</font>

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,099
that I that I skipped a big part in the

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning and and that was kind of basic</font>

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,380
usage and and how I arrived<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the way</font>

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,030
that that we use things and so I'm going

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of maybe go backwards this year</font>

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,329
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation and and hopefully</font>

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,730
show a little bit about this stuff Who

14
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,770
am I I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security consultant at a key</font>

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">bought consultants and nice word for</font>

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,200
hacker a core developer for backtrack

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,218
linux anybody ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard of backtrack</font>

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:59,030
yes no look and just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case my</font>

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation sucks is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:16,380
backtrack 5 you saw it here first that

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:17,820
was called a teaser and anyway I'm

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">awesome a founder</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,960
question defense com we do technical

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
questions technical answers some are

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,899
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid like how to turn on my</font>

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">monitor and some of them are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,600
complex like<font color="#CCCCCC"> pentesting type stuff to me</font>

28
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,699
and my friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alex we do it for fun it's</font>

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also a co-founder at</font>

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,840
Derby con which is a convention that's

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
going to be in louisville kentucky that

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,820
me Adrian and Dave Kennedy are putting

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,570
on and that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last weekend to</font>

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,220
September first weekend of October and

35
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:51,119
most importantly for this presentation I

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,130
was the member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that won the</font>

37
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,560
password cracking contest at Def Con

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,780
this year or last year I guess trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

39
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,340
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it together anyway so this company</font>

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">called corelogic put on a contest called</font>

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,899
correct me if you can the basis of the

42
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,940
contest was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

43
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,980
people as you want it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your team and</font>

44
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,630
there were sixty thousand hashes and

45
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,170
whoever could crack the most of them in

46
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,760
48 hours and so me and my team<font color="#E5E5E5"> won that</font>

47
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,320
competition and that's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,899
reason that I was doing this talk is a

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,480
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people wanted to know exactly the</font>

50
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,270
mythology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we used in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to crack</font>

51
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:29,609
those lists of passwords work so my

52
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,250
disclaimer is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password expert</font>

53
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,160
I don't know everything frequently wrong

54
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,690
and slow to admit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not</font>

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,500
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what you do with any of</font>

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,270
this information so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that I</font>

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,190
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover our wire passwords still a</font>

58
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,110
vector<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attack one reason is people</font>

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,910
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always saying you know passwords one</font>

60
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">out four or five years ago as soon as we</font>

61
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,049
made passwords over<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight and ten</font>

62
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,180
characters tools like John the Ripper

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,330
became useless because it takes so long

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">for cpu-based password cracking and so</font>

65
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,060
we'll talk about later some of the

66
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,300
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have come back that have</font>

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,760
brought passwords back company still

68
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,190
have bad password policies I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about those I'm going</font>

70
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze a few of the recent most</font>

71
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,440
password breaches and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over a little</font>

72
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,350
bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information why those</font>

73
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,750
breaches are so valuable if you're ever

74
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,120
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter or on IRC when one of those</font>

75
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,410
breaches happens you'll notice that you

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,270
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font>

77
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,010
cracking community will be in a hurry to

78
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,560
get those lists as quick as possible

79
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:31,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">before companies like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paste</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bin take</font>

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,290
them down talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for why</font>

81
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,120
we want those and some of the

82
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,829
advancements and password recovery and

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,530
then the tools and techniques to crack

84
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:43,830
passwords obviously I'm biased a hash

85
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,239
cat but there's a lot of new tools that

86
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,750
have come out in kind of the hash<font color="#CCCCCC"> caps</font>

87
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,489
sweet and we'll talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

88
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,459
so what's wrong with passwords they are

89
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,110
the weakest method of authentication

90
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,000
password authentication is just terrible

91
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:03,420
but unfortunately we're stuck with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do to make pies</font>

93
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,820
we're going to talk a little bit about

94
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,620
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do to make that password</font>

95
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,120
authentication better<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

96
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,310
companies go have gone to two factor

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,630
authentication although if you've been

98
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,180
paying attention to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news in the last</font>

99
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:18,289
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> days your RSA</font>

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,120
might be useless many websites and this

101
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,889
is particularly true of<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites not</font>

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,880
necessarily internal networks but

103
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:27,949
websites are notoriously bad for bad

104
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,930
hashing algorithms you know five ten

105
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:31,430
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago websites were getting blasted</font>

106
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,470
all over the place for store and

107
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,289
passwords in<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text now they're</font>

108
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,100
still store and hash storm passwords

109
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:41,570
with weak hashing algorithms<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

110
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,889
thing about passwords as humans are

111
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,360
predictable and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that a</font>

112
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,710
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later but like one when</font>

113
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,810
you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your desk at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

114
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,270
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and you're making up your</font>

115
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,500
password nine times out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten you're</font>

116
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,659
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking around the room and</font>

117
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,490
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see something that has</font>

118
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,139
to do with company X and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

119
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,060
be the root of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you may</font>

120
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,380
add some upper cases and special

121
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,639
characters and that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff but</font>

122
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,190
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will make their</font>

123
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:09,740
password specific to their environment

124
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:12,979
and then with the use of GPU password

125
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,710
recovery it's become pretty much a<font color="#E5E5E5"> joke</font>

126
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:19,340
to pass to crack a lot of password

127
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,989
algorithms so you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself my</font>

128
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,340
company's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password policy we're</font>

129
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,870
good that's great however what I'm going

130
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show is that knowing the password</font>

131
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,669
policy of a company can actually help

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,169
the password cracking if I know that

133
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,780
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paula and I'm jumping the gun</font>

134
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,729
here I'll get into that in a minute and

135
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,260
some organizations impose really

136
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:40,550
limiting password policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

137
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,280
show you a real world one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

138
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,130
actually found and the worst thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

139
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,169
all is that many many many companies

140
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,240
never ever change the default Windows

141
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,609
Active Directory password policy because

142
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,750
they feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's good enough that's</font>

143
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,940
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out so here's a real</font>

144
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,229
world example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I blacked out the name of</font>

145
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the company not to embarrass them</font>

146
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">however this is a real world password</font>

147
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:07,430
policy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually found on the</font>

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,830
internet and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at it let's</font>

149
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,770
go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it your password policy is</font>

150
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,719
case sensitive that's fine it cannot

151
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,650
contain any special characters

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,389
whatsoever that's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit limiting</font>

153
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,940
it can't contain your<font color="#CCCCCC"> username well</font>

154
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,380
that's sort of a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy it can't</font>

155
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,219
can

156
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,630
pain two separated numbers I mean is

157
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,950
that not the most ridiculous thing

158
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,480
you've ever heard so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that</font>

159
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">your numbers cannot be separated</font>

160
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,290
anywhere in the password they have to be

161
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,460
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it can't contain</font>

162
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,470
company name or password yeah I'm not

163
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,120
sure this was a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm not</font>

164
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly I'm assuming this is some</font>

165
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,470
homegrown coded application this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

166
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">some policies I was honestly trying to</font>

167
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:54,010
find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst policy that I could this</font>

168
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what I came up with so this is wrong</font>

169
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,930
on a lot of levels so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

170
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,630
character maximum so that's a failure

171
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,420
all by itself anything under 10

172
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,810
characters is easily crackable no

173
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,420
special characters so the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard</font>

174
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,610
has 94 typable characters and 32 of them

175
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,040
are specials so if we eliminate those 32

176
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:19,890
characters we've eliminated one third of

177
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:22,900
the possible password characters and

178
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,340
then numbers can't be separated I still

179
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,440
can't get my head around that I'm not

180
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,950
exactly sure how that happened but

181
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,680
anyway so if you worked at my company

182
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,120
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coupon you might come up with</font>

183
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,120
some of these passwords based on this

184
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,730
password policy so in the beginning I

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,800
got this really common one which would

186
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,240
be one numbers got to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept one</font>

187
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,380
letters got to be capitalized it's

188
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,880
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the first letter cuz</font>

189
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,469
it's easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember and you might need</font>

190
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to append some digits to the end it's</font>

191
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a date like the data was</font>

192
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,700
born you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and then you go down the</font>

193
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,710
list here and so at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

194
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,260
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular password policy</font>

195
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,229
this is the best possible password that

196
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,849
I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up with and it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

197
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:08,170
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> great of a password because it's</font>

198
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:11,500
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> using 66 of the 94 character 64 of</font>

199
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,740
the 94 character sets and so and it's

200
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,580
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take character max maximum</font>

201
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,440
using some of the tools we're going to

202
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,330
look at later that password to easily be

203
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,040
broken in an hour and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font>

204
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,880
best possible password this website can

205
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:29,000
come up with you can imagine what

206
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:31,400
stover like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so when I talk</font>

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the patterns that people make</font>

208
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,880
password choices on this is really

209
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,380
really really important because when

210
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,390
you're on a pen test and I'm talking

211
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:41,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">legally here it's important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

212
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,429
profile an organization and what when I

213
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,200
mean by profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> an organization I mean</font>

214
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,479
like downloading the entire website

215
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,550
turning it into word lists downloading

216
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,380
the city that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in the sports</font>

217
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,699
teams that are around there you know

218
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,770
that kind of thing if it's a religious

219
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,470
organization we might want to you know

220
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,420
make a word list out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of there what do</font>

221
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it Bible or special book or</font>

222
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got going on and so when</font>

223
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,980
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> make passwords they'll always</font>

224
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,599
almost always look around them and and

225
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making these things up this</font>

226
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,800
is from personal experience on<font color="#E5E5E5"> pentest</font>

227
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,540
looking at the analyzing the passwords

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,069
from companies and seeing how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

229
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,640
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have company name</font>

230
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,860
somewhere in them numbers are almost

231
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,699
always going to be in a date format 11

232
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:27,140
or 2011 if the password policy requires

233
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,060
a capital letter it's almost always

234
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,620
going to be the first letter and if the

235
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,150
password policy requires a special

236
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">character it's almost always always</font>

237
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,770
going to be at the end so here's another

238
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,599
policy and this is the type of policy

239
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,840
that I see in place almost everywhere

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,030
that I go so your password must be at

241
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,860
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 characters it must contain one</font>

242
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,449
uppercase letter it must contain one

243
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,310
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it must contain one special</font>

244
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,560
character right sound familiar people

245
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,689
got policies going on like that well the

246
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">average person like I said is going to</font>

247
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,280
capitalize the first letter choose a

248
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,930
word choose a meaningful date and choose

249
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,189
a random character and most likely

250
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:12,130
they're going to come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

251
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,130
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this if they work in my company so</font>

252
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,910
you're thinking my passwords are leaked

253
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,590
and that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be true everybody in this</font>

254
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,810
room might have awesome passwords but

255
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,610
that is not true in the real world and

256
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,780
so you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

257
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:29,430
we're when we're auditing companies

258
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,560
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about average people and</font>

259
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,410
so like I said these presumptions are

260
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,359
made from my personal experience and

261
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,219
it's also been my experience that most

262
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,260
companies are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in security</font>

263
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,260
until they experience some type of hack

264
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,360
alright so this bad password policy

265
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,089
happens for a couple reasons one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

266
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">is lazy network admins which accept the</font>

267
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:57,900
default Windows Active Directory policy

268
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:01,530
it can be changed the worst offender i

269
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:03,360
think is badly coded applications what

270
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm assuming that very first policy that</font>

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,940
we looked at in the beginning that

272
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,740
didn't allow special characters what I'm

273
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,080
assuming is that whoever coded that

274
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,270
application sucked and he was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

275
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a password validation field</font>

276
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,380
that would take special characters and

277
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,990
so instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of learning how to code</font>

278
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,180
properly they just decided to fix their

279
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,740
policy and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you that that</font>

280
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">company is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that mistake</font>

281
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,720
they might have saved a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">money on the application but anyway</font>

283
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,660
another major reason CEOs complain CEOs

284
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,949
as you know run the companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if</font>

285
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,260
they complain they don't want to enter

286
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,450
in some big long crappy password they

287
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,340
complain and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're your boss the</font>

288
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,020
network admins have to fix the policy to

289
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,160
suit the CEOs and another big reason is

290
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that companies don't have regular</font>

291
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,930
password audits in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

292
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,820
with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these password policies in</font>

293
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,380
place it's always a good idea to just

294
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,090
dump your password hash list in your

295
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">company and have it audited by a third</font>

296
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,180
party company and then it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

297
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,530
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though you have a strict</font>

298
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,180
policy people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are still going to make</font>

299
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,770
those patterns based on past are those

300
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,239
passwords based on patterns so if you

301
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,220
audit passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go to those</font>

302
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,590
users one two three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> times a year</font>

303
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,720
and say hey we know your password follow

304
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,090
the policy but it sucked it was

305
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,800
predictable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually those people</font>

306
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,580
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get tired of you coming to</font>

307
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,410
them and they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose a</font>

308
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">better passer</font>

309
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:29,310
nobody likes business from the IT

310
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,330
security department<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so we're</font>

311
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about how we can leverage</font>

312
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:38,580
this info in a pen test so what I like

313
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is analyze current real-world</font>

314
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,810
lists you know those password lists that

315
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,250
are up on what's a packet storm or

316
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,680
something that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

317
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">unix-based passwords that were hacked in</font>

318
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,719
1999 or something like that those are

319
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,599
not valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore you know those are not</font>

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,810
good for much yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dictionary</font>

321
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,750
words but but most applications and

322
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,569
companies have kind of gotten over those

323
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,040
type of passwords anyway they can still

324
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,600
be useful as what i like to call root

325
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,790
passwords which I'll talk about in a

326
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:13,680
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and so analyzing the patterns</font>

327
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:16,199
from these lists from the new list is

328
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,810
what can help us to leverage against

329
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,370
against new passwords attack and and the

330
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,410
main problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

331
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:27,649
the same or similar passwords against

332
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:32,189
across all their internet accounts and

333
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:36,089
so here's the little graph of I'm trying

334
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:38,880
to show if I know what the policy is how

335
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:41,940
much quicker I can brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force the</font>

336
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,829
password so at the top I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventh</font>

337
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,420
character password and i'll know

338
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:48,359
anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i gotta</font>

339
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,790
try 94 94 94 it's actually ninety four

340
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,680
times ninety four times 94 anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

341
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:55,319
pretty sure my math is right but if it's

342
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">not don't kill me but so anyway if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

343
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,540
the brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force that's that seven</font>

344
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,300
character password at 250 million

345
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,699
passwords per second they would take me

346
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,010
72 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get through the list of all</font>

347
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,820
the possible combinations so that's kind

348
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,819
of a long time it's not

349
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:28,310
what's the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> current I mean it's</font>

350
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible you know what I mean you might</font>

351
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,680
get a fourth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way through the list</font>

352
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,360
you might get a third of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way through</font>

353
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,680
the list I mean it's kind of debatable

354
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,870
you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it all depends on</font>

355
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,310
what application you're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> to brute</font>

356
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,560
force it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it goes through the</font>

357
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,689
combinations this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this is just</font>

358
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,589
the worst case scenario type of thing so

359
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,450
yeah it might not take this long<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

360
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,200
but if I'm aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password policy</font>

361
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,970
and I know that there's got to be an

362
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,320
uppercase letter and there's got to be a

363
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,910
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> character and there's got to be</font>

364
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
some digits based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

365
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">information I found before the first</font>

366
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,939
character I only got to try twenty six

367
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:04,700
upper case the next couple characters i

368
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,800
only got to try 26<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower case the next</font>

369
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,660
two characters might only have to try

370
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 digits and the last character</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

371
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,750
might only have to try a special and so

372
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,000
that would cut in this particular

373
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,209
situation might act i'm down to six

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,500
point 21 seconds at 250 million

375
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:27,589
passwords per second and so the way

376
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:30,199
question yeah yeah go ahead well

377
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just made up the 250 million</font>

378
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,979
for the math but I can go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

379
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,470
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the hardware at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

380
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,269
I'm John the Ripper I think does about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

381
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,779
million or two million passwords per

382
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,010
second maybe and I got a graph in just a

383
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,680
little while that will show some of the

384
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">GPU based type stuff but but for the</font>

385
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,319
most part with like one average video

386
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,000
card like a new video 295 GTX you can

387
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,570
get about 300 million passwords per

388
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,930
second so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much any gamer that has</font>

389
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:02,110
a spare video card can do this which is

390
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,109
bad

391
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so here's what I consider the</font>

392
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">top breaches of the last couple of years</font>

393
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,730
and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an example of the</font>

394
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,440
week hashing password algorithms that

395
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,950
are out there everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember rock</font>

396
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,540
you rock you yes anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> their breach</font>

397
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,790
consisted of let me get this number

398
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">right 14 million something or other</font>

399
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,709
passwords and they were all hatched in

400
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,750
md5 which is a really bad algorithm

401
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,630
because it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> require a salt salt</font>

402
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:36,630
and passwords are a little bit better

403
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:38,670
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody remembers gawkers gawkers</font>

404
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:41,939
had 67 million passwords which were in

405
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,680
Des which is such an old algorithm that

406
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,140
our gpu-based crash where password

407
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,689
crackers can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even do it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

408
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,430
some hardware level type of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

409
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,930
still managed to crack that many of them

410
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:57,060
even which on the Ripper PHP BB which

411
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,319
was a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> form board anyway they had a</font>

412
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:06,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">big week 18 million md5 s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> armony just</font>

413
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:09,450
recently had a giant<font color="#E5E5E5"> breach 224 million</font>

414
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,850
md fives and then I'm not allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

415
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the name of this site but anyway so they</font>

416
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:22,829
also had a breach of 38 million md5 s no

417
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:36,120
no once again I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to say the</font>

418
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:37,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the site no anyway so the reason</font>

419
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have these lists is because</font>

420
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,830
these are absolute goldmine of

421
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,959
information because these are real live

422
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,330
passwords that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using and I</font>

423
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,270
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you that you know some</font>

424
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,520
lady on eHarmony that's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font>

425
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,470
date use the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same password for her</font>

426
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,850
bank account and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it um</font>

427
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:58,320
so but the reason that that that might

428
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,939
be a nefarious reason for one these

429
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,470
lists the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want these list</font>

430
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,690
is for patterns you know I'm looking for

431
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,120
stuff like our<font color="#E5E5E5"> people separating words</font>

432
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,410
with special characters you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

433
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,830
example like is that a new pattern

434
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,830
that's a

435
00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:15,019
so the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can learn are the</font>

436
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,658
most common password links which are

437
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:20,179
important the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common character sets</font>

438
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:21,859
the most common masks and I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

439
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:24,499
what a mask is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one second and</font>

440
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:26,178
the frequency<font color="#E5E5E5"> of root passwords what i</font>

441
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:28,190
mean by the root password is if you take

442
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,590
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the upper case and the lead and</font>

443
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,629
all that garbage you're left with what's

444
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,859
called a root password and so that's

445
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:35,809
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that we're concerned about</font>

446
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">because as will look at later we can</font>

447
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,009
apply all these rules to a root password

448
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,499
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of having a word list</font>

449
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:43,999
that's babka trillion gigabytes we can

450
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:46,279
just have a little bitty word list and a

451
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:48,830
lot of effective rules and so that's the

452
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:53,029
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's the way that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we attack</font>

453
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:55,549
password attack passwords nowadays<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

454
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so when I'm talking about password</font>

455
00:18:55,549 --> 00:19:00,440
masks what I'm talking about is

456
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,940
replacing all the lowercase letters with

457
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,729
? L upper case ? EU numbers ?<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

458
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,549
special characters ? ass there's also a

459
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:12,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">question mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> h4 hex characters but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

460
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,908
don't have never used it and and I don't

461
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:17,119
want to put it up there and confuse

462
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:18,440
anybody so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to my password</font>

463
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had before because i work at</font>

464
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">activant and I was you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's year</font>

465
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:25,539
2011 and I thought this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good</font>

466
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:27,919
password so my mask would look like this

467
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:34,190
so that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a lot of sense</font>

468
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:36,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now but it will in a second so if</font>

469
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do some analysis I'm not going to do</font>

470
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:39,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the whisks i'm going to do rock you</font>

471
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,070
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i combined all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

472
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,749
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we analyze the rock you list we</font>

473
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,029
can see the first thing we want to look

474
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:48,830
at is them is the line count statistics

475
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,389
and this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many characters the</font>

476
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,889
passwords were doesn't matter if they're

477
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,478
upper low or special or anything like

478
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:55,639
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how many</font>

479
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:57,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">characters so we can see that twenty</font>

480
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:00,978
percent of them are eight character

481
00:19:57,859 --> 00:20:02,809
passwords so when I complete my first

482
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:04,549
attack against<font color="#CCCCCC"> a current password list</font>

483
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,259
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use eight characters as the</font>

484
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,389
first you know that's going to be my

485
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:10,429
first base line because twenty percent

486
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:12,228
of 14 million bna characters is a lot

487
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,419
and then you can see the next one down

488
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:18,229
is seven the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one down is nine ten</font>

489
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:19,630
and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so based on number of</font>

490
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:21,190
characters this is the

491
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mac Monmouth ology is going to go into</font>

492
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,510
and there's no one specific special

493
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,070
attack against a password list you

494
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,840
normally have to do multiple multiple

495
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,490
things which will kind of look at later

496
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:35,020
to kind of whittle your list down one at

497
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:37,060
a time so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we want to look</font>

498
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,520
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> statistics of the rock you</font>

499
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,639
list is we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the character</font>

500
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,700
set statistics and so we can see that

501
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,920
forty-two percent of the passwords are

502
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,830
lower alphanumeric meaning all they used

503
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,460
was lower case characters and numbers so

504
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:56,560
that is close to half so now armed with

505
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,320
these facts now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that if I do an</font>

506
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,710
eight character attack with numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

507
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:08,590
letters lowercase I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get all</font>

508
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:10,750
this fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the passwords so</font>

509
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,090
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> statistic we want to look at is</font>

510
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,310
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular tool what it does is it</font>

511
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,189
outputs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> masks remember the masked we</font>

512
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:21,070
were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so it outputs the</font>

513
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:22,930
masks in lower up or digits and so

514
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,600
something interesting that you can see

515
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,150
in these top 10 or 15 or however many

516
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,209
masks there are is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are no use</font>

517
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,800
there's no upper case at all and so what

518
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,600
that tells me is that people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

519
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,120
using a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of uppercase letters in</font>

520
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,350
real-world passwords and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

521
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most popular mask was eight</font>

522
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,530
lowercase digits which we already

523
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,350
determined from some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other stuff</font>

524
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">but so this type of thing is useful</font>

525
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,389
because once you start adding up with

526
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,980
adding up lists and lists and lists you

527
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,110
can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing what the most common</font>

528
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:02,320
masks are and so keep in mind this is

529
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:05,080
only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> list alright so what I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

530
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,580
was I analyzed I put all those password

531
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,840
lists of those top<font color="#E5E5E5"> five breaches</font>

532
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,080
together and I did a little bit of

533
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,610
analysis and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is</font>

534
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,610
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the exact same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

535
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,889
already knew is that eight characters is

536
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,370
the most popular line count and alpha

537
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:26,310
lower alpha numeric is the is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

538
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:30,629
popular character set of passwords

539
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:32,639
so and then what i can do is i can get

540
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,130
my top five masks out of here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

541
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,930
masks like this work in OC l hash cat

542
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,150
and hash cat is which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use these</font>

543
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:43,050
masks and why we made this tool to do

544
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:44,670
this so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

545
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,620
attacks that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try against</font>

546
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,000
any password list before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

547
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get out a word list</font>

548
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,560
because i don't need one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

549
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:57,540
that these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patterns that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> humans</font>

550
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:00,600
are you doing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now alright so how</font>

551
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,639
does all this info help us it eliminates

552
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,230
the needs for a large word lists because

553
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,820
these masks attacks do not require a

554
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,500
word list it's basically a brute force

555
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a brute force of the</font>

556
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,460
character set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you place in there so</font>

557
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,640
if you put an El it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only doing a brute</font>

558
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,540
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> of A to Z lower like I said these</font>

559
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,370
masks can be used with ocl hash cat

560
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,510
these masks allow us to profile password

561
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:26,040
policies and so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we analyze a</font>

562
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,980
new breach we get more info for our

563
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,780
attacks the way that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can profile</font>

564
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,130
a password policy is I might go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

565
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,470
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm like dump the hash</font>

566
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,480
database and I might only crack five

567
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,850
percent of the passwords with my initial

568
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,830
brief force however what I can do is

569
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,230
then analyzed that small list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

570
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,179
passwords and while looking at it I can

571
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,190
nine times out of ten determine the

572
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,320
password policy of that organization and

573
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,340
then I can retailer my attack just to

574
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,340
that password policy

575
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,620
yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically i would just redo the</font>

576
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,510
masks to match the policy and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

577
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,370
said there's no one all super inclusive

578
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,140
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wish there was but sometimes</font>

579
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got to try eight or ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve</font>

580
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,440
different masks but they won't you know

581
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,270
you keep whittling away at the list

582
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,270
eventually you'll get enough of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

583
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,920
i'm actually at i had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video that was</font>

584
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,540
awesome but we can't see it but i'm

585
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try to explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack but</font>

586
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,980
anyway so here's kind of my mythology

587
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,020
and this is the mythology that we used

588
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,480
in the contest this is what a lot of

589
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,990
people were interested in the first

590
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,670
thing we did was we brute forced all the

591
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,010
lists for up to five six characters

592
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:36,410
based on our GPU hardware that really

593
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,410
only took about 10 or 15 minutes and so

594
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gave us our initial list where we</font>

595
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:43,640
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where we started to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

596
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,230
the patterns the thing about this

597
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,240
contest what that was a little bit

598
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,830
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is</font>

599
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,600
that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really real world those</font>

600
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,730
guys at corelogic<font color="#CCCCCC"> or password cracking</font>

601
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,840
champions and they made this contest as

602
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:58,250
hard as they possibly could and so some

603
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,110
of these real-world patterns that i'm

604
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,120
talking about weren't in there however

605
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,620
once we started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at their whist</font>

606
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,739
there were some patterns that they

607
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,389
inadvertently did and so because what

608
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,370
they initially did was they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> john</font>

609
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,840
rules to create their list they had a

610
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,629
base list of words and then they use

611
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,980
rules from<font color="#CCCCCC"> John and created the list so</font>

612
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,170
once we figured out what some of those

613
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,060
rules were we got a little bit farther

614
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,850
I'm the next thing I would do is

615
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,679
wordless attacks I would do straight

616
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,389
word lists I do not keep thousands and

617
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,940
thousands of gigs a wordless I think I

618
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:33,110
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have five gigs max of wordless and</font>

619
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:35,330
and that they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are useful but</font>

620
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:37,550
they're more useful with rules which is

621
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,320
what I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you later then I would</font>

622
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,050
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into all my mask attacks that I came</font>

623
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with with all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my you know profiling</font>

624
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,430
policies then I would do what's called a

625
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,629
combination attack which is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

626
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:52,040
look at an example of that in a minute

627
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:54,410
the next thing that I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is the</font>

628
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,810
new version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hash cat has the ability</font>

629
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,950
to create rule files similar to John the

630
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,320
Ripper but they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

631
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,180
sophisticated so i would i would build a

632
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,429
policy inside one of those rural files

633
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,280
and then the very last thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would do</font>

634
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we talked</font>

635
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,399
about called a fingerprint attack and

636
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,380
that's what the video I was going to

637
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,180
show was but you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it up here</font>

638
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">but but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain it</font>

639
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though it's tough I was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

640
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:21,650
it live but I seem to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some</font>

641
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,650
internet issues that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon's fault</font>

642
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:32,370
yeah i'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to hook up to the</font>

643
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:34,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">hotel Wi-Fi yeah so so i threw this in</font>

644
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,830
there because this is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graph of</font>

645
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:41,159
how we how we progress through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

646
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,810
contest if you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just to</font>

647
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,690
reiterate how hard the contest was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

648
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,610
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten people experienced</font>

649
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,980
super password crackers on my team and

650
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,870
we only got about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 38,000 of the 60,000</font>

651
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,940
passwords or maybe there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 58 thousand</font>

652
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,219
don't remember but you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that</font>

653
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,200
you can see how we climbed really

654
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,600
quickly in the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

655
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,520
brute force some passwords then when we

656
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,770
started to use all our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mask attacks and</font>

657
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,510
our word lists and everything we we made

658
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,580
a little steady climb but then you can

659
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,730
see right around 30,000 we kind of hit a

660
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,470
plateau and that was the point where we

661
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,450
had to go in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> start analyzing the</font>

662
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,640
list and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the patterns about</font>

663
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,350
you know doing it a little bit doing a

664
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more sophisticated than just</font>

665
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:26,370
running tools at a password list because

666
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,560
we had a what the inside pro guys who

667
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:33,090
are who are Russian professional they

668
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,560
make a commercial software tool and it's

669
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,060
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding they have racks and</font>

670
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,500
racks and racks of servers password

671
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,510
cracking they were actually hot on our

672
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,020
tail they were right<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind us the</font>

673
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,520
entire contest and so it was at this

674
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">point that we had to really kind of get</font>

675
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,980
down and and figure out some some

676
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,990
password patterns which we did and so

677
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,390
what that what that shows though is that

678
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,790
password cracking is more of an art you

679
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's not just slamming tools into</font>

680
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,450
the end of the list and getting as much

681
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,740
as you can even though that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a lot</font>

682
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,810
of people do if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

683
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,100
recover a lot of passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font>

684
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,100
kind of dive into the patterns

685
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:15,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so using the GPU to crack</font>

686
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,690
passwords this is huge this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

687
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:22,879
brought password cracking back in my

688
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:25,809
opinion at this point passwords under

689
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,980
eight characters are pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a joke</font>

690
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:30,530
excuse me with the hardware we have now

691
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,280
we can brief or say characters in less

692
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:36,170
than a few hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ridiculous and the</font>

693
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,090
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is most modern</font>

694
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:40,640
desktops have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 to 12 cores</font>

695
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,799
depending on up here how much money you

696
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,510
have or a game or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever whatever</font>

697
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,799
whatever you're doing and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

698
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,169
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about each of those cores as a</font>

699
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,330
thread in the real simplistic terms you

700
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,750
know so we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

701
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:55,428
parallel threads password cracking well

702
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,760
what they found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about GPUs is that</font>

703
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:01,160
they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and 62 240 course</font>

704
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,200
and some of the newer GPUs even have

705
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,270
more than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what they found</font>

706
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,460
out is that they could thread those GPU

707
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:09,710
applications to do parallel tasks just

708
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,260
like they could with the processors and

709
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:14,150
so that multiplied that the number of

710
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:20,379
passwords exponentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be</font>

711
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:24,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be correct so what's the best</font>

712
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,669
technology to use new<font color="#E5E5E5"> vidya has support</font>

713
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,000
through their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kudo architecture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

714
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:30,799
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay at all political debates</font>

715
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,169
about what's better<font color="#CCCCCC"> ati support is</font>

716
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,940
through stream both of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

717
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:36,320
proprietary formats so the open source

718
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,390
community they got together and they

719
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,159
developed a technology called<font color="#CCCCCC"> opencl</font>

720
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:43,400
which is an open source and supports

721
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,960
both architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

722
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:49,520
picture

723
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,799
so I what's better i don't know i use in

724
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,289
a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> because and the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

725
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:57,080
that is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the CUDA architecture</font>

726
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:58,789
has a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> development ati cards</font>

727
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,129
are actually faster however the

728
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:03,710
catalysts are the stream development is

729
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,049
not quite on par with new<font color="#CCCCCC"> vidya as far</font>

730
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,000
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm concerned so I like to sacrifice</font>

731
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:12,370
a little bit of speed for stability but

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,850
your mileage might vary on that one so

733
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:18,049
you all were asking about the statistics

734
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,719
can't see those on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my computer but</font>

735
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:24,110
anyway so here's a here's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

736
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:28,880
graphs that show<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the top one is a</font>

737
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:35,649
tuna<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vidya for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dgt X's and you can see</font>

738
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:40,390
on ntlm it does for it does four billion

739
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:42,889
30 Keys per second so that's a lot

740
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,299
that's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one hash when you add a</font>

741
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,010
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of hashes like two million</font>

742
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:54,668
hashes it does drop down to 2.5 billion

743
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:54,669
which is still quite a few sorry

744
00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:00,730
yeah that's pot that's per second anyway

745
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,700
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's per second and so the</font>

746
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:07,690
numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore md5 sha-1 my</font>

747
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:11,260
sequel anyway and then so under that I

748
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,570
have a graph of an ati card I don't know

749
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:19,000
in an ati card<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam so</font>

750
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:21,939
so this is on a HD 5970 you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

751
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,520
one hash on ntlm is quite a bit faster

752
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,650
on a single hash but if you look over at

753
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:32,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two million hashes it's</font>

754
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:33,580
significantly less so based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

755
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,720
these numbers you might want to decide

756
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,220
are you're going to be doing one two

757
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,600
three four and five hashes are you going

758
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing lists of hundreds of</font>

759
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,230
thousands of hashes from a company so

760
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:50,560
like I said your mileage<font color="#CCCCCC"> may vary on</font>

761
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:51,910
cards I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> numidia um wordless people</font>

762
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,590
are always asking me where do I store

763
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:56,560
all my millions of terabytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wordless</font>

764
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,240
I don't have them you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

765
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,889
i have like five gigabytes of wordless

766
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,680
because it's all i need there so there's

767
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,940
only so many words out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

768
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,660
everything else is rule-based

769
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,580
combinations so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big</font>

770
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,820
terabyte raid array with all this stuff

771
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it's a waste of space using</font>

772
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,929
those masks that i showed you earlier is

773
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:21,070
much much more effective and using these

774
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,570
root root words with rules so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

775
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,580
the word password and I have a rule that

776
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,470
upper cases every letter I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a rule</font>

777
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,120
that appends digits from the end I have

778
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,010
a rule that leads every word you know

779
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all these rules which is much much</font>

780
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,660
faster than going through a giant list

781
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,820
of words also a large word list is

782
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,990
impossible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage and maintain I</font>

783
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,639
don't know if anyone's ever tried to

784
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,890
open up more than a two gig word list

785
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:47,230
and nano or something but it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

786
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:49,120
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation of promise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so this</font>

787
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,140
is the stuff i skipped when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

788
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about my sophisticated</font>

789
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,870
fingerprint attack last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> i missed</font>

790
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,199
this stuff on how ocl hash code actually

791
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,719
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

792
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,580
I thought I'd go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and and kind of</font>

793
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,230
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it just a little bit this is</font>

794
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:10,340
so initially I'll just go through the

795
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">command a little bit the M is the M is</font>

796
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,049
just a switch for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm that</font>

797
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,939
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use 0 as md5 so and</font>

798
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:17,840
there's some other flags and stuff and

799
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,159
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go all through all</font>

800
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
those because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that I</font>

801
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,210
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the to the basic</font>

802
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,500
part because a lot of people don't

803
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,720
understand it's kind of hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

804
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,120
head around so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want is</font>

805
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,070
our list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hashes and then the next two</font>

806
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,500
things is hashed out works on what's

807
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,720
called a left and a right mask and so it

808
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,279
has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do both so there's what's it's</font>

809
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,539
going to do on the left side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word</font>

810
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,840
of what's it going to do on the right

811
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:44,090
side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word and so what I have here</font>

812
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,350
is implemented when I was talking

813
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,639
earlier about the combination attack so

814
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:52,070
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do is we</font>

815
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:54,799
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of our crack dictionaries</font>

816
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,899
that we you know got from Gawker or

817
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,120
whatever and we can put one dictionary

818
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:01,370
on the left side and we can put one

819
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,750
dictionary on the right side and so what

820
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,610
that will do is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see in the</font>

821
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,649
little graph where I got dictionary one

822
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,328
and dictionary<font color="#CCCCCC"> too then over on the</font>

823
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:10,578
right I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I tried to implement</font>

824
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,050
all those words will be put together one

825
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,369
in the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the end one</font>

826
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,190
at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the beginning and</font>

827
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:18,619
they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> combinative through there so</font>

828
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:21,619
basically what I've done is I've taken a

829
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:23,359
word list out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of six words and I'll turn</font>

830
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:24,859
that into an infinite number of

831
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:27,109
combinations that it could possibly be

832
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:29,899
and I haven't used a terabyte of space

833
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:32,569
on my hard drive or whatever and I got a

834
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:34,399
few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples to try to try to make</font>

835
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:38,060
that left and right mask make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

836
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:42,348
more sense so here's a couple more

837
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:44,328
examples so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first example you can</font>

838
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,119
see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end i have my left mask and</font>

839
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:50,149
my right mask and so remember my masks

840
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,250
dewas digit right so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point what</font>

841
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm doing is I'm saying take my</font>

842
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:58,369
dictionary which is dictionary one and i

843
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:59,079
want you to a pen two digits to the end

844
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:02,109
of every sing

845
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:04,979
or and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically a rule that</font>

846
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:08,200
I'm given ocl hashcode and so I've

847
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:10,029
exponentially increased my word<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and</font>

848
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,078
I've still only got six words in

849
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:16,359
dictionary one or whatever and then this

850
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,009
can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any way and so in the</font>

851
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,700
next example what I'm doing is I'm

852
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:23,859
prepending for<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowercase words or</font>

853
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,299
letters<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a price</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

854
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:30,549
so it's so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try a through z</font>

855
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:33,369
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single possibility a</font>

856
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:35,410
through z for four spaces and it's going

857
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:38,619
to prepend it to every word in my

858
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,729
dictionary so that can be effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

859
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,869
and these are the kind of things that

860
00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:42,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just got to play around with and</font>

861
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:45,999
figure out which ones are the best for

862
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,369
you so the other nice function is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

863
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:50,078
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to use numbers and digits</font>

864
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:51,609
because member alphanumeric was the most

865
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,769
popular password so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

866
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:56,799
numbers and digits you can throw it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

867
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:59,799
variable so if you can look down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

868
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:01,869
got a one and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given it lower upper</font>

869
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:04,119
special<font color="#CCCCCC"> n</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> digits so that's all 94</font>

870
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,789
typable characters and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do is</font>

871
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just use that one as my mask down</font>

872
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:11,049
there so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point I'm saying take</font>

873
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,469
my dictionary word and try to prepend

874
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">two places of all 94 typable characters</font>

875
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:20,319
to the end of the word so that's kind of

876
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:22,869
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hope that makes</font>

877
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,479
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anybody and you can play around</font>

878
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:28,029
with you can play around with the place

879
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:30,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">settings you don't have you can do more</font>

880
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:32,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">than one variable you can do a2 and a3</font>

881
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,249
and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it different variables if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

882
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:40,089
wanted to do something different on the

883
00:36:33,249 --> 00:36:44,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">left mask and the right mask so so</font>

884
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:46,029
there's also rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just made two</font>

885
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,219
charts of the rules I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

886
00:36:46,029 --> 00:36:50,289
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but i'll</font>

887
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:52,359
show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass the rule so on that</font>

888
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:54,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">same command line we could pass it some</font>

889
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,989
rules even<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the same time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the left</font>

890
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,599
and the right mask so we could pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

891
00:36:55,989 --> 00:37:00,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rule the lowercase to uppercase to</font>

892
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,789
capitalize these aren't groundbreaking

893
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:05,069
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> John has always had rules</font>

894
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:08,279
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some new ones in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here that</font>

895
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:11,729
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't exactly that are a</font>

896
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:13,859
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different than John but so</font>

897
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:16,910
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones I like to use is like</font>

898
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:19,499
trunk a web and truncate right and

899
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,319
append characters and prepend characters

900
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:25,259
like for example if it's 2011 if that's

901
00:37:22,319 --> 00:37:27,359
the year I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to prepend 2011 to</font>

902
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:33,299
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single word in my dictionary you</font>

903
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in case it might work so these</font>

904
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:38,069
rules you can play around with you can

905
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:40,589
pass more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one rule to the to the to</font>

906
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:42,449
the command it takes the first rule

907
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:44,788
first and then it does the second rule

908
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:47,130
so there's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can play around</font>

909
00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:50,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that you pass rules</font>

910
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,410
is exactly the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the left and the</font>

911
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:53,939
right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to pass a rule to the</font>

912
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,098
right side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to pass a rule</font>

913
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:59,669
to the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do one or the</font>

914
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,699
other or both so Jay passes a rule to

915
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:05,339
whatever is happening on the left side

916
00:38:01,699 --> 00:38:08,579
so in this first example what's going on

917
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,319
is i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using my dictionary and at the</font>

918
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the dictionary I'm appending to</font>

919
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:14,069
uppercase characters to the end of each

920
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:15,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">word and at the same time I'm going to</font>

921
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:17,819
uppercase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first character in my</font>

922
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,709
dictionary so that will give me

923
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:22,709
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> uppercase you know five</font>

924
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:24,989
lowers and then two more upper cases and

925
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:29,519
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pass a rule to the</font>

926
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:31,589
right side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give it the case which so</font>

927
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,799
like in this example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here C is</font>

928
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:36,509
capitalized so what I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

929
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:38,429
take my two dictionaries and put them on

930
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:41,849
both sides and capitalize the first word

931
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:43,079
in each dictionary on both sides that

932
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:44,579
actually probably wouldn't be all that

933
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,109
effective now that i think about it

934
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:48,599
because it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a capital letter in</font>

935
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:50,909
the middle of the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> however a lot of</font>

936
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,949
times people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lately people</font>

937
00:38:50,909 --> 00:38:54,449
are separating words with a special

938
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:56,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">character like because everybody's</font>

939
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:58,380
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use pass phrases</font>

940
00:38:56,009 --> 00:39:00,089
and not passwords and so a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

941
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,769
people will think of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-word phrase</font>

942
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:03,390
or a three-word phrase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

943
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:05,488
special characters on the inside of

944
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">those phrases so putting a special</font>

945
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">character in the middle of two</font>

946
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,400
dictionaries come culminating on top of

947
00:39:09,659 --> 00:39:14,039
each other can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be effective</font>

948
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,529
and I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be effective uh then</font>

949
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:20,549
like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bracket cuts off the</font>

950
00:39:16,529 --> 00:39:23,279
last cuts off the last character<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

951
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:26,670
cuts off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> character of the of</font>

952
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:27,990
the word and so something that's the

953
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:30,359
reason that i show that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

954
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:33,089
funny is in the beginning there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no</font>

955
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,619
way with this ocl<font color="#CCCCCC"> hashmap version there</font>

956
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,720
was no way just to run a straight

957
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:39,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">wordlist attack so what you had to do</font>

958
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,029
was what you had to do was you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

959
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,309
this hack here at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what you</font>

960
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:46,470
had to do was you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it you had</font>

961
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the K flag to remove the last</font>

962
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,129
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every word then you had to</font>

963
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,078
give it your word list and then you had

964
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give it a character at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end in</font>

965
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,400
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remove it and then it would</font>

966
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,079
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the word list itself so that</font>

967
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,960
was kind of a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the beginning</font>

968
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:06,270
that nobody thought of so that was a

969
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:08,520
major complaint with ocl<font color="#CCCCCC"> hashtag and</font>

970
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,359
then the other major complaint was that

971
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,920
there was no crypt md5 support and the

972
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:16,740
other major complaint was that there was

973
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,450
no support for rule files every rule had

974
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:22,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command blonde one at</font>

975
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:24,720
a time so instead of recoding the entire

976
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:28,230
application what happened was<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh CL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

977
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,509
cap<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus was born it actually did away</font>

978
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,299
with the left and the right side

979
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,609
mechanism and so what it did was it can

980
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:39,930
use word lists or it can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an</font>

981
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:41,970
entire directory of word lists and it

982
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,259
uses rule files similar to John the

983
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,410
Ripper but there's a lot more rules

984
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:52,230
available and it also supports md5 crypt

985
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:54,990
and so an example of an example of that

986
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:57,720
being run would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here would be</font>

987
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:00,180
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> M flag which is md5 are hashes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> texts</font>

988
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,200
end is actually kind of a nice level

989
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,058
there's between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 60 so it kind of</font>

990
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,129
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your GPU and the shaders and</font>

991
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,990
the clocks which nights nice level works

992
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,720
the best for you for me it's 80

993
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:16,879
generally it's 84<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna Vidya and 164 a</font>

994
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,379
TI and then so now we have rule files

995
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,849
there in the rules directory it ships

996
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,140
with a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> rules but</font>

997
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:24,180
you can get in there and make up your

998
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,749
own rules based on any of these lists

999
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,210
and then you can out doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> o is just</font>

1000
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:31,828
output to a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then and then you</font>

1001
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,599
pass it a word list at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

1002
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:35,700
you would John the Ripper or you can

1003
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,529
give a slash and a star and it will run

1004
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:44,879
all the word lists<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that director you</font>

1005
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:47,220
want after the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1006
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,479
some solutions we can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some</font>

1007
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,950
of these password policy policy things

1008
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:54,749
this talk was originally designed for

1009
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,779
something at my work so I got to come up

1010
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:59,930
with some solutions so better

1011
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:02,309
application coding practices obviously

1012
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,069
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said one of the worst</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things is</font>

1013
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:07,319
lazy coders that don't validate you know

1014
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,450
certain characters in their in their web

1015
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:11,099
applications and that type of thing I

1016
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,348
encourage all companies to have regular

1017
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,779
password audits by a third third party

1018
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:17,809
company definitely definitely more

1019
00:42:15,779 --> 00:42:20,039
sophisticated password policies

1020
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:23,160
increased minimum password lengths

1021
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,380
there's no substitute for a long as

1022
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,319
password I mean there just isn't you

1023
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,319
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the longer the better unfortunately</font>

1024
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:36,239
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to complain when you</font>

1025
00:42:34,229 --> 00:42:37,919
see bad policies every time I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1026
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,630
pen test and I see a you know a default

1027
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,910
Active Directory policy I always try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1028
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:45,269
mention it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't always come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

1029
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the best the best response but but</font>

1030
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:51,118
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to mention it I feel it's</font>

1031
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:53,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">my duty so this stuff is dope where can</font>

1032
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,130
I learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> more there's my website question</font>

1033
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:58,410
defense my friend dead ones website

1034
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,690
right here Oh B dash security info they

1035
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:03,058
have a ton of he has a ton of hash cat

1036
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:04,829
tutorials and a bunch of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

1037
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:10,440
rules and how to use them and then

1038
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:13,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously the hashtag website you're an</font>

1039
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,519
idiot we cannot complain about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if</font>

1040
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:16,349
you have any questions at all about any

1041
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,359
of this stuff you can email me or you

1042
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:23,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter or you can</font>

1043
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:26,280
I don't know talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me later thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1044
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a question I'm sorry</font>

1045
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:37,750
number one I would create I would

1046
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:39,340
enforce passphrases the way that I would

1047
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,290
enforce that is i<font color="#CCCCCC"> would say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1048
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,090
has to be a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> character or some</font>

1049
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:46,540
type of thing separate you know in the

1050
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:48,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the word I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would not allow the</font>

1051
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,770
first letter<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be capitals I would not</font>

1052
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,900
allow numbers to be at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end you know</font>

1053
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reverse you know that</font>

1054
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,620
policy we look at in the beginning said

1055
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,779
that no numbers could be separated from

1056
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,940
each other I would reverse that I would

1057
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,740
say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you must have at least</font>

1058
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,750
two numbers and they cannot be next to

1059
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,939
each other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all about and</font>

1060
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:10,120
then like I said it's about length oh

1061
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:15,250
you know over 10 characters making sure

1062
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:17,380
you use everything available yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

1063
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,360
alternating case is good it it's all

1064
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,620
about think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the way that I like to</font>

1065
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,630
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is think about what i</font>

1066
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,279
would do as a password and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just as</font>

1067
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">guilty as anyone else if it says use one</font>

1068
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,790
uppercase letter I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it the first</font>

1069
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,279
letter because it's easier you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

1070
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,200
i mean so if i say you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to</font>

1071
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,550
uppercase characters and it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1072
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,580
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter that's going to force</font>

1073
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:39,460
somebody to put them inside the word

1074
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:42,190
somewhere which which all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1075
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:46,110
bitty things added together increases

1076
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:46,110
the password strength exponentially

1077
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,590
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean random generated stuff</font>

1078
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:59,080
is always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than then a</font>

1079
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,430
password however getting your users you

1080
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,190
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember that</font>

1081
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,899
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is you know it's bad</font>

1082
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,180
policy to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your passwords in the same</font>

1083
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,130
place all over the place so so while<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1084
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">can probably remember one two three</font>

1085
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,210
maybe randomly generated passwords i

1086
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,420
can't remember as many as I need for the

1087
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet totally so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately random</font>

1088
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,510
passwords are always better but it's a

1089
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,040
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit unfeasible especially when</font>

1090
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,490
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know your user</font>

1091
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,150
base it

1092
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:30,009
sure shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 123456 shit</font>

1093
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,230
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of care about signs are</font>

1094
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,180
complicated I really care about 45

1095
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,200
absolutely and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same</font>

1096
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,000
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do have some high-level</font>

1097
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,520
passwords some medium and some low-level

1098
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,350
the problem is getting you know us being

1099
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,850
involved in technology hacking and

1100
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,009
security that makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of sense but</font>

1101
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,140
that does not make sense to my mom you

1102
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:49,180
know she could give up she could care

1103
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">less about any of that kind of stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1104
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:51,910
she uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> the password you know same</font>

1105
00:45:50,470 --> 00:46:00,970
password all over the place you did

1106
00:45:51,910 --> 00:46:07,230
despite what I say because it's easy to

1107
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:07,230
remember yeah

1108
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,860
so so best-case scenario this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my big</font>

1109
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,630
idea and so the problem is is that I'll

1110
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,240
break into things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't create sort of</font>

1111
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:35,670
policies so if i was going to create a

1112
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,740
policy for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i was creating a</font>

1113
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,390
web application I would go to one of

1114
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:41,100
those websites that has like the top 500

1115
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:42,720
worst passwords in the world or

1116
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,759
something like that and I would take

1117
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,500
that and then I would take the year and

1118
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,880
I would take some really you know some

1119
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">other random stuff because it doesn't</font>

1120
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,060
take that long to go through a couple

1121
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:53,040
thousand words real quick and then when

1122
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,540
users are input validating that once

1123
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,950
again I'm not a web app coder either so

1124
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,750
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how feasible this is but I</font>

1125
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:59,730
do think it would be possible to compare

1126
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,430
your password very quickly against a

1127
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,080
list of just really stupid shit and then

1128
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,640
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and if it</font>

1129
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">passed the list then it's okay</font>

1130
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:36,690
I start I start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brute force</font>

1131
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a brute force</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on our GPU</font>

1132
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:40,320
machines takes like five minutes so I

1133
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,170
get everything I can between<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and</font>

1134
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,120
five characters and so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1135
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,910
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you was this</font>

1136
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,560
fingerprint attacker if you ask me later

1137
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,390
have a video<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it online but it</font>

1138
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,910
basically does a brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force of the list</font>

1139
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:55,740
and expands<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then puts the two</font>

1140
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,240
sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expanded list together and</font>

1141
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,419
keeps cracking over and over again you

1142
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:02,490
never need a word list ever so so I do

1143
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,990
all those types of things but I always

1144
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">start out with a five to six character</font>

1145
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:13,549
brute force to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the low-hanging fruit</font>

1146
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:13,550
kind of thing Wow

1147
00:48:17,339 --> 00:49:02,099
yes can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me an example of an are</font>

1148
00:48:31,929 --> 00:49:02,099
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about an application right</font>

1149
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:21,759
I mean nine times I mean nine times<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1150
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,560
of ten the easiest way is to is to

1151
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,420
manage all your devices with active

1152
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,279
directory and they make it that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1153
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,200
a reason you know for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1154
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,720
on a wireless assessment where they were

1155
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing I had a radius implementation</font>

1156
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:36,160
which is supposed to be secure but it's

1157
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:39,070
not and so the radius implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1158
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,990
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> MSF chat version 2 so as soon as I</font>

1159
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,280
crack the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radius not only was on the</font>

1160
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,229
wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> network i already had</font>

1161
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,910
credentials on the network you know

1162
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:49,060
because they were using ad credentials

1163
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:52,810
so so generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see ad is being used</font>

1164
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:54,190
across the board so and and the bad part

1165
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,070
about that is is that some appliances

1166
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:00,550
store those ad passwords in less complex

1167
00:49:57,070 --> 00:50:04,180
formats like md5 than ntlm so sometimes

1168
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:05,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can attack that way Cisco for</font>

1169
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,839
example if you were using if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

1170
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,430
managing some Cisco devices you know

1171
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">their hashing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm is weaker than</font>

1172
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:17,520
ad and can be pulled down from the

1173
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">conveyor some some I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it before</font>

1174
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,640
yeah in the config

1175
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:27,578
ok

1176
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,060
you
