166
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:09,830

everything

170
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,300

171
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,219
trouble is to find a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy</font>

172
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,130

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every web page thumbnail sized</font>

174
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,990

183
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,550
put the video system together I did the

184
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,550

refer to as synchro view that's actually

188
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,390
a copywriter term level of line i'm

189
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,300
using matts on youtube but the general

190
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,130
idea is to have the presentation large

191
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,719
the person that's doing the talk in the

192
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,240
smaller window and his little pile of

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,280
the bottom normally divine one of those

194
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,920
systems the underground you did if her

195
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,760
quite free I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the price</font>

196
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:24,870
tag on is great at this point yeah so he

197
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,000
has he has single-handedly changed how a

198
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,550
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of conferences actually do their</font>

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,410
video by writing some scripting in this

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:14,860
going on if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

426
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,320
happening which tends to heaven who

427
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,990
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saved the hotel it's got a ring</font>

428
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:25,480
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you called up to register</font>

429
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:27,850
your room and when you did that you told

430
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,169
them outer zone or actually the code was

431
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,059
out 12 a wine and but it's entirely

432
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:34,320
possible that they did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that it</font>

433
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,870
from

434
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,460
correct so one of the ways that we

435
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually are allowed but are able to do</font>

436
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:44,700
this is we have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the certain of a</font>

437
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,919
room nights so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people per night</font>

438
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,590
you know have a room here we don't have

439
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:51,210
to pay as much for con space so it's

440
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,699
really important that we get credit for

441
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,340
you getting up at Ellering here so if

442

nice so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not outer zone I'm just the</font>

981
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:33,890
guy who gets everybody together with a

983
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,660

985
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:44,649
speakers that actually make it happen so

986
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:47,420
I'm only deciding what takes place

987
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:51,499
merely by someone saying hey nobody go

988
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:53,569
on you blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost less than</font>

989
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:56,058
what I've got in my life then we can

990
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:57,619
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing Grover</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> faintly oh that would be cool well</font>

993
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:11,359

994
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:16,759
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down to now is um what is ours on</font>

995
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:19,069

996
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:22,489
independently wealthy and trust me I've

997
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:25,699
dreamed of this many many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

998
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:27,469
be at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Four Seasons right now you</font>

would we've got that money well they're

1003
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:45,410

00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,130
that we would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coolest you're</font>

1007
00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:54,979
available we've been playing with

1008
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:57,250
everything possible but contrary to

1009
00:47:54,979 --> 00:48:00,310
popular belief I am NOT

1010
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,410
I am NOT<font color="#CCCCCC"> dirt-poor that I worked really</font>

1011
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:05,710
hard not to be there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for to be</font>

1012
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:07,149
moderately<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I have enough money I</font>

1013

standing in pump going that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visit</font>

1015
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:17,110
asking so um because the way this is

1016
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually put together however somebody's</font>

1017
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:22,600
paid for out of our pockets it was sky

1018
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:24,430
daughter myself it's basically one of

1019
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things where we're looking at</font>

1020
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,930
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do</font>

1021
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:31,779
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spend I'm trying and things like</font>

1022
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:33,160
that there is no outer zone bank account

1023
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:35,020
where there's this big chunk of change

1024
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,450
you may have a credit card my things out

1025
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> literally is just directly out of</font>

1026
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:44,129
our bank accounts<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott is also the</font>

1027
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,939
exact same way he is the person who is

1028
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:49,200
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> booking the hotel</font>

1029
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,450
getting the dates<font color="#CCCCCC"> its if you follow us</font>

1030
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,950
so Scott is actually responsible for

1031
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:56,290
that if we don't get enough friend count

1032
00:48:53,950 --> 00:49:00,189
he's on the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> theoretically to pay</font>

1033
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:02,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tab on the yahoo tell so there isn't</font>

1034
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,360
like some huge organization that makes

1035
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,520
what's happened it's like yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I</font>

1036
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the your website up i'm</font>

1039
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,470
the sixth time to put it up because you

1040
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys send emails to be and then you said</font>

1041
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:24,220
her she responds to you and it's a bit

1042
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:26,260
so um basically outer zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you guys</font>

1043
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,879
you tell me what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do and</font>

1044
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:32,410
here's some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font>

1045
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,570
kind of look at UM the size that we're

1046
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,870
at about 100 people show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1047
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,670
powder 150 depending on what's going on

1048
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,589
it's kids are any people we don't count

1049
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:43,570
those you know you're on your own it's

1050
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:47,650
only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> button and is he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1051
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:50,890
um some people said<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey no can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you make</font>

1052
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">it larger oh yeah absolutely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

1053
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,120
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at skydog gonna have the entire</font>

1054
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:57,220
infrastructure to do a pull you know

1055
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,190
several thousand person conference

1056
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,259
without a problem but also requires a

1057
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:04,990
lot more money on more things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that front</font>

1058
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,670
it with what we've done we're probably

1059
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:08,538
in four not three green right now and

1060
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,160
then it's not

1061
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:13,349
like I say out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> some you know from the</font>

1062
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairies bank account that's on a credit</font>

1063
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:20,099
card that's out of my pocket it's stuff

1064
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:25,380
like that so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to grow out as</font>

1065
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:27,359
only requires that we probably start

1066
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,920
selling tickets bellowing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

1067
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,420
a system in place called ticketleap

1068
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,309
through the users have all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

1069
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,230
wonderfully but we'd actually have to

1070
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:36,480
sell tickets on the appeals of outer

1071
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:39,210
zones if you show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to donate</font>

1072
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,190

1129
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:54,869
we ought to do but it's not so um what

is in resume got you on the last point

1131
00:52:54,869 --> 00:53:00,900
we a Carolina company kind of kind of

1132
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,760
run into the same thing and you know

1133
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone thinks it's kind of an easy</font>

1134
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,100
question do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bigger do we</font>

1135
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:10,560
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know limit it now but the</font>

1136
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,779
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is you know people say what</font>

1137
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,779
we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it a small you know</font>

1138
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,210
group him but what they don't understand

1139
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,359
is ok to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a small group that</font>

1140
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:24,570
means we have to stop people from coming

1141
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:27,720
to the time I'll putting a liminal yeah

1142
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:30,510
so to keep it small we need to put some

1143
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a limit so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means you make</font>

1144
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:36,000
come to the con but your friends may not

1145
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:38,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make you so now suddenly is</font>

1146
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,570
it a good idea to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep the smaller what</font>

1147
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:44,670
you know let anyone in yeah so it's not

1148
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:48,119
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an easy question but it's</font>

1149
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:50,100
not much to do the coupon that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1150
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,510
tomorrow there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rude yeah and</font>

1151
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:56,069
that's what everyone complains about

1152
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:58,140
exactly I agree so the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shmoocon</font>

1153
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,030
did the first year they did they invited

1154
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,339
all of their friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they call the</font>

1155
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,109
other people and it was like thousand

1156
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,760
people standing there and I went wow

1157
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:07,259
this is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in those</font>

1158
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,330
thousand people said hey you should come

1159
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:11,490
to shmoocon they're nice but that'll be

1160
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:15,720
really cool and then ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales I</font>

1161
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:18,390
think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheese they sold 500 tickets of</font>

1162
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">my 12 seconds literally they have a bank</font>

1163
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:24,690
of servers with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> custom wrote code for</font>

1164
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:26,309
that operate really a maximum potential

1165
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,380
for one hour a year

1166
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:31,049
and they will it<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally will crash</font>

1167
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:32,789
them on a regular basis it's become so

1168
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:34,170
popular because there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500</font>

1169
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">tickets available to the column and</font>

1170
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,039
everybody wants to go and then the crux

1171
00:54:36,569 --> 00:54:40,380
of the situation is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get taken</font>

1172
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,119
your buddy gets to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay screw gun</font>

1173
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,920
sucks man there<font color="#CCCCCC"> go they're saying</font>

1174
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:46,589
they're going hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we have one</font>

1175
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,809
of largest venues and washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC you</font>

1176
00:54:46,589 --> 00:54:51,209
can't find the space to put it on so

1177
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:53,039
then what you end up with is you know

1178
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:54,269
then you're being elitist scumbags or

1179
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,509
something because you're only letting a

00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:44,999
honestly<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing on the property now I</font>

1268
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,739
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a problem with</font>

1269
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:48,310
making a profit on the conference if

1270

its altruistic I have to lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is a</font>

1277
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,610
great thing to do because honestly you

1278
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,820
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a ton of it sitting</font>

1304
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:24,520
no boot camp I think and they started

1305
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,960
get selective and you could show up

1306
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:28,120
unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're a developer you did this</font>

that's they started our campus screen

1308
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,540
you're everything that was the second

1309
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:35,049
iteration who knows what the third

1310
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:37,150
iteration is flat besides holly cow it

1311
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:39,010
was like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-sides you're showing up</font>

1315
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,040
same talk because the guys going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1316
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:49,990
stage shake hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a car go get a</font>

1317
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:53,140
swimsuit and sit by the pool and do this

1318
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:56,109
up so which one do you want to do so ask

hat because their company pays<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

1321
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,569
but just show up you get the rollback of

<font color="#CCCCCC">Interzone the debate about whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>
