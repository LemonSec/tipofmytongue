domains to actually do a zone transfer

172
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,550
on as a test the longest time on what i

173
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,120
use was that you jus de<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's</font>

174
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:18,310
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> german university uh regardless</font>

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,670
and universe that much to his own

178
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,310
transfer for good reason but that one

and see how it's supposed to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

184
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,600
way you can demo it without dropping

00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,310
hey timeout exceeded and whatever you

00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">get that from that's one hop along half</font>

285
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:16,000
well which usually keep you cumming that

286
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,010
time to live and keep getting one step

287

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably over simplifying this I'm i</font>

289
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,829
crack and correcting later I've got the

290
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,620
hop into eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hopefully have</font>

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,140
names of those didn't pops along the way

294

<font color="#CCCCCC">so it might have an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who these</font>

295
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,839
people appear with and so forth so it'd

296
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">be awesome actually me here's just an</font>

300
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,500
let's not talk about breaking our call

301
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,250
asking some time later often complicated

302
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,380
ramifications for breaking barriers are

303
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:02,490
seeds but my bias you called issues

304
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,110
I mean I suppose you could say this

305
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worried about my SD</font>

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accomplish so</font>

308
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,209
well I mean generally not go see<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

ICMP messages that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows sins for</font>

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,910
UDP ones that you need to us so yeah you

320
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,670
can't do that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's going to</font>

323
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,180
it cuz you can sit there and watch your

932
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,950
but I think I've replicated most of us

933
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,869
from these two in mind but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

934
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:31,069
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last several months they may</font>

00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:35,730
computers will talk about my check out

937
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:37,980
Kevin Johnson and Thomas and did one on

938
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,329
social zombies it's worth checking out

939
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,049
and you know finding out information
