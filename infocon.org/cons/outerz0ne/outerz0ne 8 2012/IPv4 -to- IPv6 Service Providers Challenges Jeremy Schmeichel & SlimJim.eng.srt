beckon from the late 80s Early 90s and

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,329
the 1990 there was an official RFC for

IP version potted never really formally

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,220
adopted because ipv4

51

already in place and nobody ever dream

52
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,420
we'd actually run out of ip's nobody

53
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,160
ever dream back then we have all the

IP version 6 co-star RFC it's evolved

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,700
greatly over years they had read in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,730

70
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,730
to see it left a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of address space</font>

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">the RFC divided the initial defined in a</font>

short vb6 specification it's greatly

73
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,500
evolved over the years so in ipv6 the

74
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,600
address size changed from a 32-bit

75

regular binary addresses 128-bit

80
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,650
specification versus approximately I

81
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,630
think that's four billion to 94 million

82
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,020
167,000 296 address is available in IP

84
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,710
figured out that there's approximately

one IP address for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> three square</font>

89
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:01,250
you can provide the entire IP version 4

90
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:04,070
range to device every second or that in

91
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,230
years and how do we be saved as a number

92
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,510
of high passes in the ipv6 rain shine

93
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,690
roughly basically we're going to go for

94
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,370
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little while once we get it hopefully</font>

don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP version 4 space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

97
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,420
we'll see

98
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,349
so when we get into ipv4 versus IP

99
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,380
version 6 this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the major</font>

all that stuff is actually have really

106
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,930
used and IP version 4 it's there but the

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,030
nice thing about having a simplified

108
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,520
headers it actually reduces the

109
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,200
processing time per packet so your

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,570
router your switches that are passing

look like tell them you come from a base

so that Aaron over the other global

internet registries won't hand you an

ipv6 there's only two types there used

197
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,169
to be three types I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in a</font>

into it but it's there it's going to

211
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,040
look like the text in right there at the

212
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,890
80 Cohen Cohen one of the rules and IP

213
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,839
version 6 is you can skip sets of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros</font>

214
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,590
by using a double colon but you can only

00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:19,320
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once then a remainder of the</font>

219
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:31,560
there and so like I be version 4 on

220
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,920
their supper observe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> B's in ipv6 as</font>

221
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,479
well I have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time too long</font>

222
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get into during the development for</font>

223
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,790
the official ipv6 RFC and this wasn't

224
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,650
that long ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was back in</font>

225
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,270
2007-2008 so I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> 34 years ago there</font>

226
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,480
was something known as a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

227
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,270
address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we know is private</font>

228
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,770
space today was a separate RFC developer

229
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,780
site local addresses was kind of the

230
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,819
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were just competing</font>

231
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,740
RFC's both of these has since been

232
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,590
removed from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> official RFC / IP</font>

233
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,180
version 6 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially it</font>

234
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,950
supports net and one of the reason we're

235
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,560
trying to transition to IP version 6 is

236
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,100
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that completely that is</font>

237
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,030
currently seen as a hindrance innovation

238
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,250
aside from all the other issues that

239
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,839
hole but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to get</font>

240
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of it might be written</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 which is</font>

241
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,620
part of the difficulty that we're

242
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,960
currently having that was originally a

243
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">band-aid because of lack of addresses it</font>

244
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,480
did have some minor security animal you

245
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,450
know abilities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general nap was</font>

246
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,730
the early on man day because over apple

247
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,960
running out of addresses what we do

248
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,090
we're still working on conversion safe

249
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,590
said honestly IP version 6 has gone

250
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:39,240
through so many changes it's hard for

251
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,510
the vendors to keep up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

252
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,830
support because the RCC change kind of

253
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,700
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we first started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing later</font>

254
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,840
to let in or raft<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop to drive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

255
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,990
that's kind of how we have to do with

256
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,820
we've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with idea version 6</font>

257
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,600
but the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms and RFC's is is</font>

258
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,339
of all being written

259
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,560
with is each level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our seat isn't</font>

260
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:08,589
existing long enough it wouldnt to catch

261
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,268
up to me so let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide all</font>

262
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:12,759
right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really 20 of that</font>

263
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,649
image there on the corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just typed</font>

264
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:18,300
in IP version 6<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google and I popped</font>

265
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,350
up so I just add ipv6 selfie doesn't

266
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it was perfectly good hitting right</font>

267
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,889
that's why I pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> that picture next okay</font>

268
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,870
um panic button on the top there's been

269
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:31,300
severe one very<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on for us we</font>

270
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,040
actually see the screenshot on the

bottom right<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand corner from Fox News</font>

273
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,459
everybody was so anyway currently we are

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,110
out of IP version 4 enter space on the

anything about it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just basically</font>

284
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,240
an entire range that starts with one

285
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,850
number it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still providing allocations</font>

286
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,790
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard at this pace right</font>

287
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:25,149
now oh the company that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ibps</font>

288
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party engineering data</font>

289
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:28,839
provisioning services for variety of

290
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,779
cable companies throughout North America

291
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:34,089
at curbing South America and so I work

292
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,730
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering and one of my job's is to</font>

293
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:39,670
actually assist companies get address

294
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,500
space if necessary and so we helped out

295
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,509
with the air and application hell valve

296
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,149
is all the IP justification forms all

297
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:48,519
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> good stuff it comes down to right</font>

298
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:50,350
now you absolutely have to be what's

299
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,060
called dual home basically enough to

300
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,310

and level 3 or two separate upstream

303
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,029

have that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have used at</font>

307
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,410
you have to document all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff out</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

310
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,410
space and then they might give you space

311
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,300
depending on how often you request it

312
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,459
how much you currently have what it

313
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,229
might just tell you to suck it up and

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you never something a couple years back</font>

the reasons for IP version 6 are here

<font color="#E5E5E5">yet aside from the general fact we're</font>

running out of my puberty more space

356
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:58,329
part of the ipv4 shortage was due to

poor allocations initially Asia and

358
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:02,620
Africa when the initial ipv4 space was

359
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:05,019
created and being handed out during

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that net has issues of games i</font>

430
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:03,620
mean you know some games don't work on

431
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,408
that depending on how your configuration

432
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,779
is set up potential future features are

433
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,850
ipsec everywhere there a protocol

434
00:18:08,779 --> 00:18:14,000
security basically security encrypted

435
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,189
within every packet future mobility you

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,200
can have an IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign your advice</font>

version 6 transition issues who the

443
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,110
thought going from a 32-bit basic

444
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:43,490
address 128 that hexadecimal itís we

445
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:44,959
have any problems right<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it doesn't</font>

446
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a fair that's a very high number</font>

447
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,980
32 right you wouldn't you wouldn't think

448
00:18:49,509 --> 00:18:54,679
but anyway how the Internet in general

449
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,629
has been slow to adopt ipv6 there are a

450
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,519
great number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> squibb sites that do not</font>

451
00:18:56,629 --> 00:19:00,769
function on the ipv6 internet obviously

452
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,379
the big guys like Google Facebook eBay

453
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:05,179
actually no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you de l think is fully up</font>

454
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:07,969
you do v6 complain<font color="#CCCCCC"> like thank you</font>

455
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,980
participate 96 bday then they shouted

456
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:14,840
again yeah so they wrote yeah basically

457
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,279
until like all of the surface products

458
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,230
and stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into later start to</font>

459
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:24,169
adopt ipv6 more widely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess most of</font>

460
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,870
your fortune 500 are capable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic</font>

461
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:28,159
instant<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need something</font>

462
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,779
but remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

463
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">trysting this goes back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS</font>

464

quality raters it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a simple</font>

465
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,220
solution we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tighten IP addresses</font>

466
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">in tor browser we type name</font>

467
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:44,299
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more moving parts DNS</font>

468
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,428
names addresses or security there's so

469
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:48,408
much more to it than just changing your

470
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,460
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> posle</font>

471
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:51,799
officer you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> send an address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

472
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,679
more it's a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult than that</font>

473
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,510
and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to base you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

474
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,559
real basic it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed like easy solution</font>

475
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">then you start adding all the</font>

476
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:04,250
complications get yourself very pretty

477
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:06,139
boi pretty deep right and so the service

478
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,230
provider industry has been excessively

479
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,030
slow to adopt IP version 6 on say the

480
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,309
primary reason in my opinion is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost</font>

481
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:15,139
is too sheer<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and then the knowledge</font>

482
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:17,389
gap in between because obviously you're

483
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,240
going again from a 32-bit address to a

484
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,830
128-bit hexadecimal address obviously it

485
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,390
regards to all the dns issues we don't

486
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,220
type IP addresses there's no way you're

487
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,539
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to type 128-bit hexadecimal</font>

the internet well<font color="#CCCCCC"> pervade you have one</font>

490
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,730

493
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,330
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this hope of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of the</font>

494
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,370
consumer and of the service provider as

495
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,770
with anything the general attitude has

496
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,510
been complicit if it ain't broke it's

497
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,070
quickly becoming we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it</font>

498
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,500
before at all bro let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

499
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,720
consumer issues first the number one

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,669
hurdle IP version 6 worldwide update

501
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,169
adaptation and consumer perspective it

502
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:02,990
is anybody yes right track that's part

503
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,500
of it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> patient routers that we'd like</font>

compatibilities through their network to

523
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,619
you or the fact that their help desk

isn't able support you and you're not

this presentation with a further but

535
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:24,389
basically if we all had IP version 6

536
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,469
addresses today we still probably

537

wouldn't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do everything you do</font>

709
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,129

711
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,360
customer harm land so they're kind of

712
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,939
caught in the middle because they're not

713

flip side they're really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

718
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,678

719
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,049
kind of where they're stuck right now is

720
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,620
I can't spend a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

00:29:54,090 --> 00:30:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">places you could focus on to fix the</font>

734
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:08,010
again transfers back into what we do one

743
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,780
complex and challenging<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this comes</font>

744
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">back into the hole when I've been filled</font>

745
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,139
for 25-30 years and I'm creating some

grid ng which not a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use</font>

750
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,060
rip from a service provider perspective

751
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,179
but believe it or not it is used from

752
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,919
time to time<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VF version 3 yeah dr p</font>

753
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,220
which is the Cisco proprietary protocol

00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:59,650
for IP version 6 Isis for IP version 6

755

760
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,850
your upstream provider has to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

support<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ID be safe skiing all i</font>

need stuff server service provider

763
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,930
software must support all the required

764
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,580
ipv6 protocols on top of the hardware

765
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:23,410
the service provider must obtain an ipv6

766
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,790
allocation from<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron which actually</font>

767
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,930
isn't very difficult right now because

768
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,060
they're basically saying here please

769
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this use it please they're giving</font>

773
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:41,500
here you go so and then the service

774
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:45,070
provider substrate carrier must be able

775
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,990
to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v6 advertisements via the</font>

wrong with that yep that's right that's

911

everybody everything really but from a

915
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,860
service providers perspective there's

916
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,740
something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalia anybody hurtful</font>

932
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,830
problem to have some sort of similar

regulation outside the US and Europe

934

have to give you a couple / 20 boards
