289
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,340
so um we kind of don't know up front

290
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,470
they're showing up we take them good

291
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,760

293
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,170
but we put our money out front hoping

294
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people show up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good time</font>

295
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:12,880
and donate to help us catch up on what

296
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:14,980
we actually paid so um usually that

297
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,620
number is anywhere between twenty and

298
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,740
thirty dollars per person that we spend

299
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,290
for you to be able to come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in town</font>

300
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:26,230
that sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know geez 20 or 30</font>

301
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,870
pups we have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport things</font>

302
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,200
we have searched for a bit now all we

303
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,330
have

304
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,250
trying to send everywhere we have the

305
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,260
hotel space it has to be paid for I

306
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:39,340
don't know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed gasps sucks</font>

in rehab I have an SUV then bring a by

308
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,830
my a trailer that's loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> too they held</font>

309
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,110
the stuff 55 was as fast as i could go

310
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,840
it wasn't a suggestion it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go</font>

311
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,390
downhill and I get season so I ran

312
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,650
through but you guessed it here all

313
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,750
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things where all those things kind</font>

314
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,329
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up now I'm not standing up</font>

315
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,130
you're saying all I want to do this no I

316
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,310
mean I spent more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money going to that</font>

317
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:04,690
time well actually your things about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

318
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,560
I probably shouldn't talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prayer</font>

319
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:11,560
but I spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of cash go DEFCON end</font>

320
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,958
time with my friends that's what I go

323
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,089
people that I know they're so the end

324
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:24,910
result is if I spent two money and never

325
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,770
made anything back a year or two of that

326
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,260
I would say it was working haven't had

327
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:33,370
taken up so much it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be bad</font>

business to keep and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> them but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

329
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,570
sort of the dollar figure we've put

330

368
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,760
but I was going to sad settled on a

369
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,550
tiered system like you don't contribute

370
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,290
and you get I badge and maybe water

371
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,570
bottle and become you can get a shirt

372
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">but again well then methodology was</font>

373
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,040
applied to not a common the problem with

374
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,660
that is they said it's 70 others to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

378
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,890
you then make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> start belief and well</font>
