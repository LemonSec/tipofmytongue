solutions finding lives that really

24

38
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,430
doesn't score<font color="#E5E5E5"> any with us baby so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,210
do have some other ways of getting

41
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:09,609
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ways</font>

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:14,440
Oh advances on there but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

some mushrooms is what we called mixing

44

or be excellent and it provides a boot

45
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:30,609
option from the network this allows if

46
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,170
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer supports it to allow us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

47
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,380

49
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,150
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> device I want to talk to the</font>

50
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:44,260
network server and get the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

51
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:49,860
want to run at the initial started

52
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,859
machine from this network server so

53
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:07,000
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> irritating that's the officers</font>

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:10,630
not like a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> write-up so to set up</font>

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,880
exit music what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is get a</font>

56
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:18,549
server setup which was 23 LOL so sorry

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:21,700
then if you want to use I solo CD or an

58
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:25,630
install CD for your favorite abou to

59
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,810
where I the end that put it on to set it

60
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,319
up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain way of answer them yet the</font>

61
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,790
client machine from the network card

62
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,950
pick whatever actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with other</font>

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:43,180
communities you and then you're going to

64
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:46,170
do this all<font color="#CCCCCC"> lit up so here we're so does</font>

65
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,970
codes don't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm sorry um</font>

66
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,679
mostly you got a pxe support over the

67
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,019
client that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big thing that that's</font>

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,260
WordGirl luck but the standard is from

69
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:59,590
99 so most commuters will have that on

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:03,459
there yes it a dhcp server or calls it

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:07,209
is that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

72
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:10,660
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they started the TFT decline is</font>

73
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:13,599
going to send the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the PCD</font>

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:18,070
server said kid and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

75
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:22,039
head sree PP server to send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> crystal</font>

76
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:25,010
so we can do it but straight into an

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,350
operating system but a lot of times you

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:32,570
want a bootloader to sort of pick as you

79
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,100
stroke so the phc<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam Scott 0 file is</font>

80
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,680
basically that's just move over

especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network grow like a thing</font>

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,310
or the iso<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux that comes on strong</font>

83
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">cds it just gets going that you pick the</font>

that the options on the ninky points to

00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,660
that's or stuff the many choices that

89
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,510
you get are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come from some</font>

90
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,400
configuration files that you can modify

91
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,270
or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of go with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards</font>

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,890
affair not you also to customize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

93
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,650
if you can make a server where you had

94
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:20,840
10 options you can boot up a password

there we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> route up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> citigroup</font>

102
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:49,430
installed utilities you can solve the

client or the solid operating system to

104
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:57,440
contact but we do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sure that</font>

105
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,060
we if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's one thing</font>

research the repositories that your own

108
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,280
so the demons all piece of software

109

doesn't give traveler to the server that

110

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,789
Linux which was a great product ever

145
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,860
seen it in practices anything that's the

146
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:52,068
one it's got the clonezilla server

147

148
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:59,179
said the clonezilla and this will smoke

152
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:06,919
come back to me it's not really

153
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:09,349
sophisticated that some of the ones I'm

154
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,748
thinking but is that a racket us back up

for 20 x dollars for windows or

156
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:19,639
something but with the business mode

157
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,259
food kinetics in the clonezilla you can

would look at tftp which deity digas all

179
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:28,079

183
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,420
or change it to something else I get

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,639
sometimes tired if I could borrow out

185
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,229
before you can say a lot of times I'll

186
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,910
set it up to a different directly but

187
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:51,179
whatever grade 3 is you just need to

it's not your regular server two things

208
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,579
is that you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set a static IP</font>

209
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:53,939
for that for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ECP work properly and</font>

00:10:53,939 --> 00:11:00,000
if your equipment in the lab you don't

212
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:03,269
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have computers from other places</font>

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,430
possibly graduate dns dhcp stuff from

your circumstance just working on

with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the hall so install</font>

217
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:24,060
let's um either the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XE p 3 1 or the ICS</font>

219
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,369
there the main thing is that we'll have

220
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:33,180
to edit the configuration file dhcp be

221
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:35,129
calm in the important cities are the

222
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,519
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> server service cannot see that at</font>

223
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:41,279
all from this angle i'm not sure the

224
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">color shown up so there's an X server</font>

225
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,230
setting which needs to be the saving of

226
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:50,040
your server and then the important thing

227
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,170
is it is file name which says this is

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,569
the file to send to clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just report forever so that's that's</font>

234
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:18,059
sort of the key thing this ties the

235
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:21,329
scarf from the violent tftp is we serve

236
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,399
the HCL tells it to this is what you're

239
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:34,729
where to go and then we said of apache

you're strong Apache Apaches is also in

248
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:04,100
in too much but we need files for and

249
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:07,280
this is the part that we have to put a

250
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:11,600
few pieces together if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do</font>

251
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:15,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for gluttony I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even tried</font>

city rather than the standard desktop is

255

happened here<font color="#CCCCCC"> your she was walking now</font>

277
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:54,949
we round to the ranges so we actually

278
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,960
mount high so we just need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy that</font>

279
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">or start going to get to the point we're</font>

to the file system somewhere could be

282
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,359
even where I usually just make up a

283
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,660
