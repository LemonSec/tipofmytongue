the industry since 1998 everyone here

80
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so so on to the top now this</font>

81
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,539
talk usually structured<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of in the</font>

82
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,490
reversal rate is now so if I if I true

83
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,750
up and think something's next we i

84
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,120
actually just met through

85
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:35,620
I'm sorry so but anyway the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:39,760
a is a kit of sorts also now call it a

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,830
half a box of basically a collection of

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,240
utilities that a physical social

89
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:49,060
engineer we use in their health and the

90
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,220
whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that I wanted to</font>

91
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,320
collect these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put it into a</font>

92
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,870
kit that I could ship across the country

93
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,090
because believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not we have more</font>

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,220
social engineering business that I can

95
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,989
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself so we have another</font>

96
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,970
consultant to it and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to be</font>

97
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,030
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of ship this kit and</font>

98
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,310
so I don't know three<font color="#CCCCCC"> or four years ago</font>

99
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,280
I started assembling these things and

100
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">just different pieces and parts and so</font>

101
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,039
so now I've created this kid so what I'm

102
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,620
going to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of take you</font>

103
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,300
through what's in it quickly because

104
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,310
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff in it and there's</font>

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:28,090

109
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,370
highlight a few of the cooler tools that

110
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:42,010
are in the kit at least I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

111
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,810
technical in that time so and then I

283
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,990
magnetized networks element some kind of

284
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,290
magic can also do to add a<font color="#CCCCCC"> part but the</font>

285
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,120
really cool thing in my mind is you

286
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,099
don't necessarily have to be seeing

287
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,080
their monitoring your server on the

288
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,870
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding the connection happens</font>

289
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,870
and you can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you don't have</font>

290
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this leads you to a little bit</font>

291
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,830
o real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I said it's just a</font>

292
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:58,839
little quick nice convenient thing that

293
00:14:46,830 --> 00:15:01,510
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so so with</font>

294
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:03,370
the lighting the lighting is can feel a

295
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,500
little bit rough to see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> but all</font>

296
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:10,180
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what you see on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand</font>

297
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,279
side is it is an app on my phone is a

298
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,739
screenshot of my phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright my</font>

299
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:18,250
android phone the home baked and then on

300
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:22,480
the right-hand side is the is an ssh

301
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:27,760
session with a server on here so when

302
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,220
the pump blood starts up<font color="#E5E5E5"> home place</font>

303
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,939
starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> up it connects to the server on</font>

304
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

305
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,190
and this is all configurable but

306
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:38,170
essentially we did when it creates a

307
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:42,190
connection all you see on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

308
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:48,250
server is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a port open okay in this case</font>

309
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">for 3333 yeah okay and basically this</font>

310
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:53,350
little historical<font color="#E5E5E5"> night right no big</font>

311
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal so he cranks up this connection on</font>

312
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:00,190
on 30 30 30 30 and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> often indicates</font>

313
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,750
with whatever user you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it uses like</font>

314
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,320
digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificates so you don't you</font>

315
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,390
hassle animosity because so-and-so you

316
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,690
see the pump blood okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what</font>

317
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,780
happens is it sends an email to your

318
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone at your provider which is</font>

master I'm ready right kind of cool very

327
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:42,040
convenient then you just go and you you

328
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:45,520
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a local ssh to that port 3333 oh</font>

329
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:49,329

created this it's a lot like what they

349
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:03,039
did was said but it kind of goes into

350
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,809
it's just for programming that easy and

351
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,700
so is he's got about 12 different

352
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:08,530
choices of different payloads you can do

353
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,470
anything he made it a little bit more

354
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:14,620

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept if you're including for</font>

367
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:17,320
you to choose payloads kind of odd that

368
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:22,870
a long time ago right yeah I've seen

369
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:25,418
yourself yeah there's well yeah I guess

370
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:30,340
I guess my point for pointing out

371
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:32,700
affiliate<font color="#E5E5E5"> um is is this is usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

372
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,699
can use with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know being kind of</font>

373
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:39,789
annuvin you have a girl it being a

374
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,950
non-covered right oh because pushing the

375
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,250
code to the TT is probably the easy part

376
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,230
was hit and all that so it basically

377
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:52,690
looked a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is creating a nice</font>

378
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,370
work so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> universe them now but what</font>

379
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,940
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight here as well is</font>

380
00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:00,250
for the heck guys created this

381
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,990
which they created this little scripting

382
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,590
language which is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limit of my</font>

383
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:09,789
coma knowledge and I'm gonna totally

384
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:12,189
stupid but oh but so they create the

385
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:14,350
scripting language though that I mean

386
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,389
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it's like you typed</font>

387
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,959
in string and need you type of like

388
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:22,870
character you want in too tight

389
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,590
literally in a UT type<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

390
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:30,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">pesky in Turkey so it's truly you know</font>

391
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:34,418
truly basic so and I have a little I

392
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:37,240
have a little demo here or a group a

393
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:42,220
load of all was kind of interesting in

394
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:46,179
the dougie<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so my first point though</font>

395
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,600
I guess is uh you can you can put this

396
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:51,940
as the ducky year so so essentially

397
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:57,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming this thing is just it's just</font>

398
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,759
taking a notepad and saving a file and

399
00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:04,740
then using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the duck encoder to create a</font>

400
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:08,590
big ball and saving it on SD card is

401
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,100
pretty much that simple right so what I

402
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:16,449
do is I use this little SD card to USB

403
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,428
adapter to push the code to it and then

404
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll call you in the ducky and then I</font>

405
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:23,919
found this USB Drive that i had laying

406
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:26,229
around that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was able to separate</font>

407
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,909
without actually breaking it so i could

408
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,750
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it back together and so I</font>

409
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:35,889
store I even<font color="#E5E5E5"> store my little USB to the</font>

410
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">SD card in the same compartment of the</font>

411
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:42,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">USB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive so that way I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with me</font>

412
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,279
and if I decide to change palos you know

413
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:47,830
it's for a moment I can always change

414
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,840
palos likes it in the bathroom including

415
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,928
or something it will behave chain

416
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,939
payload figure out something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's so</font>

417
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,529
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is been all kind of a blur all right</font>

418
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't you get wrong impressive there's</font>

419
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:02,649
all you were shelled and getting around

420
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,889
ad all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I came across a</font>

421
00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:08,799
payload that someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> coded and I thought</font>

422
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:11,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was kind of cute so i plug in it easy</font>

423
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,679

little gap<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so along with the</font>

theme of heavy enhancement for this real

548

quick or a quick review of our body

549
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,200
hugging everybody knows chris magic

550
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,270
redundant questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess came with</font>

551
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,320
the scores but prismatic really brought

into the mainstream of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your RFID coning</font>

553
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:28,110
essentially the device just just acts

554
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,780
like a leader Peter dieses<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID card the</font>

555

course that it has a play mode right it

556
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,990
just plays back<font color="#CCCCCC"> back hard right but the</font>

557
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:39,360
problem if that is what if you home

558
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,540
somebody's car you only has access to

559
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,510
ability but if they don't have access to

560
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,850
data center or whatever sin severe you

561
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,160
want to get in well then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font>

back out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plumbing somebody else's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">car</font>

564

to clone somebody else's<font color="#CCCCCC"> car he said we</font>

578
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:41,260
lost you have to do that I can't we just

579
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,170
group tours the employee ID portion of

580
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:48,820
the garden I mean it's just a whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

581
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:51,220
guess a wee bit for bit character you

582
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:54,669
know code that this thing is real<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

583
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:57,610
right so it was encoded<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

584
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:00,190
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a flash it's just an earlier</font>

585
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:03,250
class you just update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross mark 3</font>

586
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:05,980
firmware with the discard where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

587
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,140
created and so that when you press the

588
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,630
play button instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just replaying</font>

589
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:15,970
the one card it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will play it</font>

590
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,200
will keep the facility ID the same and

591
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:23,860
it will replay your card but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

592
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,450
decrement the card ID by one and then

593
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,000
play that for a second and then

594
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:35,850
decrement the card<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to play</font>

595
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:39,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent right so why definite knew</font>

596
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:42,909
it was the wrong use of the hall exactly

597
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:46,300
exactly began who got the system we most

598

<font color="#CCCCCC">harder issued in my clocks 111 they gon</font>

599
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,669
do when you've got the system and

600
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:56,440
implemented i'll probably issued himself

601
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:59,260
a card first or at least like a a engine

602
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,150
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup group to access of</font>

603
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,850
everything card and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font>

604
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,320
issuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many probably issues</font>

605
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:07,719
security guards that need access

606
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:10,270
everything involve<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and it finally</font>

607
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,809
comes the card<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you plum which might</font>

608

have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 99th or the you know</font>

609
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:20,129
whatever 2000 person who got a card and

610
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,689
so I work at your way backwards in the

611
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,820
reverse direction you'll get to a better

612
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,250
card<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right someone who got had their</font>

615
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:38,100
about this particular this device that

changes card numbers the card reader

619
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:50,110
that you're playing on beat so it's a

656
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,779
these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nets utility that I think</font>

657
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,689
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just this way too cool it's called</font>

658
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:36,659
konbu and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way your predator</font>

659
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,749
category boundaries of<font color="#CCCCCC"> futures he said I</font>

participating in the murder of done news

662
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:50,220

663
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:53,039
does as far as i can tell the developers

664

666
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,990
guess understanding essentially what it

667
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,360
does temporarily modifies the system

668
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:07,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">lubrication right that believe me are a</font>

670
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially ejects a little bit of code</font>

671
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:17,399
that tells it whenever whenever receive

673
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,969
password so it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what</font>

674
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,309
actually you type in now there's a

do the off and stuff but yeah the

776
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:28,019
defense against this is full disk

777
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,480
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tried that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

780
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,710
encryption where there's actually a

781
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,930
password right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> most I mean so</font>

782
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,160
some implementations of full disk

783
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,109
encryption they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> some even for the</font>

784
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:48,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">password so you just kind of press enter</font>

this this laptop you grow it into the

844
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:56,160
environment you turn it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

845
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:58,890
ladies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you turn it on and the</font>

846
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,080
other scripts go out and create a little

847
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,359
reverse SSH tunnel to your machine

848
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:06,630
listening on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay dislike</font>

849
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:09,500
of own blood um but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to</font>

850
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,790
creating this reverse shell it also um

851
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,450
cranks out these little more for words

852
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:16,110
which I love and I hear the bigger with

853
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:19,640
doing

854
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:24,540
I guess it's called reverse or 40 / ssh

855
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:28,500
right okay okay coat see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to help</font>

856
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:32,400
jumbo PCM all right to me that's another

857
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:35,550
magnet moment right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pfm that you</font>

858
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,670
can actually for a board that's on your

859
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:42,990
internet server not necessarily to the

860
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:46,740
ssh client but blue vs-si spine to

861
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:50,129
another machine that's like this 90 this

862
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:52,680
is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool so also essentially what i</font>

863
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,230
did here is pretty little reverse tunnel

864
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,230
so I can control it if I need to but

865
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:01,470
mostly just<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating these two listeners</font>

866
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,840
on my ear at us that that port forward

867
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:06,000
through millennium to the internal

868
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:09,560
interface management interface of the

869
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,470
esxi box why<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internal interface</font>

870
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:17,400
because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> VM may not know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

871
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:20,879
address was assigned to the esxi box

872
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,150
right so it doesn't have to because

873
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,400
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> listens on my being added the</font>

874
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:29,520
interval matted address so i can hard

875
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,360
code that it doesn't have to know it so

876
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,890
that gives me maybe sphere you know

877
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:39,180
management interface that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can start up</font>

878
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:42,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">ians and so down and autism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense</font>

879
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so with a demo it doesn't want them</font>

880
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:52,020
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> times but the idea if maybe later you</font>

881
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:57,300
want to see the demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> kickin we can kind</font>

882
00:45:52,020 --> 00:46:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of get that I've got a couple of network</font>

883
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:04,260
setup to simulate here all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um we</font>

884
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a bit there any questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>
