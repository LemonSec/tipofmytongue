1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:09,120
yeah well I I wish I could say that that

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,070
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but no you do have bad sectors</font>

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,290
it's usually they just get completely

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,420
obliterated and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get control of</font>

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,380
them at all so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:24,359
problem it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is worse yeah it's worse on a</font>

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,519
data recovery into yes we have a problem

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,590
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if the MBR is messed up it</font>

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,359
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently look for partition</font>

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,920
structures that the MBR doesn't know so

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,930
you could hand build one if you wanted

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,399
to they are writing a partition search

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,460
feature keep in mind this is all beta

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,230
right now so they're writing a partition

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,920
search feature for those same partitions

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,199
so that is a that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently a problem</font>

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,180
though it will try to do in ECC recovery

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,410
on the MBR though so for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,129
if there's one bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> to still an error</font>

20
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll try to recover from it so but this</font>

21
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,420
tool does some other things and this is

22
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,230
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of the demo I've prepared so</font>

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,570
if it blows up if if I actually wanted

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do something with heads there's</font>

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,110
actually a function<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually looks</font>

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,060
at heads and you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and off bad</font>

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,350
heads and so you can individually it'll

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,119
individually search through the zone

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,830
tables and it will build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the zone table</font>

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,000
listing so anybody who knows what Zeke a

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,000
vis will know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,680
Bonnie plus plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's building is using</font>

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,540
zone tables and it's using zone tables

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,250
to identify all the heads and so

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,770
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how long sometimes just</font>

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,869
take an hour to actually run but it'll

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,280
build a list of all of the heads and you

38
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,049
can individually turn off a head so

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,479
those drives to have a clunking error

40
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,740
but they still come ready if anybody

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,030
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> on talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about like three</font>

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes after you start to drive and</font>

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,570
it's going clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk

44
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,799
and then it comes ready and it looks

45
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can copy files but then it</font>

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,100
starts airing out and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,159
that's a bad head and you can actually

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn off the bad head image all the good</font>

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,420
stuff and then go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to deal</font>

50
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the bad head or make a new head or</font>

51
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,840
do something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that</font>

52
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint replaced the head but so in a</font>

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,110
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> what will happen was when it's</font>

54
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,908
done with the zone table it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me</font>

55
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,140
an option to turn off individual head so

56
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,680
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this one's only got three heads</font>

57
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,420
or four heads I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only seen I see for</font>

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,420
go by so

59
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,989
yeah you don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the other head</font>

60
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,640
so you can turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off at it'll actually</font>

61
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:20,890
fill in the holes that'll fill in the

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,569
gaps so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's done if I actually</font>

63
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,089
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and I actually looked</font>

64
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,708
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process I actually now have four</font>

65
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,630
heads I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down and turn</font>

66
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,190
off an individual head this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

67
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:35,290
tool in this price range which actually

68
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,819
does that yes it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll read</font>

69
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,890
whatever that head is assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

70
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,690
will skip all of that data but that does

71
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,640
not mean that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have like like</font>

72
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,560
zones are actually divided up according

73
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to numbers of LBA blocks that are</font>

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,430
consecutive so zones it may still be two

75
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,079
Meg's you may still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good word</font>

76
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:57,160
document even though one head might be

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:03:00,360
missing so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to do secure</font>

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">a snow but you can do that with floppy</font>

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:09,910
yeah yeah it'll wipe a drive it'll do a

80
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,290
wipe drive but it's not doing secure

81
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">race so it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anything with</font>

82
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,630
with bad bad sectors bad blocks from

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,019
that standpoint for wiping them but any

84
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">other questions so anyway I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

85
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:22,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool I think this is the</font>

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,850
direction that everything's going with

87
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,200
data recovery tools and so we're now

88
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,820
actually kind of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this merger</font>

89
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,440
that we didn't have before we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

90
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,459
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the drive and then you</font>

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and do something like run our</font>

92
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,579
studios or some other data recovery

93
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,200
software to read what you've recovered

94
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,510
and you wouldn't know what your bad

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,880
blocks were which files like if I had 25

96
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,709
bad sectors I'd have no idea what I had

97
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,180
but here I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good percentage and</font>

98
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll get a list and i'll know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

99
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,209
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at specifically if it's good or</font>

100
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,299
bad so but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had so thank</font>

101
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,299
you

102
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,440
you

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,340
you
