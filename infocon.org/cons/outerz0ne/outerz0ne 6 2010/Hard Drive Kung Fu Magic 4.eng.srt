1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,399
sequentially down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disc as it's going</font>

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:12,480
it is laying the data back out exactly

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,768
in the same order that it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from but</font>

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,350
it's laying it out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination</font>

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk so the destination disk is actually</font>

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,880
almost instantaneously sector by sector

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,948
as this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being read is being written</font>

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,480
directly to the destination disk so even

9
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,230
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plug on this right now it</font>

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,470
would pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up where it left off so I can</font>

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,840
do that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I'll read the</font>

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,570
configuration in this entire map I mean

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,879
literally I can like stop this I can you

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:46,079
know quit a program unplug the equipment

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:47,550
walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start it back up and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font>

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">be right where it was where it left off</font>

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,760
and you'll actually be able to continue

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,020
from where you actually left off and it

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:59,070
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue back from that exact</font>

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:01,109
location that's correct it writes the

21
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,870
profile a<font color="#CCCCCC"> depth it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has a flag</font>

22
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,280
has this map and it's an lb a map and

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,170
there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flag for every single</font>

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">sector and it tells what the status of</font>

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,189
that flag was and that configuration is

26
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,740
loaded into device every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it starts</font>

27
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,820
and it does it by identifying the serial

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,100
number and stuff basically of the

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,899
original device so when that device is

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,309
bound to this device as long as those

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,170
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are the only ones that are</font>

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,630
online it reads the original

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,000
configuration file if I put a new source

34
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,710
drive on then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told it to do that</font>

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
it would say they don't match<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,710
would just automatically overwrite the

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,900
drive again which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal in a data</font>

38
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,329
recovery process the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it can do any</font>

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,150
drive but this process that i'm showing

40
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:47,579
you only supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> MFDs right now so it</font>

41
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,770
only supports ntfs normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would tell</font>

42
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,570
the imager to do the entire drive and it

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,310
will do it like I said kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any</font>

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,130
order but including<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage or whatever</font>

45
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,719
so right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end of that</font>

46
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,000
particular chunk of data now at the end

47
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll turn around and go backwards it'll</font>

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,299
do three passes with different changes

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,919
in between each paths I can do four

50
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,780
passes and make it do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything I want</font>

51
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,369
and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it turn off power if I</font>

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,259
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure I can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

53
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,810
steps in between so I actually have the

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,980
ability to choose like a what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,319
scenario so

56
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,329
actually say how fast what time how many

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,310
milliseconds but if I actually got a

58
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,170
sector that actually had a particular

59
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,489
type of error which I've covered in

60
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,409
other talks that have actually done what

61
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,250
types of errors I could actually tell it

62
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,660
then to power off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive I could</font>

63
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,760
actually tell it then to power<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off</font>

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,190
and turn the drive off and turn it back

65
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,870
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so I don't have to be there to</font>

66
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,769
finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job then it will continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

67
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,450
from there so so and you'll see like I

68
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,860
said at the end of this it'll turn

69
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,899
around and go backwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to do</font>

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,150
a pass backwards which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change how</font>

71
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,799
the cash actually works on the device in

72
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,629
case there was a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with memory or</font>

73
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">something on the device going backwards</font>

74
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually kind of in effect disables it</font>

75
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,879
even though we can disable the cash

76
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:02,099
directly but it does do a bike

77
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,108
comparison during what's called an ECC

78
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:06,420
pass if the drive actually returns an

79
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,890
error most equipment will actually just

80
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,720
fail it will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say abort and it will</font>

81
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,250
not return a sector but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

82
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,079
request the sector back with certain

83
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,970
pieces of hardware so you can get the

84
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get the sector back let's say</font>

85
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,109
512 bytes maybe one bite was damaged you

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,060
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually request that back and it'll</font>

87
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,200
do a bit wise comparison and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

88
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,030
tell it how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,560
I can say read it 15 times compare them

90
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,609
and figure out what the most probable

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,230
answer is so quite a complex scenario

92
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,519
all right so anyway so it's done it's

93
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going backwards i have no</font>

94
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,269
errors at this point for the files that

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop</font>

96
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:47,430
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to turn the thing off then</font>

97
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,980
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the original</font>

98
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,010
destination disk again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination</font>

99
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,910
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got wrote all the data to and I'm</font>

100
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it back online</font>

101
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,019
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and you'll still</font>

102
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">see I have a deactivated MBR it's</font>

103
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,170
exactly the same state as what it was

104
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,440
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll actually have my</font>

105
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,260
file content so I'll actually cute my

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,488
image<font color="#CCCCCC"> explorer unfortunately the project</font>

107
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,488
doesn't do a whole lot at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment</font>

108
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,840
select my drive

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,659
so I'm just getting the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and</font>

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,410
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the green sectors like</font>

111
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,810
wherever I click around on on a drive so

112
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,810
we did this let's say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this porn</font>

113
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:50,570
LOL directory so there's a folder called

114
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,160
vixens and so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually um you can</font>

115
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the map and you can see</font>

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the file that I'm highlighting where all</font>

117
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,860
these blue dots are in the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

118
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,930
green so the greens are successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

119
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,730
copied this file and the blue dot means

120
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,139
they belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this file so you can</font>

121
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,000
actually have others like I can scroll

122
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,460
around anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's green I would</font>

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have a copy of so like if I'm</font>

124
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,849
scrolling down through through the drive

125
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,310
like all this space there's nothing

126
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,260
there I didn't copy any of those sectors

127
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,730
so so anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font>

128
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,289
now let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say i want this folder</font>

129
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,810
this is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has the</font>

130
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:26,090
data now on the drive so if i save these

131
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,490
files that will now save them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

132
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,440
folder and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go even while it's</font>

133
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,990
writing them to my destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

134
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,780
storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on this local machine I now</font>

135
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,890
actually have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> configuration and</font>

136
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:45,229
while it's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to go</font>

137
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so so so these actually</font>

138
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,039
came off of that destination disk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

139
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:54,950
can go look at them and thumbnails now

140
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,840
the program still actually exporting um

141
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,280
it could be anything that's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

142
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">drawers from a standpoint of media</font>

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,609
damage head damage or certain locations

144
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:05,570
of a drive that actually have physical

145
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:08,120
damage to them um this one is not that

146
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,979
bad it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very bad but if I had a</font>

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,090
very badly damaged drive I mean keep in

148
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:14,479
mind i'm trying to do it at demo here

149
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,000
dude I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to work while I'm here</font>

150
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,260
if I have a very badly damaged drive or

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like I have one on Friday that</font>

152
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,849
actually rebuilt the board and rebuilt

153
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,400
the head assembly and had to actually

154
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,200
resolder a chip on it and it still ended

155
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,359
up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,600 errors at the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

156
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,370
but I was sixteen hundred is nothing i

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,700
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know eight megs or</font>

158
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,530
something so so not much to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

159
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,419
I've exported just those folders and

160
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,619
again I did some other so we could

161
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually go back remember actually</font>

162
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,860
selected earlier say this guy in

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,770
did my documents and I did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

164
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,030
chicks folder this one is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a demo</font>

165
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:58,010
drive at the moment I didn't want to

166
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,169
show too much bad stuff so but I've done

167
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,620
many of these the same way in the last

168
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,490
30 days so but I can export the data and

169
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,490
then go look at it

170
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,100
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second most seen hard drives</font>

171
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,560
besides and like ntfs literally as like

172
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,150
ninety percent of what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> HFS is</font>

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,910
probably most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the rest of the ten</font>

174
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,549
percent and occasionally linux or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nast</font>

175
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,800
boxes are about all that's left this

176
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,170
will image all of those drives but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

177
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,270
will not do this function finding the

178
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,010
individual files yet they'd only do that

179
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,109
on ntfs that won't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on any of the</font>

180
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,390
others so but that's that's typically

181
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the majority of what I'm looking at from</font>

182
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,550
that standpoint so so anyway that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,020
just demonstrating it coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

184
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,910
drive and getting that process but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

185
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,560
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a pretty profound</font>

186
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,110
process that we're actually drilling

187
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,970
down now<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the same device same tools</font>

188
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,530
the same equipment unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

189
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to drill down specifically to</font>

190
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,309
individual files and actually get this

191
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,840
done so yeah deep spar is the vendor but

192
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,670
they also call the product deep scar

193
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,039
disk imager so they named it like

194
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">microsoft office you know same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so</font>

195
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,430
so they use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same tools the same idea</font>

196
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,320
to do everything now as a matter of fact

197
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,940
this up to Gary that came free like I've

198
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,550
owned this box for like three years now

199
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,810
this upgrade came free and they

200
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that they've done so far</font>

201
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's been upgrades with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exception</font>

202
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,289
of changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware has been free so</font>

203
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,350
if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change to the hardware</font>

204
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,030
which is only happened once and it

205
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,040
wasn't necessary you didn't have to have

206
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,900
it so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only time they've ever</font>

207
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">charged anybody anything so all the</font>

208
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:49,560
software that's on the box has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

209
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:51,090
updated for free so what's that I don't

210
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,949
know exactly what's inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it other</font>

211
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:55,850
than the fact that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just a</font>

212
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,930
flash device that also can control the

213
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:00,300
physical power itself is probably

214
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">related to the power switch and stuff as</font>

215
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,449
well I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically doing all its</font>

216
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,890
commands through the ATA command set and

217
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">then some enhanced knowledge that they</font>

218
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,130
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have with regards to individual</font>

219
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,460
vendors because one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things</font>

220
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this tool can do which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

221
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,100
tool in its price range that actually

222
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,100
does this but me

223
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,180
it doesn't matter it can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

224
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">including zip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drives and everything else</font>

225
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,750
the only problem right now is actually

226
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,189
solid state because<font color="#CCCCCC"> solid state drives</font>

227
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't conform to the standard 80 a</font>

228
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:34,650
subset yeah they're just digits

229
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bridgeport's for all of them yeah you</font>

230
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,189
need a PI license to do this especially

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:44,780
if it's on a forensics job right inside

232
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,780
joke or outside joke everyone good
