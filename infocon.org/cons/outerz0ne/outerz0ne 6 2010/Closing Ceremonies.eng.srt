for vendors or staff or speakers the

325
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,790
best way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that is</font>

326
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,240
to pony up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a speech or get on</font>

to do normally on the badges I have some

347
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,570
sort of really weird cute things which

348
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:21,830
have to match up and unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

349

attacks my brain I couldn't come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,990
anything really neat and knew that

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,100
hadn't been done or was a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

352
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:32,600
deviation from something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been</font>

353
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,490
done before by us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I yeah pretty</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">much now everyone give a group hug I'm</font>

355
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:41,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving so one year I did QR codes where</font>

356
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,340
you actually had to scan the code and it

357
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,510
had numbers embedded in the information

358
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:49,158
there we had large numbers on one side

359
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:51,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> square root on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yaks had to</font>

360
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,929
do some math well that's great people up

361
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,209
last year during traffic on which was a

362
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine-hour debacle to get from Nashville</font>

363
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:02,270
here I actually sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and wrote some</font>

364
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,740
code that did characters had all the

365
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:05,149
wingdings and things like that that you

366
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">had to match up that went down the side</font>

367
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:10,969
of it so it's fun to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

368
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:12,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's unfortunately very difficult</font>

369
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,900
to find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new and refreshing</font>

370
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,190
every time I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

371
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,950
budget to compete with<font color="#CCCCCC"> shmoo who</font>

372
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,320
actually did laser-cut metal badges one

373
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,120
year that had wave patterns yet to match

374
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,909
up which also could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as deadly</font>

375

weapons so yeah we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> restrict</font>

572
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,030
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I was going to go</font>

573
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,189
through and I'm somewhat organized<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

575
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:12,030
the entire weekend so usually what we do

576
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:14,500
is I have graphics the shirt graphics or

577
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,929
the program and have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the speakers</font>

578
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,469
sign it unfortunately I didn't get a

579
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,929
chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all that prepped and we</font>

580
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,489
auction that off and basically the

581
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:28,510
proceeds of that go to help pay for the

582
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:31,239
con it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretend to</font>

583
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,470
think that outer zone will go down in

584
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:34,928

<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely yeah they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been if</font>

625
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,310
there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

626
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,830
shown up with things did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just like</font>

627
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:53,980
attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how that works so</font>

628
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:57,799
um make a long story longer um I was

629
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:00,560
driving one day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just being epiphany</font>

630
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,500
and came up with you know 2010 the year

631
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,730
of do well I'm not artistic really when

632
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,640
you get down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it and it may be</font>

633
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:10,280
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> evident but what I ended up</font>

634
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:11,690
doing is I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

635
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,510
different stages you guys when you're

636
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,810
you

637
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,480
maker you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you design something you</font>

638
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,830
actually you know cad drawings you go

639
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,110
through and scratch something on the

640
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,640
back of a napkin scroll it on your arm

641
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,520
and blood I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you guys</font>

642
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,759
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your creative process for me</font>

643
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,210
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's drive so what I kind of</font>

644
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,920
put together was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design phase the</font>

645
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,940
actual execution and then the finished

646
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,440
product and for me that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of my</font>

647
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:42,240
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the way I go through it</font>

648
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,070
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the boxes started out as a</font>

649
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,120
sketch in the back of a piece of paper

650
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:50,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then a CAD drawing and then a lot of</font>

651
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,259
cutting and some welding and I think I

652
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,240
screwed my fingers up several times I've

653
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,440
still have a sliver of metal in my

654
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,660
finger I can't get out that's kind of

655
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:04,920
fun so MRI I'll do in a heartbeat so um

656
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:07,529
I did the original graphics what you saw

657
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,900
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website was actually cropped out</font>

658
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,070
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> my shoes the edge of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my shoes</font>

659
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,920
are actually showing in the original

660
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,990
picture was snapped it there so put the

661
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,360
graphic up and I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> this at the</font>

662
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,709
consortium one afternoon and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

663
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,660
enjoyed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and everything well I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

664
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,670
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I've got to auction</font>

665
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,370
something off normally I would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

666
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">speakers names and everything and the</font>

667
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,170
other night<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and recreated</font>

668
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,210
what's actually on the website in with

669
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,790
the original objects that were used to

670
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:37,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">take the picture and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

671
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:39,270
unfortunately when you hang a steel

672
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:42,540
ruler off the picture and then you crop

673
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:47,400
it well I had to take a hacksaw and cut

674
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:49,670
the ruler and chisel no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not no it</font>

675
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,670
isn't

676
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:57,130
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take your cane and stomp him</font>

677
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you a beer can't drink</font>

678
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:06,520
everybody you are so picky I swear I'm

679
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:10,660
not giving you a bit give me the book

680
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:14,730
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just good so what we do every year</font>

681
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,730
is we auction something off and

682
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:22,420
basically my signature board will take

683
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,670
place at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because this actually was</font>

684
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up on my wall but I wanted</font>

685
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put something out there that meant a</font>

686
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,740
lot and and there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have actually every year kind of</font>

688
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,299
clamor to get whatever our auction

689
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,470
piecewise because I'm not ever making

690
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,640
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ever again and you're</font>

691
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not going to find one in the</font>

692
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,509
thrift store so thank you very much so

693
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proceeds of the auction actually got</font>

694
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:46,200
to help pay for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> con itself I think</font>

695
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've done halfway decent this year but</font>

696
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,109
who knows it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> until we sit down and</font>

697
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,569
actually counted out and figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

698
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:57,120
much money i kept spending to get stuff

to different conferences everywhere to

864
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,339
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background to actually write the</font>

865
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">geek mafia series so it was really</font>

866
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:46,890
interesting I'm oh wow my name is in

867
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:49,730
print and it's not on the wall of the

872
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,960

873
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:02,190
it's actually the interaction went on so

874
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,420
for me it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a kick to see that</font>

875
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:08,940
because that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the start of the outer</font>

876
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,830
zone konnen sie takan phenomenon the

877
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,970
thing that we do so it was really neat

878
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:13,830
to have it in print so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

879
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:17,609
chance the geek mafia series is really

880
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:20,069
interesting rick is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy who came up</font>

881
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:23,369
with the premise and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font>

882
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:26,490
city of heroes if you read the first

883
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:27,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">book it actually has sort of what</font>

884
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:30,720
happened to him he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got out stood out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

885
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,570
his company by some jerk that works

886
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,560
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he ended up writing books for a</font>

887
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:39,990
living and enjoying life um but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

888
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,860
can tell you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first book Chloe</font>

889
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,479
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an amalgamation of different</font>

890
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,180
women he's known over the years she does

891
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,820
not exist and everyone asks if she does

892
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,129
because she if she existed there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

893
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,540
fight of every guy in as well actually

894
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,890
as a few guys one on the back that

895
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,800
probably wouldn't be fighting over but

896
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:58,690
um but we'd all be fighting over because

897
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,060
she's absolutely cool in the book so

898
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:03,730
