of the park or whatever being in here

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,468
with us troglodytes so today what am I

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,329
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about i think most of</font>

19
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,090
y'all are probably familiar with social

20
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,320
networking sites social networking

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,879
applications of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of things</font>

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,949
they're actually coming up in the

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,989
mainstream media more and more

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">frequently you're going to hear you hear</font>

25
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,830
lots and lots of stories about failures

26
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,229
information that's being disclosed on

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,658
these applications so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

28
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,720
talk specifically about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and some</font>

29
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,030
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook as well some scams out</font>

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,740
there some software vulnerabilities that

31
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,170
have been exploited<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Twitter and some</font>

32
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,030
of these other platforms some ways

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,040
people have misused these platforms for

34
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,670
command control or data exfiltration

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,320
sort of purposes and some areas that

36
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,420
would be ripe for some future research

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,860
including exporting these client

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,670
applications that some of these

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,590
platforms are using and<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploiting api's</font>

40
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,810
so social<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking right I kind of</font>

41
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,150
already introduced it how many of y'all

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,860
out there use one of these social

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:48,360
networking systems or applications or

44
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,930
sites Facebook are have a profile for

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,729
instance linkedin facebook myspace all

46
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,820
those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm yeah right so a lot of</font>

47
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,439
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to admit it okay but when</font>

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,419
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of the social networking in</font>

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,179
terms of like computer security a lot of

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,699
it it's essentially a social disease in

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,100
terms of that there's a high interaction

52
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,920
model here there's pokes there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> iams</font>

53
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">messages a lot of these platforms have</font>

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,790
ways that you can plug in web

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,100
application widgets into your profile

56
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,760
that essentially blobs of javascript and

57
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,620
flash so really one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems here</font>

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,929
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are utilizing this a lot for</font>

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,780
social engineering is this misplaced

60
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,400
perception of trust and intimacy as you

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,920
go about your interactions in these

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems and that's really one of the one</font>

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,959
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maid fails here and it's a human</font>

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,519
failure in that sense as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

65
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,520
this is lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of boundaries there's a</font>

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,260
lack of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know technical security</font>

67
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,990
boundaries and that essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these</font>

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,899
websites your browser's enforcing the

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,250
same origin policy however<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and</font>

70
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,700
Twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the Facebook in particular</font>

71
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,680
is sourcing rich web content from all

72
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,799
sorts of third-party application

73
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,390
providers so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trust and</font>

74
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,340
security boundaries are just not there

75
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">well then as I mentioned also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,240
sort of a personal or human level where

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,380
there's personal boundaries and people

78
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,570
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think through what</font>

79
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,100
they're exposing out there you know you

80
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,079
can people have been analyzing social

81
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,570
networks from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a graph</font>

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,610
theoretical perspective as well in

83
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,290
computer science there's some you know

84
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,380
core algorithms and theories about how

85
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,840
you can color a graph or divide a graph

86
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,510
or find in degrees and out degrees of

87
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,180
nodes in a graph and really these social

88
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,010
networks are essentially graphs in the

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,050
computer science sense and you can apply

90
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of these same algorithms to</font>

91
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,530
mapping social networks in terms of the

92
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,130
ants degree of separation between nodes

93
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,350
or on average how many how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

94
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,100
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you away from a malicious profile</font>

95
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,739
that's spreading exploits<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance</font>

96
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,630
um so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a good academic kind of</font>

97
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,390
paper on that is Krishna Murthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

98
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Will's they submitted a paper to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ACMs workshop on social networking 2009</font>

100
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,609
I think if you google for that you can

101
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,079
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> find their paper and they did</font>

102
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,550
some analysis of the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of personal</font>

103
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,550
information that can be found on these

104
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:14,000
websites ways you can mine it and the

105
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,640
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inferences that you can make</font>

all I'm talking about what later we'll

158
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,190
talk about the koobface worm which saw a

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of success in 2009 spreading via</font>

particularly facebook messages and the

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:33,219
propagation mechanisms of some trojan

162
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:35,409
horses such as koobface utilize<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook and these other systems to</font>

167
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,200
and so that's been a very very

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,350
implications here to URL shorteners it's

174
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,950
kind of hard to assume that the average

175
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,900
user inspects the URL before they click

176
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,060
it or even inspect the URL that the

Facebook bugs this is a one in many of a

196
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,669
series of month of bugs kind of a month

197
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,920
of vulnerabilities exercises so

198
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:11,020
anonymous security researcher by the

vulnerable facebook apps in the month of

201
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,240
sep tember it turns out it was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

202
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how he managed a responsible</font>

203
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,010
disclosure process but as far as I can

204
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,710
tell he performed responsible disclosure

205
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,570
of the 9700 vulnerable facebook

206
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,450
applications as well and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time he</font>

207
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:35,380
went public with this they had all<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

208
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:37,090
patched essentially so six of the 10

209
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,580
most popular applications and eve's were

210
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:43,030
found to<font color="#CCCCCC"> contain this nasty combination</font>

211
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> xss and a cross-site scripting and</font>

212
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,900
cross-site request forgery now when you

213
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have when you combine those two you can</font>

214
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,350
do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really fun and interesting</font>

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,170
things with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook API is and</font>

216
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,940
facebook application so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Harmony guy</font>

217
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,729
kind of dubbed this combination of two

218
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:02,350
vulnerability classes to be facts fa XX

220
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:08,290
cross-site request forgery so those

221
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,200
those popular applications that he found

222
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,780
that had this flaw had 218 million

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,520
active users per month that had these

224

226
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,010
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really consider a vulnerability</font>

227

and some little crappy Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugin</font>

228

329
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:44,240
can see Mark Zuckerberg misunderstood

his new privacy settings now he claims

<font color="#E5E5E5">someone get me a water some remind</font>

348
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:43,640
anybody so februari night 2010 google

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,830
rolled out there buzz service<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 though</font>

350
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,930
it essentially was already made 150

351
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,180
million user social network that wrote

352
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:53,060
on top of gmail and so here's a quote

353
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,810
from the official gmail blog from google

354
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that announced the introduction it's</font>

355
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,530
built right into gmail so you don't have

356
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,930
to peck out an entirely new set of

357
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,030
friends from scratch it just works if

358
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think about it there's always been a</font>

359
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,650
big social network underlying gmail buzz

360

brings this network to the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">have quite a previous efforts in this</font>

366
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,020
area they launched the or

367
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,650
good social networking service in

368
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:31,250
January 04 they released this<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenSocial</font>

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google is pretty active in the space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

373
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,110
I think they see social networking is

374
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,510
very strategic to their success and they

375
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,100
just couldn't resist this opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

376
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,930
create a hundred fifty million social

377
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,930
net user social network from scratch

378
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,430
yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that's unusual</font>

379
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">too that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not an unusual</font>

380
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,449
clause in terms of service however if

381
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,460
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a comcast or a broadband</font>

385
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,480
essentially you grant them a global non

exclusive right to redistribute any

387

395
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate that so Google Buzz was used</font>

396
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,170
to share posts and notes with people

397
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,570
that you follow it was kind of a

398
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,189
confusing system because you

399
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,450
automatically were following the people

400
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,750
that you emailed and chatted with the

401
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,070
most and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> default this list of first</font>

402
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,100
followers as in first<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree of</font>

404
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,440
profile item so essentially it exposed

405
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,400
the network of email and chat contacts

406
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,290
for individuals using gmail so not only

407
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it pretty disastrous to some</font>

408
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,690
people's privacy and security it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

409
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">was viewed as a large PR blunder by the</font>

410
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,010
media and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google they kind of</font>

411
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:24,680
miscalculated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

413
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,870
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so two days after the</font>

414
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:32,500
rollout Google deploy google rolled out

415
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:35,929
some fixes in about two days after this

416
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,040
so here's some press clippings

417
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,420
showing the kind of reaction the media

418
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,420
was having to google buzz<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

419
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,350
right so the point being made is it I

420
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,149
probably was a little bit kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Google</font>

421
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,770
and using the word default in<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality</font>

422
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:00,870
this was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of turned on there was no</font>

423
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,399
there was actually no effective way as

424
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,360
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can tell in the first two days</font>

425
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:12,719
to disable it so yeah it was voiced it

426
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:13,979
upon a lot of gmail users but ok so the

427
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">details I understand is whether you</font>

428
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept it or not your followers were</font>

429
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:27,330
exposed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail I</font>

430
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,890
don't know so here's that they rushed

431
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:32,070
out the privacy related fixes in like

432
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,840
two days flat pretty pretty impressive

433
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,158
reaction but not so impressive debut

434
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,399
right so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one change it made the</font>

435
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,590
people that you follow excuse me it made

436
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:46,529
the option to hide the people you follow

437
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:49,260
much more prominent they claim that

438
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:53,100
option existed i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure but here you</font>

439
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:58,500
know it's like in bold text right so now

440
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,580
it's more visible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok Oh certainly yeah</font>

441
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,679
you turn something on for a hundred

442
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,870
fifty million<font color="#E5E5E5"> users many of them won't</font>

443
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,610
notice what just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I'm sure</font>

444
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,139
that there's plenty of users that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

445
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,678
it wide open as it was on day one it

446
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:18,140
they added link so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could block block</font>

447
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:21,960
users in more places so before you

448
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:25,130
couldn't previously you could only block

449
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,230
users that had a public Google profile

450
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,809
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone had never created a google</font>

451
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:33,899
profile but was a gmail<font color="#CCCCCC"> user which is</font>

452
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:35,789
very common buzz turned on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys had</font>

453
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:37,709
communicated your they're following you

454
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,270
automatically now you couldn't block

455
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,250
them you cannot remove them from your

456
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,500
list of followers because they didn't

457
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,580
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public profile now so they</font>

458
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,179
introduced the ability to do that and

459
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,178
here

460
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:58,450
well like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before right so</font>

461
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:00,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of inferences and this</font>

462
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,690
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is valuable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too for lots of</font>

463
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:07,179
different purposes you know I have

464
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,580
first-hand instant responder kind of

465
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:12,489
knowledge of<font color="#CCCCCC"> incidents where attackers</font>

466
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,589
all they were after<font color="#E5E5E5"> was your PGP web of</font>

467
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:17,109
trust they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even take the secret</font>

468
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:19,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys all they wanted to know is who does</font>

469
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:22,269
this individual communicate securely

470
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:24,399
with all right so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing</font>

471
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:27,700
to go do a targeted attack just to

472
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:30,580
snatch your PGP web of trust this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

473
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,539
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty useful too and you</font>

474
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't even have to explore anything</font>

475
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:44,950
you just like harvest the profiles on

476
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:46,629
the web yeah so here and here the other

477
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,099
change they made was it now breaks out

478
00:20:46,629 --> 00:20:50,978
and makes clear like who has a public

479
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:54,519
profile and who<font color="#CCCCCC"> does it of the people</font>

480
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:57,339
that are following you so like the day

481
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:01,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">it came out no februari</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 16th like our</font>

482
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:03,489
snake on hackers org someone um a guy

483
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,049
going by the handle train wreck who is

484
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,820
supposedly the guy that like exposed all

485
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,549
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mairi Miley Cyrus's photos or</font>

486
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,369
something didn't didn't follow that one

487
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:14,710
but he emailed<font color="#E5E5E5"> our snake like hey check</font>

488
00:21:12,369 --> 00:21:16,839
out this XSS and yes sure enough there

489
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,139
was XSS in the location<font color="#E5E5E5"> services of</font>

490
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:21,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">Goethe of buzz so you could you could do</font>

491
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:23,468
some interesting things there though the

492
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:26,259
cool thing of the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes us a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

493
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:28,389
bit worse than the average XSS is that

494
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:30,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was in the court google.com domain</font>

495
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:35,408
it wasn't in Google Groups com it wasn't

496
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:38,049
in wasn't in the other Google brand

497
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,899
domain so if you can get XSS on google

498
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,739
com it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font>

499
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:47,488
excess and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> xss worked over HTTPS so</font>

500
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:51,399
really sweet get a nice google XSS there

501
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:53,499
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> right political repression you know</font>

502
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,389
we talked a little bit about you know

503
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:59,739
what's the value of this information or

504
00:21:55,389 --> 00:22:00,998
what kind of risks people are people

505
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:03,479
that supposed to when this information

506
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,479
is exposed

507
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:12,830
so during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back in June of last</font>

508
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,469
summer the Iranian elections happened

509
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,178
there's controversy over the contested

510
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:21,890
presidential election some widespread

511
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:23,570
protests took place in Iran so a lot of

512
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,370
this was some of this was being played

513
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,678
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Twitter and some of the other</font>

514
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:31,428
facial some of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> social networks</font>

515
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,220
so there was a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a battle going on</font>

516
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:37,660
between the opposition or the protesters

517
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:40,790
and forces loyal to the government

518
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,410
iranian revolutionary forces and so

519
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,260
there were sock puppet profiles being

520
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:48,530
created there is entrapment going on you

521
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:52,550
know of false profiles being used to try

522
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:56,090
to lure in folks sympathetic to the

523
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:58,639
opposition disinformation being spread

524
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,590
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course mapping of social networks</font>

525
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,590
and mapping of contents and associations

526
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,610
so here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this was generated</font>

527
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,220
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> mount ego I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is from</font>

528
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">a blog Petronas analytical and this is</font>

529
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:18,559
the this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a node this is a graph of</font>

530
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,809
Twitter communications during the

531
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,250
Iranian election protests and in the

532
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:29,120
middle that that central node is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a je</font>

533
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,340
underscore producer and it was an

534
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,050
individual or someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was claiming</font>

535
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,600
to be a producer<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Al Jazeera's</font>

536
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:38,210
english-language television network and

537
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,340
thus as the story goes this individual

538
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,580
was impersonating a producer<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Al</font>

539
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,080
Jazeera's television network and was

540
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,510
requesting and reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to all the</font>

541
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">people they could find that were</font>

542
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,679
expressing opposition sentiments and

543
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:55,220
requesting that they reach out and

544
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,660
contact them via cell phone or email so

545
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they could get their message out</font>

546
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:03,920
through al Jazeera we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

547
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,420
that was a real al Jazeera producer so

548
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,340
that diagram shows a recent recent

549
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,309
direct communications with about 20

550
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,750
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter users and then their</font>

551
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:13,750
communications out to the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> node</font>

552
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:19,590
so here's another graph of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

553
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:23,369
traffic during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protests you've got</font>

554
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:26,600
to sock puppets<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ran source 45 and I</font>

555
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:29,789
ran source that were allegedly

556
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,820
disseminating disinformation in<font color="#E5E5E5"> relation</font>

557
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:35,158
to the opposition protests and they're

558
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,869
the dominant nodes you can barely<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

559
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,210
it out you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can barely make it out but</font>

560
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:43,049
there's little teeny nodes surrounding

561
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like spokes and similar to</font>

562
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:48,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one and you see that pattern when</font>

563
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,039
you graph it because these individuals

564
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,619
were sending tweets directly to other

565
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,629
users and we're replying directly to

566
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,519
questions but weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like publishing</font>

567
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:59,549
stuff on a public timeline kind of thing

568
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:02,399
and then in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's</font>

569
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:04,230
five users that were like sort of anti

570
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,600
spammers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter trying to counter</font>

571
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,289
the information that these two nodes

572
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,289
were pushing out

573
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,869
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these individuals</font>

574
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:29,399
contacting the people that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

575
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:33,959
contacted to say hey they're fake<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah I'm</font>

576
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:38,699
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure um yeah BOTS finding bots could</font>

577
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,129
be good big the historical tax on social

578
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:45,990
networking right so the big three

579
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:48,509
facebook myspace twitter um anybody

580
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sammy my space worm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

581
00:25:48,509 --> 00:25:51,450
think i gave a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it like outer</font>

582
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:53,789
zone two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm probably like</font>

583
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,730
blast do it this is like as far as i can

584
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:59,509
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first real in the wild xss</font>

585
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:04,710
worm to spread through a web application

586
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:06,990
so Samy Kamkar was behind this and it

587
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,820
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of you know I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think he</font>

588
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,129
intended to obviously been intended to

589
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,320
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trouble but there may have been</font>

590
00:26:11,129 --> 00:26:15,449
some innocent you know kind of hacker

591
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,950
mentality oh my gosh<font color="#CCCCCC"> look what I can do</font>

592
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,600
I want a million friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

593
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:22,019
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a million friends over one</font>

594
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,639
evening so the author created this xss

595
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,740
script he updated his profile with it

596
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:27,869
when you view this profile it would

597
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,330
export your profile make you his friend

598
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:33,809
you post a message saying like he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

599
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:36,389
hero and then you then you send messages

600
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:38,039
to all your contacts 20 hours more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

601
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:40,949
a million users fastest spreading

602
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,740
computer virus in history at the time

603
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:47,190
and then my space suit him in civil

604
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,389
court I<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe you know he got in some</font>

605
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,399
trouble but as far as I can tell he's

606
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:52,350
sort of like a legit security researcher

607
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,539
these days he goes to conferences he's

608
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,158
doing some interesting work good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">good graph but you know you can see the</font>

612
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:09,748
hockey puck or the hockey stick kind of

613
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:13,409
thing this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own blog he was</font>

614
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:15,419
like live blogging his exploit and he

615
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:18,480
posted this picture his screenshot from

616
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:24,690
his profile and he's like look kick-ass

617
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:27,960
I rule I got a million friends uh she

618
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:29,100
wants me that says they're mad photoshop

619
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,230
skills

620
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,610
yeah well it was pretty clear like after

621
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,169
the post instant forensics would have

622
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,510
shown like his was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first profile he</font>

623
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,429
posted this payload and then it took off

624
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,840
from there so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if he</font>

625
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,940
was like silent like it they could have

626
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,939
traced it to patient zero I believe I

627
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,520
mean even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he doesn't yeah I mean if</font>

628
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:58,049
he didn't do the friend payload if he

629
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:02,490
just trash people's profiles them so

630
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:07,408

the fat client applications like they're

637
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,299

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:16,559
authentication to the HTTPS virtual host

685
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:20,790

733
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,939
Twitter API to determine when you visit

734
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:28,439
the website what your twitter if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

there it's super simple you just like

00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:37,139
call Twitter it basically utilizes like

739

the credentials that are cashing your

740
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:42,269

741
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:46,139
username in alert box that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proof</font>

742
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:48,690
of concept there so any website you

743
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:49,769
visited if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that same browser and</font>

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,870
you didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> use private browsing</font>

00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,980
mode or whatever as mitigations they

746
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,350
could as soon as you visit they'd be

about the Sammy Sammy my space worm

855
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:11,850
April 09 like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> less than a year</font>

856
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago stalked daily which was a competitor</font>

857
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:18,690
to Twitter a worm hit Twitter spreading

858
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:20,620
a message about joining<font color="#CCCCCC"> stalked daily</font>

859
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,690
and the link will take you to a

860
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:26,130
cross-site scripting attack payload that

861
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">was exporting excess session the Twitter</font>

862
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,510
website it caused the profiles to send

863
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:36,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the similar message out to their</font>

864
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:40,240
contacts and here's like a screenshot of

865
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:42,520
a bunch of people's tweets that their

866
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,250
profile had been pwned by this worm and

867
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">they were propagating the payload to</font>

868
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,500
others and here's the actual attack

869
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,569
payload like it went through many

870
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,180
variations so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> every time Twitter</font>

871
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:56,830
would fix the xss who is using he'd like

872
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,180
evade their filter like five minutes

873
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,680
later and then they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix something</font>

874
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,629
else and then he'd say screw it i'm

875
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,460
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> use another parameter ha and then</font>

876
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,110
they'd fix though is she<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we got</font>

877
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,090
XSS and this other parameter they add a

878
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:11,980
filter he'd evade that filter so his cat

879
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:14,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and mouse for like a day there so he's</font>

880
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:19,930
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing little Ajax payload</font>

881
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:22,690
with a cross-site scripting here's he he

882
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,520
he confessed to what he was up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mikey</font>

883
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,400
and so he put a message on the stock

884
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,950
daily website that he had he<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have came</font>

885
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,200
clean and have accepted the

886
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,759
responsibility for the worm read the

887
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:39,609
interview here and he was interviewed

888
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,110
with some news website hello you might

889
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,640
not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click you might have learned</font>

890
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:47,680
by now don't click links from mikey and

891
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,870
here's the post on Twitter's website

892
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,910
about what was going on they called it

893
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:57,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stall daily.com worm they said</font>

894
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,359
reassured no passwords phone numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

895
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,310
other sensitive information were

896
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,270
compromised as part of this attack we

897
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:05,770
only share that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

898
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:08,380
partners cleaning up Mikey so if someone

899
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,940
launched another worm that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font>

900
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,760
removing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> militares payloads and</font>

901
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,380
fixing the profiles and so here's the

902
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,890
cleaning up<font color="#CCCCCC"> mikey worm that was launched</font>

903
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:19,960
and and so what it would do it also had

904
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,870
a little messaging payload to spread

905
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,520
itself but it said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hire Mikey so</font>

906
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,790
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> was looking out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for him you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

907
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,900
he he'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more productive in on staff</font>

908
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,579
at Twitter than in jail probably

909
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,029
and here's a picture of the perp right

910

<font color="#E5E5E5">cubeface before the koobface worm is a</font>

914
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:54,618
really prevalent piece of malware it's

915
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:56,910
been spreading for like a year or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

916
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,010
here's just some pictures of like tweets

917
00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:00,808
that the worm sends out when it when it

918
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,890
pounds you it'll grab your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

919

923
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:18,059
Twitter that's just clearly not really

926
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,788
to a website that looks like a YouTube

927
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,740
or Facebook and it will say oh you need

928
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:31,230
the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of flash to play the</font>

929
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,848
video or you need this multi media codec

930
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,390
I think codex we're a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

flash was 09 and now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mau on you if the exploits don't work</font>

935
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,109
then it will pop up a scary message and

936
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:52,170
try to social engineering Twitter

937
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:55,710
internal documents right uh or exposed

938
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:59,099

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:01,650
on Twitter I'm sorry Twitter so the

940
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,089
founders account got compromised and

941

942
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:07,740
domains or something like that and so

943
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,779
this guy who goes by hacker Kroll sit

944
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,270
like 300 dots to a bunch of media

945
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:14,760
outlets and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone was lame</font>

946
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:17,460

949
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,150
some of it was interesting stuff it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

950
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,690
like partner agreements right like who

954
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:41,670
financial projections right and there

955
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,859
was a controversy one of the TechCrunch

956
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,749
TechCrunch actually published

957
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,430
a batch of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> documents in Kwazii</font>

958
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:49,439
redacted form and there is this whole

959
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:53,220
like is that responsible journalism

960

963
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,779
so there's all sorts likes whole

964
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:08,400
ecosystem of websites<font color="#CCCCCC"> that integrate</font>

965
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:10,109
with Twitter like you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

971
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,039
awesome but they all were full of

972
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:23,220
cross-site scripting and sequel

973
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:24,839
injection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF but the surprising</font>

974
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,399
thing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole exercise is a lot</font>

or to close the account<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

1020
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:25,690
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> them your password again so it's</font>

1021
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">like if you would like to close or opt</font>

1022
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,780
out please enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> your username and</font>

1023
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you signed up with if you</font>

1024
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,920
don't remember your information it's the

1025
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:37,240
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as your Twitter information and</font>

1026
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,710
then they have so it total scam right

1027
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,209
and what happens like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't really</font>

1028
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,060
get lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of followers but you send out</font>

1029
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,710
lots of messages when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you join and all</font>

1030
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,150
the messages are saying like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

1031
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,740
found the best way to get tons of

1032
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:54,460
followers for free<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok didn't quite work</font>

1033
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:58,240
out Twitter porn name this is another

1034
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:01,510
social engineering scam and it was i'm

1035
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">not sure like who started it but it was</font>

1036
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,480
a great way to get people to reveal like

1037
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,210
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like security questions and</font>

1038
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,880
stuff so they were like hey everybody

1039
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:11,950
tweets your<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter porn name it's the</font>

1040
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,870
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your first pet and the name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1041
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,450
the street you grew up on or perhaps the

1042
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,650
name of the head teacher in your school

1043
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,390
so there's definitely a union there

1044
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,060
between like you know the authentication

1045
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,200
questions that you use with financial

1046
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,259
institutions and things of that nature

1047
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,640
or to reset passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1048
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,260
this was actually just malicious or just

1049
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:36,670
plain stupid so here's like the tweet

1050
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:38,620
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter porn name right you</font>

1051
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see Dave lamb his porn name is</font>

1052
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:45,430
Pimm's Dave and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay though because</font>

1053
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:49,440
why it saves any personal info being

1054
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:54,600
given away I don't know what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

1055
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:58,030
cool that the Russia Georgia war I guess

1056
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:01,089
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it August last summer oh yeah I</font>

1057
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess that's when it was so there's a</font>

1058
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:04,900
denial of service attack excuse me

1059
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:07,360
shooting is that the war was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> august</font>

1060
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:09,040
last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't recall the date of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1061
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,780
war but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1062
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,740
attack that took<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter offline on</font>

1063
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:16,360
august sixth 2009 and it was related to

1064
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:19,540
the conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian Federation</font>

1065
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,930
in the Republic of Georgia so there was

1066
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:26,320
a profile on Twitter called<font color="#E5E5E5"> c YX y mu</font>

1067
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:29,710
that was sending out<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> georgian sort</font>

1068
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,240
of georgian nationalist tweets and some

1069
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,970
hacktivists sympathetic to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> russian</font>

1070
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:37,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">federation in there cause didn't like</font>

1071
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,859
that and decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> silence this one</font>

1072
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter profile they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

1073
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,230
dost Twitter and they took Twitter down

1074
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,030
for part of the day and I was never able

1075
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,290
to get details of how the dots<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

1076
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,080
it just like a brute force<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1077
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,860
bandwidth<font color="#CCCCCC"> da so did they find something</font>

1078
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:54,759
interesting to do to Twitter's

1079
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,880
infrastructure to cause it happen and a

1080
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,270
court this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written up by Brian Krebs</font>

1081
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:05,740
formerly of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Washington Post we're</font>

1082
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:07,420
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to got about 15 minutes left we'll</font>

1083
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into like how you can actually you</font>

1084
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,680
know like subvert some Twitter

1085
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:13,960
authentication stuff here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter the</font>

1086
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,089
legacy authentication mechanism is HTTP

1087
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,880
basic auth which is essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

1088
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:20,740
base64 of the credential user name colon

1089
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,360
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> that soon as HTTP header</font>

1090
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,759
essentially the simplest way to

1091
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,790
authenticate using the HTTP protocol and

1092
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,500
it completely relies upon something at a

1093
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,870
lower level and protocol stack provide

1094
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:37,030
for confidentiality and integrity like

1095
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:38,529
ssl/tls typically and so the the the way

1096
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,230
they promote authenticating is oooff

1097
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:43,830
which is sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket it's not</font>

1098
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:47,050
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Kerberos but it's sort of a</font>

1099
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:48,790
ticket based authentication mechanism

1100
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,100
where you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to provide your</font>

1101
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:54,940
twitter username and password to the

1102
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:57,700
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> party site instead they request a</font>

1103
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,810
ticket on your behalf from<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter so it</font>

1104
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,439
like sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a view familiar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1105
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:04,029
how Kerberos works so and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font>

1106
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">party client apps or sites that want to</font>

1107
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,380
use OAuth have to register with Twitter

1108
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,210
which is a step<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't need if</font>

1109
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,400
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write a client out just</font>

1110
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,800
using basic off but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll write one in</font>

1111
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten lines of Python right but to use</font>

1112
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,550
OAuth you need like an OAuth

1113
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:21,230
authentication account that's been

1114
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:23,119
reviewed by Twitter

1115
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:25,790
but it's a huge challenge for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1116
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,240
disable basic off there's there's like

1117
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:30,859
10,000 client apps or excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1118
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,810
tens there's thousands of client apps

1119
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:37,190
out there so it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user base</font>

1120
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:38,990
problem right so one thing needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1121
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,460
happen is more more pressure needs to be

1122
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,229
put on these sites i guess in the app

1123
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,850
developers to fix this and move 20 off

1124
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:48,680
as you can see how this fails so the

1125
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,930
coolest fail of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic off stuff was</font>

1126
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,419
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if you followed November</font>

1127
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:56,000
the disclosure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ssl renegotiation</font>

1128
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,240
gap this is a vulnerability from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ray</font>

1129
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">despensa or marsh ray and Steve dispensa</font>

1130
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:06,020
of phone factor and they responsibly

1131
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:10,190
disclosed this it's a essentially way to

1132
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:13,880
do ssl renegotiation to it to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1133
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:17,119
post a request as a man-in-the-middle

1136
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a name handy security goose i think</font>

1137
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,990
is attainable he published is really

1138
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:30,799
cool proof of concept that actually used

1139
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:32,450
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter's HB service supported new</font>

1141
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:37,609
yet so he used<font color="#CCCCCC"> that celery negotiation</font>

1142
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:41,180
to compromise people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

1143
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:47,000
credentials over when they were sent

00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:50,629
over HTTPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was pretty cool but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh off</font>

1145
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,270
is not perfect either you know it's it's

1146
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:56,630
the permissions are just read or read

1147
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:58,970
right so and so either you grant the

1148
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,350
website the third party website or

1149
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:01,879
application the ability to read your

1153
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,410
are going to require<font color="#E5E5E5"> right permissions</font>

1154
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:16,368
to like offer the cool value that they

1173
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:58,100
just like kidnap that token and use that

00:51:52,130 --> 00:52:00,110
somehow a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter botnet commanding</font>

project out there and you can delete

1177

control botnets via Twitter tweets or

it edit last summer at Def Con 17 they

1218
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:58,200
was like posting tweets that were base

1219
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,870
64 encoded URLs and the URLs led to a

blob of text which was pkzip archives

1221
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:04,740

or oh yeah so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1229
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:29,820
Twitter website off got like eight nine

1232
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:38,730
will load it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no HP redirect</font>

1233
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:42,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">and https redirect in place so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1234
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:45,870
the form right it uses the HPS URL to

1235
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:48,690
form submit it does include this

1236
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:51,509
authenticity token which is a randomly

1237
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:55,290
generated nonce as in a mitigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CSRF and that comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down as part of the</font>

00:54:55,290 --> 00:55:04,020
form when it loads the login page but if

1240
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,410
you understand like<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF sand exercises</font>

1241
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:09,390
you know if you can find an XSS a good

1242
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:11,430
exercise in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application then this</font>

1243
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,529
not sand this token isn't really it

1244
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,509
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent you from like doing</font>

1245
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:19,790
anything because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already you can</font>

1246
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,790
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> it via the Dom I think</font>

1247
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:33,790
it's not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you can code</font>

1248
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,649
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right i don't think it's</font>

1249
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:37,630
maybe there's two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do it the</font>

1250
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,550
the obvious reason is this is the way

1251
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,460
you're supposed to mitigate against<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF</font>

1252
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,380
the not so obvious reason is hey we want

1253
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,510
a walled garden right and we don't want

1254
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:48,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">BOTS running them up on our service and</font>

1255
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,600
harvesting information but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1256
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:52,090
really true because they offer all these

1257
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,069
api's and they make deals with Google

1258
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:57,250
and Bing to index everything and make it

1259
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:59,890
available as real-time indexes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

1260
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just use the API right but this is</font>

1261
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:05,650
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there to protect against</font>

1262
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:06,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSRF and they have some hidden form</font>

1263
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:10,180
fields and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how they're</font>

1264
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:12,460
really used yet whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like oh you</font>

1265
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,680
haven't liked it<font color="#CCCCCC"> sends a random form</font>

tested it or sign in underscore<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q and</font>

1268
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,900
maybe if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't submit that bat it's</font>

1269
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,940

ever hopefully when you log out and

1285
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:12,250
validates the cookie somehow in the back

1286

00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,279
we'll put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a firewall rule to send</font>

1298
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:43,960
a reset back

1299
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,240
the twitter has one IP they don't do

1300
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,070
they don't do complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS any</font>

1301
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,439
casting or whatever you resolve twitter

1302
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:53,560
com you get IP address back put a farmer

1303
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,420
rule in there for a reset 4443 des port

1304
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,860
when someone uses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter</font>

1305
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,410
application and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter apps</font>

1306
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,000
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this it attempts ssl it</font>

1307
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,109
gets the reset back and it happily just

1308
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,150
sends the credentials in clear text

1309
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:06,310
there's no visible indication to the

1310
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,570
user whatsoever unless you're sniffing

1311
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,980
the wire you would not know that your

1317
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:26,260
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of problems there you can</font>

1318
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:27,730
attack these apps like you uh you can

1319
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:30,310
attack these apps<font color="#CCCCCC"> there expose a big</font>

1320
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:32,980
attack surface I've set up a peach

1321
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,680
fuzzer as a rogue Twitter service like

1322
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,620
us it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuzz's the clients and so</font>

1323
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,049
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can fuzz Jason RSS Adam</font>

1324
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:43,540
XML parser<font color="#E5E5E5"> inners all that stuff is</font>

1325
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,280
exposed in these client applications so

1326
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,960
it was a pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ass to get peach to</font>

1327
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,220
actually fuzz client applications but it

1328
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,570
can be done or you could do some

1329
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting evil man in the middle</font>
