48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,040
sit in the audience at a TED talk

49
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,320
they're supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nashville</font>

50
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,390

51
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you had to pay some outrageous</font>

52
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,530
fee to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to live stream the stuff</font>

53
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,440
off the web to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

54
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,690
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> time honestly I can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that while I</font>

55
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,310
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and watch the stuff after it's been</font>

56
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">post processed and all the neat things</font>

57
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,690
have been put in it so why am I going to

58
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,490
spend that money I really like the idea

59
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,680
of the TED talks some of them are two

60
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,760
minutes long some of them are 15 to 20

61
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,970
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter is so</font>

62
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,860
as how most things actually take place I

63
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,390
was bored one day for a good 30 seconds

64
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,330
or so and I thought you know what would

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">be really cool to do did I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just say that</font>

66
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,930
geez what would be really cool would be

67
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,490
to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like ted talks but then</font>

68
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">i thought i really don't want to start</font>

69
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,890
another conference well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do I</font>

70
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:12,110
don't know so I thought let's do Bob we

71
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:17,210
had inner zone now there's outer zone

72
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:20,650
there's Ted now there's Bob so they said

73
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,650
that kick his ass

74
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:30,120
d actually make a good point but anyway

75
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,640
we called<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Bob talks um someone</font>

76
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,110
actually suggested breaker build which

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,490
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a take office and the stuff</font>

78
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,480
that schmuck on does<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a different</font>

79
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,980
track so i really like the the idea of

80
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the short staccato those things because</font>

81
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,530
some people won't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

82
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,570
with 45 to 50 minutes worth of material

83
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,000
for their their talk and would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

84
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,700
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something short sweet to the point it</font>

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,530
is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> where start to finish</font>

86
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,180
you explain everything have this big

87
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">long drawn out conversation with</font>

88
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,750
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the crowd it's a hey here's</font>

89
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,370
what my idea is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a general thing</font>

90
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,020
catch me later buy me a drink and I'll

91
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,650
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest will collaborate on it</font>

92
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:14,729
so it's kind of the general idea behind

93
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:17,520
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to take a little bit of</font>

94
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,840
crap because the website wasn't updated

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:26,219
as much as it needed to be if at all but

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,229
hey listen man you're a tough crowd um I

97
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,729
didn't get to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I</font>

98
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:31,289
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to this year in the time</font>

99
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,550
they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to him so next year</font>

100
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,630
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a web sorry I think</font>

101
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,800
I've actually found somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's going</font>

102
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:38,100
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care of a lot of the web stuff</font>

103
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,020
for me so that it takes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the load</font>

104
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,760
off main because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a web guy I'm</font>

105
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,609
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I build infrastructure and</font>

106
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,320
things like that I make a really really

107
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,290
directed to the point website with no

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:55,800
flashy graphics so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to thank</font>

109
00:07:49,290 --> 00:08:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything my image folder has like nine</font>

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,210
images in it two of them are me so I

111
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,460
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say thank you to all of the</font>

112
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who first of all actually</font>

113
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">volunteered to do a talk here second of</font>

114
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,510
all the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> volunteer to do a</font>

115
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,400
bob talk there it only listed two of

116
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,250
them on the page I had several<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

117
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,890
come up and offer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do them we had</font>

several<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who were slated to do it</font>

119
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:25,349

175
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:04,439
categorize us the media which most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

176
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,459
them are assholes yeah hiss boo

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,649
ourselves if you've ever been<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

178
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,649
shmoocon some of the other cons they'll

179
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,569
be either panel talks or there'll be

180
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,000
guys standing around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're arguing</font>

181
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:17,560
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what we call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other your</font>

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,079
white hat you're a black hat your<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

183
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,459
hat which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anyone ever uses</font>

184
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,310
those way back in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was you're</font>

185
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,170
a hacker you're a cracker nowadays I

186
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,388
think we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers and criminals</font>

187
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:34,560
so take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your pick which one you are I</font>

188
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:38,440
think terrorists yeah you remember

189
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,630
maverick went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bna nationals airport</font>

190
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,149
and one year at<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaknik our t-shirts</font>

191
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,560
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a hacker not a terrorist and it</font>

192
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:46,420
was right after nine eleven so he was

193
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,189
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> around through the airport to</font>

194
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,569
pick someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> up hold his hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

195
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,220
logo because he was afraid that they

196
00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:53,380
were going to tackle<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in for him to</font>

197
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ground and actually probably have</font>

198
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:01,269
been a good idea to do that to maverick

199
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:03,100
but what can you say um so we have a

200
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,810
hard time actually kind of categorizing

201
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:11,410
ourselves and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that one or</font>

202
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:15,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">two or even three tags actually</font>

203
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,040
categorize who we are and what we do I

204
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:26,260
know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of words used to</font>

205
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:29,290
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did oh you are me so who</font>

206
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">knows who Ashley Schwartz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alia is a few</font>

207
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,790
of us she put a DVD out she did a

208
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:38,110
documentary where she went to to work on

209
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:41,110
and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON i believe and got</font>

210
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,209
a lot of video and hers was a DVD called

211
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,439
hackers are people too and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

212
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,449
of funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot of the guys that</font>

213
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">I run around with the DEFCON shmoo work</font>

214
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:50,500
you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of informal</font>

215
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,970
interviews and and someone said it best

216
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,110
I think it was actually annoyed that

217
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,850
said

218
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,279
you know we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everyone else</font>

219
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,800
you know we're not dark shadowy

220
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,209
characters you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in a basement locked</font>

know we do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> laundry we my our yards</font>

223
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,850
we have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so we're just</font>

224
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,199
kind of standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> people we just look at</font>

225
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,670
things a lot differently than the rest

226
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the world does so I I'm the president</font>

227
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,010
of the hacker consortium which is our

233
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,019
programmer I do it when I've got a gun

234
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:42,579
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head and I have to do it I'm huh</font>

235
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:44,709
well actually I never mind um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

236
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,269
don't code unless I have to if it's

237
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,219
something where I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

238
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,019
way to get data from here to there and

239
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,990
it requires me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a book and figure</font>

240
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,269
it out so that's not really my gig now

241
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,769
air that in the back arafat programs and

242
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,269
Ruby like nobody's business I've never

243
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,589
seen someone flipped between screen

244
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:04,899
sessions as quickly and as efficiently

245
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:06,730
as he does that's his gig he's one of

246
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">our resident programmers wrench is</font>

247
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,180
another one so we all kind of have our

248
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,120
own strengths<font color="#E5E5E5"> and weaknesses I'm a</font>

249
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,739
physical materials kind of guy i weld a

250
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,750
lot of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see floating</font>

251
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,660
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boxes that you see up here</font>

252
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,640
that have the projector on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I custom</font>

253
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,380
built all those myself painted them the

254
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,029
whole nine yards welded up the base for

255
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">it yeah no no it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just something to do</font>

256
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:33,790
i guess to waste a lot of time but um we

257
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,410
kind of have our own specialties<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

258
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be considered a maker and a</font>

259
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:41,260
hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some sort i have other</font>

260
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:43,449
projects start work on every one of our

261
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,189
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides here now has vanderbilt</font>

262
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,540
university's logo in the bat grounded

263
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,620
until they programmed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

264
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,939
projector so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

265
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">university in the south and i'm not</font>

266
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sure which one it is</font>

267
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:01,170
can't really tell you so if the

268
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,060
consortium we have a lot of

269
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,229
collaboration someone comes in is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

270
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,869
man i really wanna learn how to weld

271
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,220
well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i fire up the welder we</font>

272
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:10,260
figure out how to really screw up a

273
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,550
piece of metal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and say you</font>

274
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,990
know hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't understand what the</font>

275
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:15,449
hell is going on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this can someone</font>

276
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,920
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code so it's really nice to</font>

277
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,830
be able to collaborate in that way

278
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,300
because honestly if it wasn't for that

279
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,980
all you could do is google and look at a

280
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,380
book it take a lot longer to get things

281
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,430
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of a visual guy point to</font>

282
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,270
it tell me what I'm doing so we kind of

283
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:35,099
see things a little bit differently um I

284
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:38,910
have a project that I'm working on where

285
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,550
I am intercepting data at a large

286
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,060
southern university that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in on</font>

287
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:48,380
us na on a single subnet and then I cut

288
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">down that data and I'm looking for any</font>

289
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,380
probes anything it's a TCP connection

290
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:57,959
from Russia Iraq China and Romania and

291
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,660
oddly enough from those four countries i

292
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,440
get about<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty thousand hits where</font>

293
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,920
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to make a connection</font>

294
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,960
there the only trouble is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30,000</font>

295
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,270
bits of data it's really hard to

296
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,400
visualize what's going on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

297
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:13,710
collected the data and discovered a lot

298
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,000
of patterns my problem now is I got to

299
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,640
find someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can help me actually</font>

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,950
visualize that search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for patterns</font>

301
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,600
things of that nature and since I can't

302
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,100
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Al Stroger to save my life</font>

303
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't say hey would you write</font>

304
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,430

305
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,130
something neat so he's a little bit out

306
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:33,239
of pocket um we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kind of see things</font>

307
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,590
differently like I say I'm a materials

308
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,810
kind of guy when you say hey I want to

don't specifically search for a name to

340

if that are wonderful but it's also

367
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,639
important that we we spend some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

ladies and gentlemen<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you for</font>

421
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:43,030
coming out I hope you enjoy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of</font>

422
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:45,100
the con so my entire can be summed

423
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,330
up in two network diagram slides so I'm

424
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,689
just going to kind of tell you the story

425
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,879
of how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of came into existence as</font>

426
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,590
soon as I get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up just to kind</font>

427
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,090
of add my two cents of escada<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

428
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,740
saying we need people ask you what you

429
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,179
do or you know what your interests are

430
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,650
do you tell them you're a hacker or do

431
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,050
you cop out and tell them you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

432
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:04,120
information security specialist I do

433
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:11,980
network security so who calls themselves

434
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:15,550
a hacker and network security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I was</font>

435
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,890
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious I for one think that it's</font>

436
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,750
important that we're proud of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font>

437
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,790
hacker even though it's misconstrued in

438
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,860
so many different ways I'm a hacker and

439
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm proud to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a hacker that's why you</font>

440
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,280
guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

441
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:45,790
yeah I'm not gonna recover thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

442
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so i did my my slides and ms paint</font>

443
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,240
on the plane

444
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,459
oh you can see that can bring the lights

445
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:07,299
down a little bit maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right is</font>

446
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:13,750
that better just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit maybe no</font>

447
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:17,260
oh well you know project<font color="#E5E5E5"> floodgate with</font>

448
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:19,419
badass slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> I originally wanted a way</font>

449
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,960
that I could take my<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop or any</font>

450
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:24,700
computer any embedded device<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone</font>

451
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,620
my Dreamcast anything that can connect

452
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,690
to my network and i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send all of</font>

453
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,399
this data through tor regardless of

454
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it has internal proxy settings</font>

455
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,549
that allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this or even has</font>

456
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:35,260
proxy settings that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can trust you</font>

457
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,580
don't know if the device or the

458
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,399
operating system is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send phone</font>

459
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,980
home calls or update request via outside

460
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:43,989
your proxy settings so initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

461
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,710
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send all data from any device</font>

462
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:51,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was network accessible to tour and</font>

463
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,260
become as anonymous as tour gets so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

464
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,570
I said I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of work through</font>

465
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:00,669
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of how it expanded is in it</font>

466
00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:03,460
as to what it is now so basic idea was

467
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,470
will take a device and just set your own

468
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP address you're on the subnet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

469
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1689 for dot whatever non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP list</font>

470
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:14,020
you just customize it yourself and when

471
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">the router gets that data it's just</font>

472
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,010
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass it on to another box on</font>

473
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:20,889
the network called the floodgate box

474
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">well flood gate does right now is it</font>

475
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,730
takes all incoming connections and it

476
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,820
uses IP tables to divvy up the TCP

477
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,799
streams over multiple tour instances so

478
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">floodgate can run anywhere between 1 and</font>

479
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:34,299
100 for instances depending on the

480
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,220
hardware limitations you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we found</font>

481
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:37,658
that about 50 was a good was a good

482
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:42,460
limit based on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes that are</font>

483
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:46,539
in the Tor network which is about 1753

484
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,919
somewhere in that range so I mean it was

485
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,360
interesting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't send all data</font>

486
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,010
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> through multiple tour</font>

487
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,979
instances you're not going to see an

488
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,970
increase in overall speed where you're

489
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,590
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of have a</font>

490
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,500
thicker pipe that you could do more

491
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,629
devices on as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all devices on</font>

492
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,669
the network on that subnet being routed

493
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:06,460
through what single tour instance it

494
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,309
gets a load balanced over<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple tour</font>

495
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,620
instances

496
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:11,509
so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit nicer to not have</font>

497
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,340
to waste your bandwidth with other

498
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:19,789
clients on the network so that basically

499
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,320
is what it comes down to like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

500
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:25,580
can pretty much just be summed up as

501
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,070
this what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> then thought about is what</font>

502
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,649
what bit of software uses a bunch of

503
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,809
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP streams that don't have</font>

504
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:37,248
anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Victorian</font>

505
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,499
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't hit BitTorrent and no I don't</font>

506
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">hate poor I just think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful to</font>

507
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:45,470
marry them together so what we entered

508
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:47,959
were doing with something like this this

509
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,480
works in very interesting ways because

510
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP streams that get routed over</font>

511
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,629
each of the tour nodes randomly right

512
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,149
now by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few tape iptables we're going</font>

513
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:57,969
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> weighted load balancing later just as</font>

514
00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:02,479
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is what it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

515
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,980
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how bittorrent works you know</font>

516
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP streams go out give divvied up</font>

517
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,879
to each of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tour networks and the</font>

518
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">tour exit nodes all have different IP</font>

519
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:12,740
addresses so all the exit nodes join the

520
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,389
same swarm and the swarm now thinks that

521
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,330
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of seeing one new client it has</font>

522
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:19,340
50 new clients 50 peers so instead of

523
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,769
allocating bandwidth and resources to

524
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,408
send bits of data to a single client

525
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,110
it's now sending data to 50 clients

526
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:29,149
which all in the end route back to your

527
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,610
client so<font color="#E5E5E5"> theoretically you could get</font>

528
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:33,559
faster speeds over<font color="#CCCCCC"> floodgate then you</font>

529
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,379
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a single BitTorrent connection</font>

530
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:38,119
on a regular internet connection in our

531
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:43,309
test case we were downloading in a boom

532
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:45,379
to ISO at 2.4 megabytes per second which

533
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:48,490
was kind of approaching the speed limit

534
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:51,889
of my internet connection just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as is and</font>

535
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,419
through flood gate we used 50 tour nodes

536
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:56,178
and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

537
00:26:53,419 --> 00:27:00,230
1.4 for 8 megabytes per second download

538
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:02,090
completely over<font color="#CCCCCC"> tour yes this is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

539
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,039
shitty to do to tour and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit torrent</font>

540
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,990
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't hate them I just</font>

541
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's an interesting idea and I'd</font>

542
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,570
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see where this could evolve and</font>

543
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:15,230
maybe change yeah what's cool about that

544
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,119
is I think BitTorrent already can tell

545
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,630
when it gets redundant data and just

546
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,730
discard

547
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:21,860
before it brings it back in also what

548
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,620
we're doing what's its kind of doing is

549
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not broadcasting the same packets</font>

550
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:30,530
or so I'm just going to rambling right

551
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:32,030
now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have a</font>

552
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:34,280
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with duplicate data as is</font>

553
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,129
because the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> load balancing works</font>

554
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,139
is it takes incoming tcp connection

555
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,840
streams to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> floodgate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IP tables</font>

556
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,820
and it just randomly chooses a tour node

557
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,740
to send that TCP stream to so it's not

558
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,090
breaking apart the stream it's still

559
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,830
having it to the handshake and the

560
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of data so in bittorrent</font>

561
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,600
tells the swarm hey I want data it just

562
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:56,030
doesn't go over the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address it</font>

563
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes through excuse me goes through its</font>

564
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,580
its own kind of tour instance

565
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh because there's because I think like</font>

566
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,039
I said I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tour expert I'm not a</font>

567
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,299
bit for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an expert this is kind of a</font>

568
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,600
half-assed harebrained idea we threw

569
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:22,570
together like i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said i'm pretty sure</font>

570
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,870
bittorrent<font color="#CCCCCC"> will just discard duplicator</font>

571
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:28,520
as well as I don't think it's a big of

572
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,620
an issue and I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really relate why</font>

573
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,289
but you come find me afterwards and we

574
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,928
can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that just because I'm not</font>

575
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:44,950
good at talking in front of people sorry

576
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:48,679
guys I have my water that's good water

577
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,150
no tour will only do tcp/ip streams and

578
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,820
what it does actually is it even strips

579
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:54,650
of waste a lot of the IP headers and

580
00:28:52,820 --> 00:29:00,799
just maintains a lot of the core data

581
00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:04,240
that's in the TCP stream run of thing I

582
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,240
can't hear you speak up

583
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,680
the question was can the will this allow

584
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,169
us to make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one connection to</font>

585
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,060
the same cedar yes because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way</font>

586
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:19,660
bitch horn allocates resources in the

587
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:22,840
swarm inherently it's going to see each

588
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:25,300
exit node as its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients we has done</font>

589
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">pier so like I said theoretically we</font>

590
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,680
could surpass the download limitations

591
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,580
that you get from only connecting from a

592
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:35,770
single client to the swarm using 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> exit</font>

593
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,090
nodes and this is 50 BitTorrent friendly

594
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,760
exit nodes which is a different story

595
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:44,139
entirely because they do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bt filtering</font>

596
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,270
on ports by default the swarm now sees

597
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,340
multiple clients which it thinks are

598
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,139
individual clients in themselves but in

599
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,209

617
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,990
explicitly but I mean when you really

618
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,970
think about it there has to be something

619
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,980
out there that I mean come on Microsoft

620
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,240
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> chrissake there's going to be</font>

621
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,100
something out there any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of embedded</font>

622
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,960
devices because I have those embedded HD

gaming devices that you plug in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

624
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,110
pretty sure you can't do proxy settings

625
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,850
so you wanted to reverse engineer that

626
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,889
but you didn't want to have it hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now nothing specifically came up like I</font>

630
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:32,100
said kind of like yeah I didn't find

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea i had and it kind of manifested</font>

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,659
itself into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting project</font>

635
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:41,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said the source code is available</font>

636
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,000
at DC nine for nine at org slash

637
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,360
projects / floodgate if your interest

638
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,530
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in bash right now yeah the</font>

639
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,229
whole thing runs in bash it just

640
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,389
basically sets up I p tables the IP

641
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,220
tables and it starts and stops it tore

642
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:00,590
instances does all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the all the routing</font>

643
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,120
stuff yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them on the website</font>

644
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:06,120
future improvements are going to be to

645
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,469
do weighted load balancing just because

646
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,120
right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just randomly choosing a</font>

647
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,440
tour connection so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

648
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,428
which porch catchers are being used to

649
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:17,309
well as well as we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to glean</font>

650
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:20,130
BTW friendly exit nodes out of the tour

652
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,460
just connecting hundreds and hundreds of

00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,340
hundreds of times over tour and gleaning

654
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,990
out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BT friendly ones and then</font>

655
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,649
specifying those exit nodes in our

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,650
startup script

657
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,430
it's all automatic right now like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

658
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the script and if you have it</font>

659
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,200
installed you're good you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea tour</font>

660
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:44,489
and iptables installed that's all you

661
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,830
need to do oh I did forget one thing if

662
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:50,100
you run the code yourself right now it's

663
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,169
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up to do the subnet routing so</font>

664
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,240
on the network all you have to do is set

665

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever the floodgate</font>

666
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:13,950
box is that's it and that so there we go

667
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:16,280
thank you guys I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh he</font>

ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

669
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:48,350
hello I don't actually I wish now I wish

670
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:55,809
that I had water in there let's see if

671
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:55,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this works how did you switch it over</font>

672
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:06,399
it's beautiful all right hang on guys

673
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually made slides which makes me</font>

674
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:15,219
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this talk might be longer</font>

675
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:17,170
than it should be I'm Madeline I'm also

taboo I'm not an infosec tech person I

678
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:28,900
am a media design person i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am the pr</font>

00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:35,410
ducky so fondly calls me so I when we

681
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,659
were talking earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've been</font>

682
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,420
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people here from various</font>

683
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:43,330
hackerspaces um one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

684
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:46,630
been coming up a lot is how to advertise

685
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:48,639
the space how whether or not i guess the

686
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:52,090
resounding debate whether or not media

687
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,739
is good for you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a</font>

688
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:57,330
little bit about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um my disclaimer</font>

689
00:34:53,739 --> 00:35:00,220
is that I'm not anything to do with PR I

690
00:34:57,330 --> 00:35:01,930
like it I'm good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it I know people</font>

691
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:06,009
that are professionals and they help me

692
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:07,839
out and so I do this stuff for free side

693
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,640
it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work pretty well I don't</font>

694
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:15,430
guarantee it if it doesn't work for you

695
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,990
um so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip over the what's a</font>

696
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,600
hackerspace<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we've done a pretty</font>

697
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:22,479
good job and the earlier talks about

698
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I know a majority of you know your</font>

699
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,440
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackerspaces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are parts of them all</font>

700
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:31,660
of that jazz so in regards to media in

701
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,640
regards to hackerspaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

702
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,940
biggest issue that people come across is

703
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,170
goal setting and it always starts and

704
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,130
you tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear these stories of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

705
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,770
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting together and</font>

706
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,960
saying hey you technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you hacker</font>

707
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:46,570
I'm hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh awesome let's start a</font>

708
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,280
group and it goes from there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

709
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,650
start dealing with monetary you start

710
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,600
dealing with nonprofit status and it

711
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,260
gets messy and traumatic and people cry

712
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:59,220
and it hurts and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of it you</font>

713
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neat little organization sort of</font>

714
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,689
what tends to happen is you start

715
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,029
getting together you lose sight<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

716
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,000
fact that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a non-profit and that</font>

717
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:12,340
the goals of a hackerspace and why we do

718
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,320
it and the fact is is yes it's fun and

719
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,880
we all like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

720
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,450
break things take things apart build

721
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,780
things but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also is about community</font>

722
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,470
bill

723
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:25,810
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about education</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as scary as it</font>

724
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,089
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best and easiest way to do</font>

725
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is to start dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

726
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:34,660
your community and usually through media

727
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:36,850
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've talked a</font>

728
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,200
lot to some PR directors whether

729
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,770
officially or non official in other

730
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,149
spaces and there comes a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font>

731
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,550
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> once a year when there's time to</font>

732
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:49,420
reevaluate what the goals are why you're

733
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:51,760
doing what you're doing so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

734
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,100
questions that we build is you know we

735
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,750
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rethink every time what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

736
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,770
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accomplish is it community</font>

737
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,300
education and is it doing startups you

738
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:03,850
know what message what are you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

739
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:07,000
convey there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hacker spaces</font>

740
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,080
that are perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine being with each</font>

741
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,670
other and being in their own little

742
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,890
bubble and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wanting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring</font>

743
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,510
new people in and teaching each other

744
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,190
and not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting to do anything</font>

745
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the outside world and that's just</font>

746
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,990
fine but that needs to be part of

747
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,840
whatever you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to accomplish and</font>

752
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,230
goals like hey I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came with this really</font>

753
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,180
cool project let's build it and you

754
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget that a year down the line that</font>

755
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,089
there's other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get</font>

756
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,740
done otherwise you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

757
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">this really cool project and you're</font>

758
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have absolutely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

759
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:47,529
infrastructure whatsoever to show it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

760
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:50,350
people and to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and to let</font>

761
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,270
other people other spaces the media

762
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,339
whatever see it say hey that's cool you

763
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">what else we could do and so there's</font>

764
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:58,750
this little gap in time and so the

765
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,460
important thing is whenever as an

766
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:03,490
individual when you're working on

767
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:06,370
projects and as a group<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

768
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">think okay I'm starting this now what am</font>

769
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,359
I going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do later with this can I</font>

770
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,640
publish it somewhere can I have another

771
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:16,390
space work on it would you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

772
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,940
info sharing here the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> little thing</font>

773
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,890
matching strategy to budget we talked

774
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:24,460
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and free said when we</font>

775
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:26,730
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do big events and suddenly we</font>

776
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,990
realize that we have no money<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

777
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,390
there are ways to do it for cheap and

778
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:32,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">free word this is the perfect crowd to</font>

779
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:36,270
be talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things for</font>

780
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,530
cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and free just remember that we're</font>

781
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,690
all so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice nasty</font>

782
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,210
little surprise in your budget leader um

783
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,069
and talking what we talked about earlier

784
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:47,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> media is not out to get you</font>

785
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:49,859
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was listening to the talk</font>

786
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,740
earlier and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah you do</font>

787
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:55,078
actually have to be kind of wary we've

788
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,450
had a couple people approach us

789
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,359
reporters and it's been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious</font>

790
00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:03,419
that what they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you know that</font>

791
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">stereotypical hacker in the basement and</font>

792
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,150
you know doing really sketch things stay

793
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,379
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that it's really hard to pick</font>

794
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:14,970
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces but point being is</font>

795
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">hackerspaces are this big bubble and</font>

796
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,799
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool and people talk about</font>

797
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">it all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

798
00:39:18,799 --> 00:39:25,980
and the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

799
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:27,509
know about it is if you tell them<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

800
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,520
they tell someone else most of what

801
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:31,140
we've gotten has been through contacts

802
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,150
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one people saying hey I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just did this</font>

hackerspaces org does not get as much

818
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,160
attention as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it deserves there are</font>

big on blogs anyone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has free said</font>

830
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:44,550
noticed that like I her ass everyone

831
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:48,750
the blog mostly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

832
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:50,820
there's the more lately what the reason

833
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:55,020
that I am so bothersome about the blog

834
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:57,120
is because the sources like hackaday and

835
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,310
make and<font color="#E5E5E5"> craft will hunt down the</font>

894
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,310
every month it sounds its credibility

895
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,590
and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend that and then</font>

896
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:31,170
involving other spaces there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

897
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:34,160
lot of this with conventions now and

898
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:38,340
just people talking and wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

899
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,109
communication via email IRC groups just

900
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,580
visiting other spaces talking to them

901
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,710
seeing what they're working on the

902
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,450
synchronous hackathon has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> fantastic</font>

903
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:47,970
in getting other spaces working together

904
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:50,609
and there's all sorts of collaboration

905
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,080
on projects and competitions I think

906
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,330
that's particularly fun to do

907
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,900
competitions with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other faces on</font>

908
00:43:54,330 --> 00:44:00,210
projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time whatever it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feels like</font>

909
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,830
so and that is what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing if you</font>

910
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,840

911
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:08,330
starting a hackerspace if you are in one

912
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,330
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to me I'm around</font>

915
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,089
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to take a little bit more</font>

time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about but uh let's go do</font>

917
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,850
this and second part of my first

918
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,790
presentation but I'd end up not doing

919
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,380
that anyway uh basically little

920
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">microcontroller project I'm working on</font>

921
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,190
my name's Aidan Quinn sure enough about

922
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,200
me have we gotten food all that in the

923
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,480
previous talk a little bit story

924
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,830
shmoocon 2010<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was giving something</font>

925
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,720
called a phantom keystroke or as a

926
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,160
speaker's gift that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to</font>

927
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,750
sing and what does is it toggles on and

928
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,250
off caps lock moves and mouse around us

929
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,080
cred like that just to be an annoying to

930
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,090
the person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has it plugged in it's</font>

931
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,290
basically a practical joke but I started

932
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,520
thinking about it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would happen if</font>

933
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,930
it were tryin I'm tryin to start with my

934

best buy co<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines man in personation</font>

935
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,190
right now I thought about what had

936
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:00,359
happen if you could program it it's also

937
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,190
cool things might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

938
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,470
will gadget so I started looking around

939
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:06,420
saying hook in this well while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

940
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:08,640
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I happened to see Darren kitchen</font>

941
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,410

943
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,220
was like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you feel some</font>

944
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,799
drugs auto button is turned off by

945
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,359
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> when so many machines now it'd</font>

946
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,980
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at way if you can do like a usb</font>

947
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,960
hid device human interface devices you

948
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:23,430
just plug in automatically throws the

949
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,840
keystrokes you want and you'll get

950
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,480
around those problems where autorun is

951
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,800
turned off well he told me<font color="#E5E5E5"> well me and</font>

00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">Robert are kind of working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a project</font>

953
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,820
similar to that well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> start looking</font>

954
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,410
around like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool i'm looking</font>

955
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,580
forward with the guy coming out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

956
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,960
got impatient and start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

957
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,700
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product that would kind of do it</font>

958
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,850
and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called Kinsey if</font>

959
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:42,930
you want something<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to wait</font>

960
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,220
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the product to come out it's come a</font>

961
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:46,680
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more professional than</font>

00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ducky will eventually be up on hak5 org</font>

966
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,330
the development on the coating on that

967
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:02,520
but if you want just play around there

968
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea and you're not wanting to go</font>

970
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:09,330
go ugly early as they say then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

971
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,950
this way of going about creating

972
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:13,080
yourself a little USB HID device might

973
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,600
just work first of all a few notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

974
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,950

00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:40,790
you plug it in and set to go off eight

1018
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:42,260
hours actually you plug it in so an

your fun side by volume label because

00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,540
when you plug a thumb drive in you don't

1032

<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get but</font>

1033
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,750
those ways of finding it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out if you know</font>

1034
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:14,330
the volume label which we do because we

1035
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,470
set it all up also you can make it go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1036
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,210
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain website like you know this</font>

1042
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,279
something silly<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what's the</font>

1043
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:30,020
name<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to think of a name for this</font>

1044
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,270
particular project because you know name

1045
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,609
is important in marketing isn't it so

1046
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:37,160
first thing Mickey pwned because the

1047

1051
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,940
know I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the ADA might you</font>

1052
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:47,279
know sue<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for trademark infringement</font>

1053
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,870
owner the next thing I thought about was

1054
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,220
a dipstick because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make</font>

1055
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,589
a smaller version of it where I started

1056
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:55,049
on a dip and I basically put this all in

1057
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:57,000
a nicer casing something like this make

1058
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,260
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> fungi sighs but I start thinking</font>

1059
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,910
about that dipstick this one to see what

1060
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,020
the thing is so then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought well how</font>

1061
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:02,910
about something a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more</font>

1062
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:05,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">descriptive like programmable hid USB</font>

1063
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,390
keyboard mouse dongle but that's a

1064
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,710
mouthful so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just see if we can get</font>

1065
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:14,069
a decent acronym out of that mmm okay

1066
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:16,310
yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got an acronym what is so</font>

1067
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:21,060
that's what I'm going with currently uh

1068
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:22,440
okay we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some names but uh but not</font>

1069
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,700
how to build one so I did some googling

1070
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,470
around for something that would let me

1071
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,730
do this found some limited items with

1072
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,089
easiest thing I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this on is</font>

1073
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">something called a tinsy now 10 C is a</font>

1078
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,450
do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with that on a</font>

00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,870

1081
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,250
simpler program cross between eighteen

1082
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:52,440
to twenty seven dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this little</font>

1083

one was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighteen dollars burnt out</font>

1084
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,910
some leads done and I'm anyone's project

1085
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:59,340
but it still works um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> better i got</font>

1086
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:01,440
cold solder joints a USB HID supports

1087
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,320
the big thing and you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

1088
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,420
from a pj RC<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm I I have a little</font>

1089
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,340
simple wiring diagram here for the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1090
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,020
created it's in the box I'll explain

1091
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the photoresist of this for in a</font>

1092
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,070
second you have analog and digital

1093
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:16,170
inputs on air the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital inputs I just</font>

1094
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,790
have set<font color="#E5E5E5"> for switches all go into a</font>

1095
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,470
common ground so basically goes to

1096
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,300
common ground is considered on in the

1097
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,459
particular case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I have it</font>

1098
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,980
all set up using some code to execute

1099
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,000
something when I'm ready and I explained

1100
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,800
that photo resistor<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like i</font>

1101
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,990
said here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple bit of code</font>

1102
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,320
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably too small to see that</font>

1103
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:37,259
uh just tells the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LED to come on just as</font>

1104
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,690
a diagnostic and then sends keystrokes

1105
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,460
in this particular key in this specific

1106
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:43,830
case all it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is bring up notepad and</font>

1107
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,040
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aidan was here all this code and so</font>

1108
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:48,990
forth will be on my website when i get

1109
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,550
back home<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the con a little bit more</font>

1110
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:52,020
complicated example would be something

1111
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,609
along the lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modern dipstick</font>

1112
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:56,589
here

1113
00:51:53,609 --> 00:52:00,130
hear what I've done and where if you

1114
00:51:56,589 --> 00:52:02,680
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 a selection of dip switch</font>

1115

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible of 256 combinations</font>

00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do I'm only using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

1117
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,420
combinations because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch out some of</font>

1118
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,558
my leads you might wanna buy this thing

1119
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:12,579
for me later on so I can buy a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new one</font>

1120
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">for doing research let me know I had to</font>

1121
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:15,760
turn on pull-up resistors they have

1122
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,308
built-in pull-up resistors inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1123
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the chip which is nice so I'd turn those</font>

1124
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:21,819
on to make them automatically go high

1125
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,578
and basically I check if anything goes

1126
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:25,750
low if something goes low and by the way

1127
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:28,089
I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their Adreno</font>

1128
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:29,619
programming environment because see see

1129
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:31,960
you can do it all and see but it's gonna

1130
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:34,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a little bit more it's gonna be a</font>

1131
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more details that you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1132
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,868
to bother with to hear the details are

1133
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,118
more hidden from you<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

1134
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:42,160
basically this one but command bar bring

1135
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:44,680
up notepad<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aiden was here this one right</font>

1136
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,029
here does a ctrl alt delete and I have

1137
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,348
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different commands are the</font>

1138
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:50,430
one for actually finding a thumb drive

1139
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:54,819
is right here use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> form command and</font>

1140
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:56,799
wmic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my particular thumb</font>

1141
00:52:54,819 --> 00:53:00,880
drive by its name and Bob's your uncle

1142
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:04,109
I'm in let's see but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1143
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:08,369
demonstrate this thing real quick I

1144
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:08,369
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had more readers on me</font>

1145
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,339
eventually I'm gonna have this all

1146
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,750
packaged up in something much nicer but

1147
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:15,730
like i said i'm having some bad luck

1148
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,859
with dribbling the things out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

1149
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:21,849
need the dremel out but let's test our

1150
00:53:17,859 --> 00:53:23,920
few toes functions let's bring that up

1151
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:25,930
first time<font color="#CCCCCC"> your chest out is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1152
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">dhryn was here and basically the idea is</font>

1153
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,390
I can set the dip switch what I want to

1154
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,130
do plug it in real quick pull it back

1155
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,379
out remember these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i'm showing</font>

1156
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:34,539
use timers as if yet but right no reason

1157
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,190
they can't use timers number four is

1158
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:37,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">control too late hit enter i'm not going</font>

1159
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:40,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that off because of time reasons</font>

1160
00:53:37,569 --> 00:53:41,890
obvious number six is just moves the

1161
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:44,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">mouse around and clicks which is just</font>

1162
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:47,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">annoying and walk me to my next door</font>

1163
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,789
screen

1164
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:56,510
also you should turn it off before you

1165
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,009
try to go continue I number<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven opens</font>

1166
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:59,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">up a website and this could be like the</font>

1167
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:01,010
Facebook example in this case I just

1168
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">have autumn and go to my website but</font>

1169
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,400
since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have an internet</font>

1170
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,310
connection right now as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1171
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be maddening in some cases did you</font>

1172
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:16,580
see a thumb drive me pop I brought up

1173
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:19,520
here Oh bingo and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one I have</font>

1174
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:21,440
set up on there is you'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thumb</font>

1175
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,450
drive by its volume name in this case I

1176
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:28,250
had this thing called my thumb so that

1177
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:30,799
whenever i plug this in boom issues that

1178
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">full command poof</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WIC and it runs this</font>

1179
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,250
and it can run any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1180
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,169
want obviously you want the time delay

1181
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,330
to be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just turned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1182
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:41,510
very low for the sake of showing it off

1183
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:43,930
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can find a script knows what</font>

1184
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:47,680
scripts running from start copying files

1185
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:51,620
bring up calculator that's the classic

1186
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,480
notepad regedit so on so forth but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1187
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,940
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the general idea another</font>

1188
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,990
thing that I've come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with was and</font>

1189
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:01,760
this is the reason i had that photo

1190
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:05,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">resistor set up is uh oh that's why I</font>

1191
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,810
had that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the reason I had the</font>

1192
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:10,190
photoresistor setup is so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1193
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:15,650
hook a sense of up to it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1194
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:19,120
analog input in this case let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope</font>

1195
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:19,120
this work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the wires came loose</font>

1196
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,050
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have it set to go off as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

1197
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,240
as someone turns on the lights in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1198
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:27,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">office or five minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after they turn</font>

1199
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,209
off light to know turn on the lights<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1200
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,210
the office whatever you care to do and

1201
00:55:31,210 --> 00:55:34,210
see

1202
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:39,570
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have way too much crap open</font>

1203
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:41,099
luckily I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about shift f5 that's</font>

1204
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,030
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internals of it no max I'm</font>

1205
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:44,820
looking on a smaller one I got the

1206
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,740
altoids tin for some stuff it's booked

1207
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,150
in progress otherwise I have embed a hub

1208
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of storage so you have it all</font>

1209
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:51,630
in one nice unit because then you could

1210
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one thumb drive satisfying the</font>

1211
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:54,330
head storage on it and you can

1212
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:56,250
automatically do what you need to do

1213
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,930
leave around like a fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive package</font>

1214
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,940
and hoping some unsuspecting user will

1215
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:01,379
pick it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it people do that</font>

1216
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">with usually thumb drive so I no reason</font>

1217
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,940
they wouldnt do it this Trojan hardware

1218
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,550
give someone a cool glow in the dark

1219
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:10,349
rubber toy or give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> some hard drive</font>

1220
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,730
or why say it's a wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> device and</font>

1221
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:13,560
have it wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up after a certain amount</font>

1222
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,670
of time issue these commands but you

1223
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,799
give to them as a present they just

1224
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:18,440
think it's a regular USB toy but it has

1225
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">this kind of hidden functionality in it</font>

1226
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:25,200
and if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some kind of cover-up</font>

1227
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,760
thing I mean no one suspects when I

1228
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,480
computer squeaks out a little bit they

1229
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,310
just think it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things</font>

1230
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,460
people don't necessarily pay attention

1231
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:34,799
also if I were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> BIOS boot password</font>

1232
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,089
boot forcing but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scouts right on</font>

1233
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,950
that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably if you have</font>

1234
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:39,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time to access in front of the</font>

1235
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Machine better Dolphus whip in the drive</font>

1236
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:44,190
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right few links for more</font>

1237
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,300
information eventually hacked files can

1238
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,380
be having something out<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this I'm</font>

1239
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna have some of my web page before</font>

1240
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,270
too awful long<font color="#CCCCCC"> tin see product pages out</font>

1241
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,310
there and the code will all be out there

1242
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,960
open source on my website before too

1243
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,029
awful long by the way you can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

1244
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,490
up the vendor ID and the product ID i

1245
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:02,250
set mine to be like zero six six six and

1246
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:05,009
13 13 and the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the product was</font>

1247
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,660
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cthulhu keyboard and mouse events</font>

1248
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,160
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked about earlier and i would</font>

1249
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:11,480
say any questions but it with me later

1250
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,480
because we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the next person up</font>

1251
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:27,030
I come up talk to me in a bit if he

1252
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:38,970
wants to physically see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff later</font>
