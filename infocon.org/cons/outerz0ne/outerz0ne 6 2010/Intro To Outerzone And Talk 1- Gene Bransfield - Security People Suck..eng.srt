308
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,950
the Bible as a metaphor similar to other

309
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,480
hackers using Star Wars as a metaphor

310
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i was using Star Wars as a</font>

315
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,190
Pentecost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apostles receive the gift</font>

316
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:31,670
of tongues so when they speak everybody

317
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,170
hears them and understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> them now this</font>

318
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,640
was not done but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went around to each</font>

319
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,130
possible and let him speak every other

320
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,350
language no the Apostle spoke and this

321
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,300
guy whatever his nationality heard and

322
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">understood it so this is kind of like</font>

323
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,870
God's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going say okay I don't want the</font>

324
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,360
risk of teaching this guy to speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> Farsi</font>

325
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,490
so instead of him speaking Farsi I'm

326
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,960
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that guy he'll speak</font>

Jewish and the guy out there a hear it

328
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,660
in Farsi it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a program</font>

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,050
just push it out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and you</font>

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,990
successful public relations trick and it

335
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,520
was spread Christianity far and wide of

336
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,570

I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> even slower and even louder</font>

419
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:31,500
please take me to and he says speak

420
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,940
engrish so that really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of killed my</font>

421
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,440
ego right there but I didn't realize

422
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">what they teach you in these classes is</font>

423
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,620
a formal way of speaking Korean of

424
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,059
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not how it happens the</font>

425
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,949
real world you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you walk out what's</font>

426
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,389
up man right that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you greet each</font>

427
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,880
other you don't say hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir how are</font>

428
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,830
you today let's same all over the place

429
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,620
so and you also learned that culture

430
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,418
knowing the culture goes a lot further

431
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,620
toward communicating in a foreign

432
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,440
language than just learning the

433
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,879
vocabulary because there are nuances we

434
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,429
use them here he<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak male to female</font>

435
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the young proper and improper forms</font>

436
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,110
of language it happens subtly under the

437
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,760
table you realize it but you don't

438
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,469
realize it because there's a basic

439
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding of things that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

440
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,299
internally that somebody from another

culture doesn't know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

442
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,049
cultures won't correct you if they

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize that you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it because</font>

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,928
most of Asian cultures rice is life it

447
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,460
goes beyond food it's almost a religion

448
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,809
you know back in the day when there was

449
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,340
no food and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be very happy to</font>

450
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,860
tell you this because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,000</font>

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of recorded history</font>

452
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,490
during the famine we ate rice and if we

453
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,639
didn't eat rice we'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all died so</font>

454
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,820
it's more like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rice so you're sitting</font>

455
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">there as an American in Asia eating with</font>

457
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,340
food and drink beer right so you put

458
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,659
down the bowl of rice you stick the

459
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:55,280
chopsticks in the rice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you pick up</font>

460
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,900
your beer right bad juju sticking the

461
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,190
chopsticks in the rice either sticking

462
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,590
straight in or just sort of leaving it

463
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,380
in the bowl is like symbolically

464
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,850
stabbing life in the chest if you're

465
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved if you're over at somebody's</font>

466
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,990
house for dinner you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really</font>

467
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,730
insulted the hostess if you're in

468
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,500
somebody's establishment you wish to bad

469
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,179
things upon their establishment<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

470
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,970
really bad stuff it's extraordinarily

471
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,980
offensive and I didn't realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

472
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody told it to me until a buddy of</font>

473
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,549
mine who was a missionary to Korea in

474
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,140
his younger days he said what the hell

475
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,570
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing and he didn't explain this</font>

476
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,250
all to me I've been pissing these people

477
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,770
off for about five months at this point

478
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,080
and nobody told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about it why because</font>

479
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,790
I wasn't part of their culture and I

480
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,409
didn't understand so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't even</font>

481
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">bother explaining that I was pissing</font>

482
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,910
them off this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

483
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,520
then this is not just in Asia I mean you

484
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,320
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about British once again back to</font>

485
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,139
the Brits they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say to</font>

486
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,370
you like my mother is in hospital and

487
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,080
you're like what you mean in the

488
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:54,020
hospital no in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospital speak the</font>

489
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,350
Queen's English they're very pompous but

490
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,150
I mean that's the it's subtle but it's

491
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,689
real and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> essential to</font>

492
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,460
communications so we got to understand

493
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,620
the culture and understanding their

494
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,169
motivations objections fears uncertainty

495
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,750
in doubt we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> fud to mo flood</font>

496
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,190
and understanding the mo phut leads to

497
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,250
enhanced communications increased

498
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,840
victory decreased fail so who are our

499
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,679
different cultures business

500
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,178
professionals development community and

501
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,280
users yes the business professionals are

502
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:28,160
kind of like nobility<font color="#CCCCCC"> the developments</font>

503
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,020
are barbarians of course end users are

504
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,970
peasants no explanation needed there and

505
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,730
each culture is different because they

506
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different mo food ok so where does</font>

507
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,390
that leave the security professional

508
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,120
right who are we in this little better

509
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:44,250
we are the knights we are the knights

510

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,110
philosophers right well they're in

515
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge they have the money in the power</font>

516
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,649
they make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on academia</font>

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,960
numbers training experience and they

518
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,940
rarely seek the counsel from from those

519
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,559
whom their decisions affect directly so

520
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,960
they're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like nobility sitting up</font>

521
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:10,690
there going let them eat cake what are

524
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,610

525
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,230
organization toward profitability and a

526
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,320
lot of their decisions come down to get

527
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,659
a bonus or get fired that's pretty

528
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting if I made a bad decision got</font>

529
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:28,210
fired I'd probably do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more toward</font>

530
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,830
making a better decision and I've done

531
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it made a lot of bad decisions like you</font>

532
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,870
know presenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> an outer zone on two</font>

533
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,399
days notice but so we have to learn

534
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,809
their language and you're like wait a

535
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,239
minute why the hell do I have to learn

536
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,460
their language I'm the security guy

537
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,620
right they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be listening to me</font>

538
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,909
it's my friggin job to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I know a</font>

539
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,668
hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than they do about</font>

540
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:50,350
this so why do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn their</font>

541
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:51,549
language why shouldn't they learn my

542
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,860
language well there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several reasons</font>

543
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:56,649
that this argument is invalid the lesser

544
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,110
of those reasons being computer stuff is

545
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:01,299
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them you start talking</font>

546
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the slightest bit technical and</font>

547
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:04,990
their brain goes elsewhere they start

548
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,760
thinking about jujubes you know they

549
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,779
stop listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you almost immediately</font>

550
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,460
because you're a geek and because you're

551
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:13,929
a geek you obviously don't understand

552
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,429
it's the unwritten culture communication

553
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,570
here they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother to</font>

554
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,220
explain it to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

555
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,960
understand their mo food because you're

556
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,659
a geek not to mention the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

557
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,690
geeks tend to overreact to security

558
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:30,250
threats we do sometimes we really

559
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:37,240
overreact

560
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:38,860
I love this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have to</font>

561
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,630
learn their real reasons we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

562
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,479
learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that language like said they have</font>

563
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,880
the money<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the power we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">influence their decision because when</font>

565
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,140
all hell breaks loose and the system

566
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,690
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their bad decisions</font>

567
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:55,210
they don't call the CFO they don't call

568
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,870
the CEO they don't call the PM they call

569
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,370
you and what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the guy who made</font>

570
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,780
the bad decision while you're in there

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,639
wasting your weekend working on his

574
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,790
might be his wife so how do we suck

575
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,500
we're completely outside the

576
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,760
decision-making process here we're

577
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,740
viewing things from a security

578
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,510
perspective vice of business perspective

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand their lingo and we</font>

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">we start doing that well you can't</font>

582
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,240
really start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

583
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,450
until you understand his definition of

risk the official problem the official

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,690
definition from a business perspective

586
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,640
is the probability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss and firms</font>

587
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,170
operations and environment may impair

its ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide returns on</font>

589
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,010
investments business risk which is

590
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,450
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and product plus financial</font>

591
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,550
risk which is how much money we're

592
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:48,040
making versus how much we<font color="#CCCCCC"> owe equal</font>

593
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,260
total corporate risk handling this risk

594
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,700
determines job goodness of the noble

599
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,480
times you know exposure factor equals

600
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,830
single loss expectancy times annual rate

601
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,210
of occurrence equals annual loss

602
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,889
expectancy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think it's</font>

603
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">strange that people are using al when</font>

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">they choose their countermeasures a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the countermeasures I've seen guy had</font>

607
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,480
that in there but I like my definition

608
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,280
of risk which is do I have to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

609
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,570
my beer turn off my hockey game and<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

610
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,040
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

611
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,860
broken because of your dumbass decision

612
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,889
model that's my favorite definition of

613
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,770
risk because I really like my beer in my

614
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,950
hockey games so problem with risk is its

615
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,970
objective at certain levels and in any

616
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,800
mathematical model you know that one

617
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,400
 number screws up the entire

618
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,200
thing now an economist will stand

619
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,390
here and argue with me that these models

620
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,850
are not subjective but they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

621
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,950
the recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> economic crisis resulted in</font>

622
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,689
decisions by corporate finance guys and

623
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,340
those decisions were justified via a

624
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:55,370
risk analysis that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together by</font>

625
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,470
really hard math and very subjective

626
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:59,600
numbers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put one piece of</font>

627
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,580
into the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and it all goes to</font>

628
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,320
hell it's a demonstration how risk

629
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,120
justification process can be very

630
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,139
nebulous there are other things that

631
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,649
people aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking into consideration</font>

632
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,930
in risk in my opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example let's</font>

633
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,200
talk about this guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robert Hanssen it</font>

634
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:16,940
was a mole at the boo thank you yes

635
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,130
this guy I hate this guy the mole at the

636
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,230
FBI he was working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the USSR he</font>

637
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,000
exposed the existence of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> covert tunnel</font>

638
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,610
under the Soviet embassy the tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

639
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,170
hundred million dollars to build when it

640
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,909
was built the intelligence was worthless

641
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:30,470
but we didn't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the Russians</font>

642
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,940
were feeding misinformation into the

643
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,400
intelligence community what's the annual

644
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,960
loss expectancy involved in this are we

645
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include the amount of money</font>

648
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,250
tip provide action on the intelligence

649
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were getting for that tunnel the</font>

650
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:46,880
intelligence which was false how about

651
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,929
the lives lost acting on that

652
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,790
intelligence something to think about so

653
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:54,170
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization being first</font>

and somebody stealing your system

something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about so we've</font>

667
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,890
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their mofo let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

one example of success<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have I</font>

worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the Air</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> National Guard network</font>

671
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:30,620
ago this is in the early 2000 time frame

672
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,760
and in our Air National Guard you know

673
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,639
one weekend a month two weeks a year

674
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,800
they all they have like one or two sites

675
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,500
per state and territory so that's like

676
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:42,080
120 sites coming through one security

677
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,020
center and I was the only guy doing

678
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,460
security well there were a couple there

679
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,950
were a couple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know government people</font>

680
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,050
in there but yeah I was the only guy

681
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:53,180
doing security so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a lot of worms</font>

682
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,169
disguised as dot zip files in the email

683
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,330
sure you all remember when that

684
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,820
wonderfulness was going on so natural

685
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,800
just blocked odds if at the smtp gateway

686
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,290
right BAM fixes the problem immediately

687
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick and simple dirty well the peasants</font>

688
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:08,330
revolted you can't block dot zip at the

689
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,060
gateway my mission is being effective

690
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:13,790
effective affected pardon me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

691
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:16,280
hungover<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time you deal with these</font>

692
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,629
the DoD anything if you do something

693
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like their first argument</font>

694
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,960
back to you is you're affecting my

695
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,790
mission<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't complete my mission</font>

696
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,760
people are going to die<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you're</font>

697
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,320
blocking dot zip at the gateway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

698
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't really argue with this because</font>

699
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,129
they have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large voice their other</font>

700
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,480
argument was that we've already updated

701
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,220
our virus signatures that's going to

702
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop the attacks let the dot zip through</font>

703
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,850
and I'm like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know no your</font>

704
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,010
virus signatures will stop this attack

705
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,629
they change one little thing and they

706
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,460
named it dot zip and the attack happens

707
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,860
all over again know that fell on deaf

708
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,020
ears so the peasants once security lost

709
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we repeated the above scenario like</font>

710
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,700

opportunities you're wasting dollars

719

you're affecting your mission readiness

720
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,780
and I had all the data to back this up

gather the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data it makes a much more</font>

729
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:42,020

computers scared him he was a manager

734
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,040
where computer guys the stuff that's

735
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,679
extraordinarily easy to us is

736
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,080
extraordinarily complicated to them this

737
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,540
is talking about understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mo</font>

742
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:11,859

00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:13,719
as that later it was adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the air</font>

00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:14,830
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air force</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large and DOD but i'm</font>

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to claim victory for that</font>

746
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,149
because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font>

well they haven't done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that though sure</font>

749
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:34,020
I doubt it it's entirely possible the

750
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,850
question was well won't the virus

751
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,430
writers just rename everything from from

752

zip<font color="#CCCCCC"> dip is it's entirely possible but</font>

00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they'll do that but they</font>

754
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,340
haven't because they're getting a lot

755
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,350
bigger market share to non DoD

756
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,510
organizations really and they don't

757
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,520
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not looking for this guy they're</font>

758
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:52,950
looking for everyone there's there are

759
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,420
worm attacks that are spearfishing worm

760
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,070
attacks that go on all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that are</font>

761
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:00,170
looking for that guy the guys who wrote

762
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,550
this you know they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted boxes so</font>

763
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,900
the complete set of instructions were

764
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,330
sent to the peasants they bitched but

765
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,190
that's what peasants do who cares they

766
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,610
put it put me in a trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor</font>

status with my boss which was good it

768
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:15,149
achieved my security goals and gave him

769
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,428
pointed business reasons that he could

770
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,050
use to justify his excellence to his

771
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:20,940
boss and made him look good wise

772

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,559
who for reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could still don't</font>

784
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,960
so if you hear somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> use as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I make</font>

786
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,059
well he'll make 150 thousand dollars a

decisions that he makes directly affect

789
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,740
his bonus if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you screw up at work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

cost-benefit analyses in so metrics

796
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,429
there's a security metrics book written

also the statistics you know the old

810
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,289
joke about a doctor a lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> an engineer</font>

in statistician applying for the same

812
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:43,009
job they asked the doctor during the

813
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:45,499
interview what's two plus two is my

814
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:46,999
diagnosis is for I asked the lawyer

815
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:49,039
what's two plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> twos is based on the</font>

was 2 plus 2 he says any fuckhead knows

818
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:54,649
it's for does their engineers they asked

the statistician what's two plus two is

820
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:58,059
what what what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it to be</font>

821
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,100
telling the story another way you gotta

822
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,049
look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and what it says I told</font>

823
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,939
a bunch of router guys to put some

824
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,220
access lists on their router because

825
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,840
they were getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> pounde i wrote the</font>

826
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,519
access list for them I know how to do

827
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i gave the to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i did all the</font>

828
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,850
work is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you need to do is put</font>

829
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:19,549
this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router so they bitched to</font>

830
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:22,279
their management says these access lists

831
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:25,340
increase our<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU utilization on our</font>

832
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,429
routers by twenty percent that sounds

833
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,269
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I looked at the data</font>

834
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:31,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">s'okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what you're telling</font>

835
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:34,779
me is that the CPU utilization went from

836
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:39,279
20 to 24 that's not a significant hit

837
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:41,629
but they were telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> truth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as was i</font>

838
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,070
we had another situation talking about

839
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:44,418
reciprocity in the government you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

840
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,739
to bring a system to the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

841
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:48,200
to go through certification and

842
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:49,879
accreditation the thing is driving

843
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,529
developers mad is that it goes through

844
00:33:49,879 --> 00:33:53,600
certification and accreditation at this

845
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,279
agency and they bring it to another

846
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,019
agency and has to start the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process all</font>

847
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,570
over again so this is absolutely insane

848
00:33:57,019 --> 00:34:02,299
why are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this so we talked about</font>

849
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,980
reciprocity it gets done here then we

850
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:05,330
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over here and you just do a</font>

851
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,470
couple residual tests for your

852
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,668
environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're good you don't</font>

853
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,809
have to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> another six-month</font>

854
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:10,579
process well there are certain people

855
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:13,220
out there that think this is a big bad

856
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,349
idea and they did a presentation we did

857
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:17,598
a security event with that group and

858
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,190
they came to a security conference and

859
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,470
they gave the presentation this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

860
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,000
reciprocity won't work we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this</font>

861
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:25,609
work with these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> that took all this</font>

862
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,750
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are still 20 outstanding</font>

863
00:34:25,609 --> 00:34:28,159
findings that we couldn't address

864
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:32,418
therefore we could not approve this

865
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,589
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were right and then I</font>

866
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,618
had the benefit of giving a presentation

867
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,029
the next day and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay everything</font>

868
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,429
they said was true what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

869
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,190
telling you is they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hundred</font>

870
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and some-odd requirements the effort we</font>

871
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,418
put in together with them took less time

872
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:50,388
and we satisfied all but twin

873
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:52,368
requirements furthermore it will take

874
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,809
about two weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and Reever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

about business business is

900
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,400
boring oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god I mean learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

901
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,619
business it interrupts my thirst for

902
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,569
knowledge about technology & Hallis

903
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:53,210
we can't be elite hacks or reading a

904
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:59,990
finance book right get the over

905
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:01,910
yourself seriously seriously this the

906
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,919
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effort putting into the</font>

907
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,899
mean after learning DNS and learning

908
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,880
tcp/ip and learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual</font>

909
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,250
so if reading this business stuff is

910
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,869
really simple I mean the finance gets

911
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,210
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> really complicated math but you</font>

912
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,920
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that it's not that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

913
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,510
compared to the amount of brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

914
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,119
takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of our day-to-day stuff</font>

915
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,280
and it will go a long way toward helping

916
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,109
you out developers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they</font>

917
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,940
programmers system administrators code

918
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,710
monkeys wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Apes etc they're all</font>

919
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,119
developers why because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

920
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,010
somebody to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> an application you</font>

921
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,930
hire a programmer right need somebody to

922
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,270
set up a web server you hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sysadmin</font>

923
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,609
right so they're all developers they

924
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,319
have to develop a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for why are</font>

925
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,609
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling them by Barrett barbarians</font>

926
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:42,500
where they're hard to do a specific job

927
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:44,029
they're very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that job so they're</font>

928
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like mercenaries but mercenaries</font>

929
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,450
were barbarians back in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

930
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:49,368
the Roman Empire time says sometimes

931
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,470
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very socially acceptable to</font>

932
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:53,359
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys they don't want to be</font>

933
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,970
seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackers and developers</font>

934
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,589
they kind of keep them to the side these

935
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,149
developers are also much more likely to

936
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,970
belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Society for Creative</font>

Anachronism

938
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,509
therefore they justify their ownership

939
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,980
of a sword and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font>

940
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,710
sword against me what they have the

941
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity what is their mo foot oh</font>

942
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,340
they build a system to requirements they

943
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,200
make it work beautifully they go home

944
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,260
and they now get called at 3am and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

945
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,939
get paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> on time that's it sits</font>

946
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,830
summarizing it very drastically but

947
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,359
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it so we're much more</font>

948
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,980
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their language but what</font>

949
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,990
about their motivations well what do

950
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,609
they do they build systems to

951
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,290
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what are their</font>

952
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,900
requirements from security what are we

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">livery will levying against them what we</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be secure I want you to use</font>

955
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,599
best practices it's on sands go to

956
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:40,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google dude it's not that hard just read</font>

957
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:43,109
right well I took a course for months

happy and sad because now they knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

974
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a vulnerability and so they looked at</font>

975
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:20,760
months and say well how do we fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

979
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,029
helping it's not where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security guy</font>

980

plot and they run<font color="#CCCCCC"> away that's not doing</font>

983
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,649
the developer any good he doesn't care

984
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,000
that is really does care that his broke

985
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,470
he wants to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to fix it and if</font>

you have a security<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy are those</font>

991
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,020
policy requirements written so that they

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:02,430
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be understood by a barbarian</font>

993
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:05,310
developer who's responsible for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

994
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:09,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">you ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read sarbanes-oxley or HIPAA</font>

995
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:13,369
you ever read<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST god that sucks</font>

996
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,019
with those written by developers now

997
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:17,059
they were written by lawyers and

998
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,140
bureaucrats who wants to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it vague</font>

999
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:20,599
enough such that will apply to

1000
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,190
everything but specific enough so they

1001
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,109
can nail your ass to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wall if the</font>

1002
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:27,440
situation provides itself because that's

1003
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:29,150
what lawyers and bureaucrats do so we're

1004
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,609
leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> these guys out to dry they come</font>

1005
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:32,779
to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> system they come to your area and</font>

1006
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:36,348
they say we're going to secure this

1007
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:37,789
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great go for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well how we</font>

1008
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,680
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> interpret these security</font>

1009
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:42,079
policies we need to translate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogus</font>

1010
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,308
jargon into actual requirements for

1011
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,349
these guys we need to help them

1012
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:49,269
implement those policies security guys

1013
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:52,839
need to do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we suck</font>

1014
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:56,238
there's very little of this going on and

1015
00:39:52,839 --> 00:40:00,529
here's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems schedule pays</font>

1016
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:02,449
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than security guy kawasaki's is</font>

1017
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:03,949
don't worry be crappy you got something

1018
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:05,420
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first to market it's the</font>

1019
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:07,190
difference between buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Ferrari and</font>

1020
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,979
buying a BMW this is what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

1021
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,900
compete against why is this scary well

1022
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:13,729
because the development of philosophy

1023
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,079
system has two sets of requirements to a

1024
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:16,669
developer they have the functional

1025
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,779
requirements they have the security

1026
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:23,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements this is epic fail that is</font>

1027
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:25,279
not true a system has system

1028
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,890
requirements which include the

1029
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:29,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">functional and security requirements you</font>

1030
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,009
shouldn't begin to develop a system

1031
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,359
without an understanding of full set of

1032
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:33,499
requirements right you wouldn't set up a

1033
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:35,019
web server if you didn't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1034
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:37,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that needed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do right</font>

1035
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:38,598
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that it needs</font>

1036
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,619
to do is be secure and if you haven't

1037
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:42,140
written down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security requirements</font>

1038
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the developer it's not going to get</font>

1039
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">done and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often more often than not</font>

1040
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,119
they do begin development<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they</font>

1041
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,509
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good understanding the</font>

1042
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,430
requirements this is bad why software is

1043
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:54,589
everywhere software is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1044
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,299
socio-economic system there's a great

1045
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:58,009
book out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> gekka nomics by David</font>

1046
00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:01,400
Rice go buy it read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it'll scare the</font>

1047
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:03,170
hell out of you is awesome and software

1048
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,089
industry right now is currently like the

1049
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,859
automobile and railroad industry in the

1050
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,058
beginning because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they thought okay</font>

1051
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:09,348
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just build stuff we're in</font>

1052
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:11,539
competition we're getting it lets a

1053
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,630
laissez-faire environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1054
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:15,709
dying yeah but that's user and error

1055
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,180
original automobiles even the big ones

1056
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:19,399
even the fast ones did not have

1057
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">seatbelts as late as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60s seatbelts</font>

1058
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,410
was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> option</font>

1059
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,210
item because they didn't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1060
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,759
the impression that cars were unsafe in

1061
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,550
any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape or form they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recently did</font>

1062
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,460
a test we think it was a late 70s early

1063
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:34,280
70s model of chevy impala and a current

1064
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:35,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">impala well you've ever seen a late 70s</font>

1065
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,910
and pilots a pretty big friggin car

1066
00:41:35,859 --> 00:41:40,450
current and<font color="#CCCCCC"> paula and they did a crash</font>

1067
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:44,060
test against them current and paula

1068
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,618
destroyed late 70s in power there was no

1069
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,529
way late 70s and paula guy would have

1070
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">survived that crash you know modern</font>

1071
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">impala he would got out and walked away</font>

1072
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,980
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 mile an hour head-on</font>

1073
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,450
collision this is government regulations

1074
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,010
in action the only problem is the

1075
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,049
government doesn't get involved until

1076
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:02,270
something really catastrophic happens

1077
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:04,940
and the population<font color="#E5E5E5"> rises up and says do</font>

1078
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:07,280
something about this we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not want the</font>

1079
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:09,710
government involved after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major</font>

1080
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,119
disaster in our industry we need to be

1081
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,990
proactive about it and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

1082
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken care of now because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever heard</font>

1083
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,319
the term<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're from Washington we're</font>

1084
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,200
here to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it sends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chills</font>

1085
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,869
down your spine oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like get</font>

1086
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,580
this guy out of my head so how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1087
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to alter this philosophy we write</font>

1088
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,299
a security policy we make it standard

1089
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,609
automatic and mandatory you have a

1090
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,650
prebuilt set of servers not just one

1091
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:36,440
pre-built server for everything a

1092
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:38,480
prebuilt mail server a prebuilt web

1093
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,980
server a prebuilt you know Active

1094
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,510
Directory server a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple different</font>

1095
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux box depending on the mission</font>

1096
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,320
problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> having one version of that</font>

1097
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it available</font>

1098
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,760
for everything so you have a web server

1099
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also does mail and DNS well you</font>

1100
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on your mail server or</font>

1101
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,960
your web server so we need to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1102
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,490
system of rebuilding a building in a

1103
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,140
system of rewards to the entire

1104
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,700
situation is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to do</font>

1105
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,279
this oracle and microsoft had currently

1106
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,589
used that act upon that system

1107
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,300
positively and negatively the good

1108
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:10,369
example that oracle gave was like they

1109
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,410
found somebody who wasn't no billing

1110
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:14,060
their system to security requirements he

1111
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,980
didn't get fired but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't get a</font>

1112
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,390
bonus or when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was talking about</font>

1113
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,930
bonuses earlier being part of somebody's

1114
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,990
salary yeah half your salary<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

1115
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,700
didn't do security and enforce those

1116
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,799
standards cuz it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not microsoft's fault</font>

1117
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,689
if your administrator log on his

1118
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,580
password or been straighter password is

1119
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,220
password nor is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oracle's fault if</font>

1120
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">scott tiger can log on to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1121
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,230
database that's your fault how not to

1122
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:46,270
suck a security level policy is written

1123
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:48,580
there how much time do I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool</font>

1124
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,530
so the policy is written enforcement's

1125
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> placed how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does your policy get in</font>

1126
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,210
valuated are you doing your job

1127
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,280
correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm I've got a couple of</font>

1128
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,750
scenarios written there so you're

1129
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,220
performing a security evaluation on the

1130
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and you notice that all machines</font>

1131
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,200
are vulnerable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the latest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft</font>

1132
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,210
RPC exploit do you pone those boxes if

1133

the organization vulnerable to attack

1171
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,630
you need to establish a configuration

days five days no server billions of

1178
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:44,290
dollars being lost so what had happened

1179
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,060
well one of the developers was out there

1180
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,710
doing some stuff he put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Jean he ran some tests against that</font>

1182
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,620
seemed to work it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was friday was late he</font>

1183
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:54,310
moved it to production nothing bad

1184
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,049
happened so he went home there was no

1185
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:58,180
configuration management policy in place

1186
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:01,000
nobody was tracking this stuff and so

1187
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,620
they didn't know what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> for five</font>

1188
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,730
days and they couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and fix</font>

1189
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:08,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but who got blamed security we just</font>

1190
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,930
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this money on all this stuff</font>

1191
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,670
to keep bad guys out narrow going

1192
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,140
through what must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in do s attack</font>

1193
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,300
because nothing bad has happened on our

1194
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,950
side right we did everything right that

1195
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,660
your security boxes that are keeping us

1196
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">offline so while he was updating his</font>

1197
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,990
resume they got the call they figured

1198
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what the problem was and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1199
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,399
subsequently exonerated but that was a

1200
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:29,800
shitty five days for him long story

1201
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,190
short configuration management policy

1202
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:36,760
will save the security guys but and also

1203
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:39,670
keep the damn developers in line sad

1204
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,960
truth how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> books are out there go to</font>

1205
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,200
the library how many books do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on</font>

1211
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,819
implement an effective patch management

00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:05,230
and configuration management policy I

1213
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:06,640
hate this slide as I like pen testing so

1214
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:08,440
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> number three you're evaluating</font>

1215

a system to control gate and a notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

developer says this fix is going to

1220
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,939
cause an unacceptable slip in my

1221
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,350
development schedule so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1222
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a big deal and we're just</font>

right schedule<font color="#CCCCCC"> pays better than security</font>

1225
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,380
so he's going to accept so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> says we</font>

1226
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,520
will accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

organization we're going to meet our

1228
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,270
date is that acceptable no the developer

1229
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,549
cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> recep accept risk on behalf of</font>

1230
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,070
the organization that's your CX<font color="#CCCCCC"> o's job</font>

1231
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:48,640
remember the guy who gets fired if it

1232
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:50,170
goes bad yeah not the developers job to

1233
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,120
interpret security requirements that's

1234
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,770
your job and if the developer doesn't

1235
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,960
answer understand security requirements

1236
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,190
then the security guy has failed and oh

1237
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,200
by the way they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask you</font>

1238
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:02,070

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,060
by the throat say what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing</font>

1240
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,680
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about when they were</font>

00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,300
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> detonate this atomic device you</font>

1247
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing exploding by Tuesday let's go</font>

1248
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,328
so you never develop never never depend

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,279
conquer the world well the Greeks

00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,930
conquered Troy the Greeks climbed into a

00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,810
Trojan horse it was a Greek horse I have

1259
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:54,700
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument with that about most</font>

1260
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,440
security guys but or post history guys

1261
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,939
but the Greeks got in the horse they

1262
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,770
pulled it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Troy and they they got</font>

1263
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside the walls and then they let out</font>

1264
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,420
their other Greeks in number one killer

1265

of all mankind is diseased heart kidney

1266

have anything wrong until it's too late

1269
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,589
people will lock their doors people will

1270
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:16,089
buy armed weapons people will install

1271
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:19,690
security systems in their house but they

1272
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:20,859
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget to take their medicine so</font>

1273

what am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting out here what if all</font>

1274
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:27,339
the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> CXOs were actually you guys</font>

1275
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:31,180
what if lead developers were actually

1276
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:32,710
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys what if we sent hackers into</font>

1277
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,390
the world disguised as business people

1278
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,170
and they made the hard decisions that

1279
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:40,379
avoided Armageddon well who should be do

1280
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,380
that

1281
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:50,250
you guys what do you think want to dump

1282
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,560
all this whole hacker con stuff and go

1283
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:57,000
get a business degree oh hell no

1284
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:59,970
that go forth among the heathens and

1285
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,980
speak the truth there are 18 to 24 month

1286
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:04,049
mba classes you can go from nerd<font color="#CCCCCC"> tu</font>

1287
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,330
numero uno it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the king</font>

1288
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,890
right there are multiple online

1289
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:09,390
development courses to choose from

1290
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:12,600
college and non college you can get your

1291
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:14,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">idols certification think about the</font>

1292
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:17,700
crises we can avoid if all the security

1293
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,080
people were making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decisions you</font>

1294
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,939
know there's there's courses out there

1295
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,549
that will take you four to six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

1296
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,870
see ccie or something like that but

1297
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,170
there's no courses that will do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1298
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:29,759
business guys you ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that you</font>

1299
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,970
can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> enroll in something and have</font>

1300
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,740
your MBA in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 months they don't do</font>

1301
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:38,399
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that why because they think</font>

1302
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:39,959
it's too important that's weird what do

1303
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're ready to step out of</font>

1304
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,100
your comfort zone get down to your ivory

1305
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,720
tower of security commune with the

1306
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,000
filthy masses and get your hands dirty

1307
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,620
do some good for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world you can do it</font>

1308
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,820
a lot a whole lot of effective change

1309
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:56,700
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah ready to do that you're</font>

1310
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:59,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the world if you do not</font>

1311
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:03,390
ready to do that well that's why

1312
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:07,550
security people suck and that is why you

1313
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:07,549
fail thank you guys

1314
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:17,170
yes

1315
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,530
mm-hmm

1316
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,059
yes

1317
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,560
I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you without penetration</font>

1318
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:37,230
testers there would be much more many

1319
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,500
more secure many fewer security updates

1320
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:42,300
that's very true and like i said i had

1321
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,859
two days to put this all together I need

1322
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,770
to edit my slides to say that there's

1323
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:49,140
there's yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I s and it's a valid</font>

1324
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,220
comment and I agree with you and one of

1325
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,868
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to know</font>

1326
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,279
there's no you're not going to get rid

1327
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the need for penetration testing</font>

1328
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,400
never I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys who are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

1329
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding these flaws it's very very</font>

1330
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,050
important and very necessary and

1331
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,910
penetration testing will continue as a

1332
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:05,990
practice for probably the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mankind</font>

1333
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:05,990
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

1334
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a they said the the comment was the</font>

1335
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,610
reason mba courses don't take more than

1336
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,730
12 months is because it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> stroking</font>

1337
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:27,040
the professor's ego sometimes sometimes

1338
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,040
yes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that too but</font>

1339
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,370
yeah if the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that good at</font>

1340
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">business why are they teaching in the</font>

1341
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,290
college because those who can do and

1342
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:49,120
those who can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do teach and those who</font>

1343
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:49,120
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> teach teach teachers mm-hmm</font>

1344
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,570
yes

1345
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,150
mm-hmm

1346
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,940
you

1347
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,399
that's true i mean ruffling the feathers

1348
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,200
is what it's about though<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'm</font>

1349
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,700
sitting up here talking at a security

1350
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,319
conference talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why security</font>

1351
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:36,759
people suck ruffling feathers is the way

1352
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:38,950
to get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mba well it's true</font>

1353
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,440
you don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a union card but i mean</font>

1354
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:43,390
there are debates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the times</font>

1355
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,190
about formal education and the benefits

1356
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,109
thereof and going through formal

1357
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,570
education is maddening head points i

1358
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:51,670
mean i took an accounting 101 class in

1359
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:54,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">order to get my first you know</font>

1360
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,720
information information systems degree

1361
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,100
now why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell i needed to take</font>

1362
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,689
accounting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know and I hated</font>

1363
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:01,270
every bloody goddamn minute of that

1364
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:02,500
class every friggin minute and i hated

1365
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,120
the professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he was up there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

1366
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,410
loved accounting and he was great at it

1367
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,330
and he was indians there so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1368
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,160
different question that is a wonderful

1369
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,810
question I'm so happy you asked that

1370
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:16,420
it's like a stop stop make it stop yeah

1371
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:18,160
but the point is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and deal</font>

1372
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:21,100
with the as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the glory I</font>

1373
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,470
mean you can't stick to<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you love</font>

1374
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,850
to do every stinking day you gotta do

1375
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:26,919
the I got to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> my bills I</font>

1376
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,569
hate paying bills I mean I had to take

1377
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,190
that accounting class I hate taking

1378
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:33,730
accounting classes I had to go through

1379
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:35,620
math courses that I despise so that I

1380
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:37,030
could get my master's degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

1381
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:39,250
point is you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the bad</font>

1382
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:40,900
and did the math classes help well don't

1383
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell my professor I said this but yeah</font>

1384
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:47,650
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> really did it's it that the the</font>

1385
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,760
point I heard Bruce Potter stand up

1386
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,470
there and he said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1387
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that getting a formal education is the</font>

1388
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,580
most important thing when I believe he

1389
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">really meant is you can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just get your</font>

1390
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,180
formal education sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that and say I'm</font>

1391
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:01,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">good now because I have my union card my</font>

1392
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">MBA what you need to keep the hacker</font>

1393
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:05,080
thing going on what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem why</font>

1394
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:07,299
is this not working and digging down

1395
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,740
into the lower nether regions of what

1396
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,420
the problem is and that's a good thing

1397
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:15,220
that hackers do but at the same time

1398
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,740
there are very few people i mean Bruce

1399
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">Potter's not here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok he's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only guy</font>

1400
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,549
that could put yeah he's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only guy</font>

1401
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:24,970
that can put on his resume I'm Bruce

1402
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:26,920
Potter and get a job me I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put you</font>

1403
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:30,089
know education<font color="#CCCCCC"> certification stuff like</font>

1404
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,090
that because nobody heard of me yet

1405
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,980
mm-hmm

1406
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:47,140
oh yeah there's some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here with</font>

1407
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:48,610
big egos I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because the</font>

1408
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,839
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy has a big ego doesn't mean</font>

1409
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,790
that the hacker doesn't have a big ego

1410
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,440
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other things months was</font>

1411
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:55,210
saying is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> was sitting someplace in</font>

1412
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,340
states<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can't you can't hack</font>

1413
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:58,990
into this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just can't do it</font>

1414
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,060
and they told they challenged him

1415
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,740
personally and you know he's a great guy

1416
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:04,390
I love him to death<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he's got a big</font>

1417
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,220
