28
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:58,720
the coolest things I've seen in probably

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:07,750
things like this and they need your

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,380
probably reopen it so anyway do try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

43
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,180
support them because this is exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">type of organization that needs our help</font>

45
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,840
alright so my standard thing is is that

46
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm from the south</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I drink a lot of</font>

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,359
red bull and I talk really damn fast so

48
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,769
hopefully this very tasty my hard

49
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,810
lemonade will help counteract those

50
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:49,000
effects but I also kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pee</font>

51
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,640
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know what's going to happen</font>

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm probably in the talk really fast but</font>

53
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can't understand me or you got a</font>

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,060
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stop me because I'll just</font>

55
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,450
keep on<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and going and going so</font>

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,250
please say something to me basically

57
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,048
this presentation is about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,079
websites and web applications faster

59
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,120
which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good so just a quick</font>

60
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,910
background about me you guys know who I

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,350
am I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Scott I was talking</font>

62
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,850
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier you know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not</font>

63
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily good to put on labels and</font>

64
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,299
also um who<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the gal talking about</font>

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,200
the media or media hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> busily for</font>

66
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,250
the hackerspace yeah for so

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,510
I thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a really good point</font>

68
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,860
that she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do</font>

69
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Infosecurity there are a lot of people</font>

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">who are hackers hackers hacking has</font>

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,450
nothing to do with information security

72
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,060
I gave a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> at freaknik right after I</font>

73
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,829
got sued actually and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

74
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,420
was called the process of a hack and it

75
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,730
basically says all hacking is is

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,290
critical thinking you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system you</font>

77
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,880
analyze it you break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to its</font>

78
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,880
fundamental parts and you start learning

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">how the system works and invariably you</font>

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,019
end up figuring out wait a minute there

81
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,180
are flaws in this system it it's very

82
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,010
conducive to doing security work but

83
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,680
really it's just it's higher thinking

84
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,690
its analysis and so I don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself as a security guy even though</font>

86
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,280
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing security for you know</font>

87
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,660
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 79 years now I really just</font>

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,579
think of myself as curious and that's

89
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,680
all you need to be to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good hacker</font>

90
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:15,209
it's just be curious you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,190
I have things that are shiny and things

92
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,649
I can take apart and redbull I'm a happy

93
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,000
camper so you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

94
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,849
don't worry if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do security</font>

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,229
that's not what this is about I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

96
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,930
kind of a wide interesting range of

97
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,280
experiences I walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a law office</font>

98
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,289
before with that man back there with

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,388
crazy pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> named strick who is able to</font>

100
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:35,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me great legal advice and counsel I</font>

101
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,039
used to do a lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like</font>

102
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-level hardware when I got out at</font>

103
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,770
Georgia Tech I did a lot of web hacking

104
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,130
and web analysis and pretty much in

105
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,130
october i left HP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found it in a</font>

106
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,409
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> called zoom and we specialize on</font>

107
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,580
web performance basically we find

108
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,830
problems with their website that are

109
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,650
slowing it down is the easiest way to

110
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,919
say and a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you're</font>

111
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,330
crazy why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you leaving security where</font>

112
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,460
you're fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known you've written</font>

113
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,690
books about it and going to web

114
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,880
performance web performance something

115
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:10,139
boring well hopefully as we do this talk

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,849
you realize actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of</font>

117
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,910
cool stuff about web performance it's

118
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,909
not the boring stuff you think excuse me

119
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,220
also a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff I knew about</font>

120
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,720
dealing with websites and finding sequel

121
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,820
injection and cross site scripting and

122
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,440
problems with websites ninety-five

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,510
percent of what I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was how do</font>

124
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,729
you crawl on analyze websites how do you

125
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze JavaScript how do you break</font>

126
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:35,460
apart flash and reverse engineered how

127
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,770
do you break apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> Silverlight so all of</font>

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work</font>

129
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,940
the net<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end thing you're doing is</font>

130
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:43,220
finding security problems or performance

131
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,009
problems it really doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> 95% it</font>

132
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,900
is the same so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I've started</font>

133
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:50,270
and it's been about six feet there are

134
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,138
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> six months and so far it's being</font>

135
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,359
pretty successful so why why even care

136
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,879
about performance well poor performance

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,530
cost you money um there's obviously

138
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,419
operational costs right like if your

139
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,659
website is pushing if you have your

140
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:07,849
JPEGs and you know your logo when it's

141
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:10,699
rendered on the HTML is only say 300

142
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,560
pixels by 200 pixels but it's a JPEG

143
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,330
that is two thousand pixels by a

<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand pixels you know you're pushing</font>

145
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,539
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data down the pipe that's not</font>

146
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,460
actually being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used so at the very least</font>

147
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,810
you're wasting bandwidth you start

148
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,159
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with server load you start</font>

getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> power and cooling costs</font>

150
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,159
when you do with a virtualized

151
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,190
environment I mean good<font color="#CCCCCC"> lord we've got a</font>

152
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,719
netbook back there running six VMs for

153
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,870
the hac lab right you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

154
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:34,550
like 128 Meg's or 256 Meg's of memory

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,139
allocated to these things when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

156
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,879
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> environment if you can</font>

157
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at a website and say wow you can</font>

158
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,360
make some changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then your server</font>

159
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,520
load is going to drop to seventy percent

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,780
of what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now or you don't need as</font>

161
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,818
much storage or you don't need as much

162
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,099
ram you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can take that allocate it to</font>

163
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:51,919
something else so another really great

164
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:53,870
benefit um when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

165
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,250

166
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,500
every wouldn't be excited about right

167
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,210
it's really obvious you pushed X number

168
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,460
of bytes down the pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> last month</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

170
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,198
going to push down say<font color="#CCCCCC"> eh so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

171
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,759
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend less money I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

172
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,759
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really obvious but it actually</font>

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,389
turns out that the bad user experience

174
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,650
has enormous costs so Google did some

175
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:17,659
research and they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for every</font>

188
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,980
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would abandon it and say screw</font>

191
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,300
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo found for every basically</font>

192
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,390
400 milliseconds of delay they added

193
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,270
they had nine percent of a nine percent

194
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,520

nine percent of people who just didn't

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother waiting for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pagelet they</font>

198
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,870
just lacks because it was so slow and

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,520
unresponsive now the funny thing here to

200
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,220
note is that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are big brand names</font>

201
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,740
right arguably I'd be more tolerant of

202
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,390
Amazon being slow because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> already like</font>

203
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,070
Amazon they've got a lot of products I'm

204
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,229
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with their amazon prime</font>

206
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,280
your mom and pop or you're just some

207
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,990
random company X that somebody doesn't

208

already have a loyalty to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

209
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,890
be a lot less tolerance of your site

210
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing slow then they are these guys</font>

211
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,479
being slow and it's already<font color="#CCCCCC"> causing</font>

212
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,130
these guys a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money well why why</font>

213
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,820
is that such an issue well users have

214
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,870
ridiculously high expectations

215
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,789
forty-seven percent of visitors say they

216
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,460
expect the page to load in less than two

217
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,830
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty-two percent of online</font>

218
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,410
users state that fasting loaded fast

219
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,270
loading pages are very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

220
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,949
them being loyal to a site or not so if

221
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,560
you're not fast half the people are

222
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,490
going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be involved with you</font>

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,260
there's some great stuff from this

224
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:02,750
Akamai<font color="#CCCCCC"> forth for study the basically</font>

225
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">said look slow pages forty percent of</font>

226
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,310
users will abandon a page if it takes

227
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,710
longer than three seconds to live so I

228
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,319
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually for these bottom</font>

229
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,550
three stats this was referring to

230
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecommerce sites so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I've</font>

231
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,430
already got an item<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a shopping cart</font>

232
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,170
right like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I already</font>

233
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,430
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy this linksys router that you</font>

234
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,010
flash the firmware with some cool

235
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,290
hacking stuff I'm all ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

236
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">had this is too slow I'll just leave so</font>

237
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,740
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people would</font>

238
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,450
abandon even before they started

239
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,390
checking out sixty-five percent of

240
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:35,510
people will abandon checking out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

241
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,490
 so if you have a slow site and you

242
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,770
have any type of online revenue being

243
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,680
generated from ads or be it generated

244
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,819
from stuff you sell performance really

245
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,010
really matters there's a huge

246
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,160
correlation between fast sites and

247
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:51,560
increased revenue so again just to kind

248
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,020
of summarize faster sites being more

249
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,969
visitors more

250
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,630
visitors you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more engaged</font>

251
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:01,330
user um they tend to view more pages per

252
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,860
visit so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just read this story</font>

253
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,150
you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go to iron geek</font>

254
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,390
and read you know some of the awesome

255
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:09,010
stuff that that's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted or look</font>

256
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,990
at some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool videos they tend to</font>

257
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,569
then go and view more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the site</font>

258
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,250
because it's fast and they like it you

259
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,750
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> better conversion rate so even if</font>

260
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,090
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to get people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign</font>

261
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,440
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the mailing list for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

262
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,360
hackerspace or you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

263
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,010
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to join a mailing list or</font>

264
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,720
subscribe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your RSS feed or follow you</font>

265
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,090
on twitter you tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a higher</font>

266
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,670
rate of people actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do those actions</font>

267
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:33,580
more revenue increase user satisfaction

268
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,130
and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the hardware</font>

269
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth savings we mentioned</font>

270
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,390
earlier um what's very interesting is

271
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,910
the end of last year Google kind of made

272
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,350
this they didn't really publicize it but

273
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:46,810
everybody took it and ran with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

274
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,850
there's a guy named matt cutts who kind

275
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like talks a lot for google even</font>

276
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,940
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> he does their anti-spam stuff I</font>

277
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,330
don't know he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an odd guy but</font>

278
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,160
um he kind of made this this mentioned

279
00:10:55,330 --> 00:11:00,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">in passing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is considering</font>

280
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,709
using how fast a page load as input into

281
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">PageRank so if you have two sites that</font>

282
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,730
are eat that basically are contained

283
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,900
equally good information the faster site

284
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,120
would appear higher in search engine

285
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,280
rankings and that freaked everybody out

286
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,540
so now they're really looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how</font>

287
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,680
important performances so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

288
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,660
site i'm going to walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you through how</font>

289
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,219
to make sites faster but understand that

290
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand ok what's</font>

291
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,150
involved with a website what's going on

292
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,650
what's the back end i won't bill able

293
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this too much but let's just take on</font>

294
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,199
this online store it's called via salem

295
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:36,010
and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad movies 1</font>

296
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,650
million pc is a horrible movie take my

297
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:40,870
here what's the soup with joel mchale

298
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,520
did anybody watch it last night there

299
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,550
was an original sci-fi movie that's

300
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,350
called my dinocroc and they just showed

301
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,060
a clip of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this basically who could</font>

302
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,470
have met know it was Dino shark Dino

303
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,119
shark<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically had a shark</font>

304
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the head of a Tyrannosaurus Rex</font>

305
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,560
that was like leaping out of the water

306
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and eating surfers that is a level of</font>

307
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,109
quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this movie we're just letting</font>

308
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,050
you know

309
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,760
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your quintessential store um</font>

310
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:09,160
it's it's got a mix of static<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

311
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,230
dynamic content so web pages are and web

312
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,569
apps websites are made up I<font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't use</font>

313
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:16,300
those terms interchangeably so a website

314
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,190
and a web application<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it's a</font>

315
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,490
content or service that's being

316
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,019
delivered through your<font color="#E5E5E5"> web browser so</font>

317
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,149
dynamic content is stuff that changes

318
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,339
based on inputs so you say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

319
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:29,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Scarface DVD well you know</font>

320
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:32,680
they amazon doesn't have you know two

321
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:34,600
billion pre-made pages of all their

322
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,910
products basically they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have if you</font>

323
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,860
actually consider URL you see that all

324
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the products for this page or surf</font>

325
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,160
from product<font color="#E5E5E5"> up PHP and it has ID equals</font>

326
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:47,439
138 that's a product ID so you go and

327
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,269
you look at say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dino shark which I'm</font>

328
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,690
sure will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on this side that'll be</font>

329
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">product ID you know 150 now the security</font>

330
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,160
hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Billy goes ha that's a product</font>

331
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,050
ID when they're constructing this page

332
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,990
there proudly consulting a database to

333
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,640
basically say hey pull off the picture

334
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,290
of this Tyrannosaurus Rex pull up the

335
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,240
number of items we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in stock pull up</font>

336
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the price pull up comments pull up</font>

337
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,230
reviews it's pulling all that stuff

338
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,029
dynamically out of a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally</font>

339
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">would put a tick or what equals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one in</font>

340
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:16,300
there and see whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> their sequel</font>

341
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,620
injection because I guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that</font>

342
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">number is somehow getting to the</font>

343
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,410
database dear so dynamic content changes

344
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:28,240
based on input show me product ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

345
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:29,769
show me product ID six so also static

346
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,170
content is pretty much everything else

347
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not the HTML so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

348
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,579
about a wordpress blog you know comments

349
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,190
can be changed you can edit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

350
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:41,050
show multiple posts on the same page so

351
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's another good example of dynamic</font>

352
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,069
content typically the HTML is the

353
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,500
dynamic part of the web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> but your</font>

354
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your CSS your flash your</font>

applets the fonts it has to download a

356
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,920
PDF all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff is static it's</font>

357
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,070
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been generated and it's just</font>

358
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the web server so a modern</font>

359
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,270
data or modern web app looks like this

360
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,709
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your networking devices</font>

361
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,930
would be things like your router's your

362
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,940
switches you know everything to get

363
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,469
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the web server we have</font>

364
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,720
the web server itself which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

365
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,610
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> running Apache or I is this</font>

366
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,370
basically accepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

367
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:18,040
and decides what to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if it's</font>

368
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:21,670
having to say execute code like you've

369
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,260
written it in Ruby or PHP or asp net

370
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,449
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to execute</font>

371
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,960
the code it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically says oh you're</font>

372
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,940
running the program asp<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhara products</font>

373
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,270
up the HPD we need to execute that code

374
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,550
so it interprets the PHP it token<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeses</font>

375
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:40,810
creates my code executes it basically

376
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,189
runs the logic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> generates the page</font>

377
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,900
that's what we call the applications

378
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and finally we have the database</font>

379
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,720
tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where you're actually</font>

380
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,400
pulling the information from the

381
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,710
application to your puts it all together

382
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,079
sends it to the web server which is your

383
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:56,410
liquors it through networking devices to

384
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,360
the clients browser really simple so

385
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,120
when you're serving static content when

386
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,580
I say give me CNN you know hey CNN com

387
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,610
give me your logo I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to request your</font>

388
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,650
logo what happens is the logo<font color="#CCCCCC"> an image</font>

389
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">its static it's just a file sitting on</font>

390
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,490
the web server so your request comes

391
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,619
through hits the web server the web

392
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,120
server goes oh well that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a file</font>

393
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,400
it's just a file sitting in this

394
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,360
directory called you know resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

395
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,920
logo / current<font color="#E5E5E5"> logo jpg and so it just</font>

396
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,140
serves at you it's a static file it

397
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,540
doesn't have to do anything to generate

398
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:31,480
the content to get back to you but when

399
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,730
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> say for example you visit the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amazon</font>

400
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,370
page and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the HTML / say</font>

401
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scar-faced DVD it's got to run some</font>

402
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,810
PHP or some asp net which contacts the

403
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,690
database and like we said pull down the

404
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,229
comments the reviews of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scarface pull</font>

405
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,080
down on the what's the quantity what's

406
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,850
the cost you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current you</font>

407
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,380
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> best selling item once it's item</font>

408
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,570
rank you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

409
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,990
database generate the HTML and spend it

410
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:02,410
all back to you so because I mean

411
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,410
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is less expensive than</font>

412
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:07,719
this there's more CPU resources involved

413
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,050
because it's got to do more work to

414
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,600
basically generate the page typically

415
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,810
generating in

416
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,000
gml page takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times longer than</font>

417
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:19,099
just serving it if it was a fine because

418
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the web server has to do more work so</font>

419
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,610
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that traditionally when you</font>

420
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,089
talk about web performance people say

421
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,319
let's optimize this process let's do

422
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,600
everything we can to make sure that this

423
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:34,490
is fast because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to minimize the</font>

424
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,810
discrepancy between this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

425
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,000
they do things like application

426
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,180
optimization who here has ever optimized

427
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,709
code I know you have strict so that's

428
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,839
the things like okay we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

429
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,729
this code and maybe it's nasty and<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

430
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,680
lot of if statements and while loops and

431
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:53,779
let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimize it so it can run</font>

432
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:56,000
faster when we take this PHP program and

433
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:58,490
we convert it into code the program runs

434
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,769
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer runs let's keep a cached</font>

435
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,480
copy of that so every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pages</font>

436
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">request we don't have to recompile it</font>

437
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,890
that's called caching byte codes let's

438
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:09,230
handle sessions appropriately then

439
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,360
there's this idea of application object

440
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cashin which is saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know we</font>

441
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:21,319
grabs already from the database maybe

442
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:23,299
the top 100 best selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> dvds for this</font>

443
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,849
movie and on every page we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

444
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:27,500
have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side here are the top items</font>

445
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,990
that are being sold today the top 100

446
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,400
dvds so there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> cents on every single</font>

447
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,620
page whether somebody's looking up

448
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,860
Scarface DVD or<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

449
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,629
the you know 1,000,000 bc DVD there's no

450
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,539
reason to ask the database over and over

451
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and over again for this list we know it</font>

452
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:46,789
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you also have on cashing</font>

453
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,090
proxies that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay once you've</font>

454
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:52,280
generated this HTML let's store it in

455
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,928
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next person who asks it there's no</font>

456
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,908
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to do all this calculation</font>

457
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,530
again let's do it once and then here

458
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,419
they take it kind of store cached copy

459
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,490
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next person that comes in</font>

460
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,929
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just feed the cache copy to that so</font>

461
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,169
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're trying to do things to</font>

462
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,669
produce the amount of time now what's

463
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,679
interesting is that web performance has

464
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,530
changed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see this that dynamic</font>

465
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,390
content is fast typically this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

466
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,440
amazing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can show you a diagram</font>

467
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:20,160
when you visit twitter right and

468
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,930
basically from the time lights hi

469
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,350
twitter com into my browser and click

470
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">enter it takes a third of a second 300</font>

471
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,419
milliseconds for that request to go from

472
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,950
my laptop I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even know where</font>

473
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,500
Twitter servers are let's say San Jose

474
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,930
so he goes across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet or across</font>

475
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the United States kits Twitter servers</font>

476
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,030
goes up through this stack and they go

477
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
oh Billy's requesting strikes Twitter

478
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,020
page okay well let's pull down the list

479
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,940
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> strict friends we can populate the</font>

480
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,620
list let's pull down the most recent

481
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,570
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates from strict let's put all</font>

482
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:53,820
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the database generate</font>

483
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,370
the page and travel it back across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

484
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">United States back across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the United</font>

485
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,989
States takes a third of a second that's

486
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,399
pretty amazing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what's</font>

487
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,440
happened is we've done such a good job

488
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,560
with these basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end</font>

489
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,150
optimizations parade we won like it and

490
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,649
that's when you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about web</font>

491
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,390
performance so like that's boring it's a

492
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,830
solved problem you either throw more

493
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,720
hardware at the problem or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use</font>

494
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,429
object caching or use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of these</font>

495
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,650
programs like memcache<font color="#CCCCCC"> ste to help you</font>

496
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,140
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is is that that's not the</font>

497
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">limiting factor anymore it's all this</font>

498
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,220
other static content which we'll see in

499
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,650
just a second typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a website if</font>

500
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,360
you go to cnn.com the first page

501
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,510
basically the only part of cnn.com

502
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,370
that's dynamic is the HTML everything

503
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,950
else the images the little thumbnails of

504
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,479
all the stories the CSS so it can render

505
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,580
all the pretty colors all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that crap</font>

506
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,860
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

507
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,720
content has to download CNN actually we

508
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:52,830
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at this right now so at</font>

509
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,560
CNN com and there's a there's an awesome

510
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,870
firefox plugin that's called view

511
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,760
dependencies and if this thing ever

512
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,399
comes up it's going to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell</font>

513
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,430
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that here doing a lot of</font>

514
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,870
transferring<font color="#CCCCCC"> umm it'll tell me all the</font>

515
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:12,500
crap that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> download we're</font>

516
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to right here view page info</font>

517
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:19,140
dependencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so here is the</font>

518
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,580
HTML but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the total size of CNN is 830</font>

519
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,940
4k of that the HTML page right here is

520
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,539
23 k all of the images that downloaded

521
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,999
were set

522
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,220
100k here's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> all day it downloaded</font>

523
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:37,470
17<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript files all of those are</font>

524
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,239
static it downloaded do 25 images all of

525
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,549
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are static it downloaded some</font>

526
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,820
other images and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other posts</font>

527
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:48,149
some more scripts<font color="#CCCCCC"> and background images</font>

528
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">in flash so you're talking you know only</font>

529
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:52,559
five percent of the page is this dynamic

530
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,209
stuff and so what we found is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,639
optimized websites and make them a lot

532
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,979
faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you focus on somehow making</font>

533
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:01,769
this static stuff faster you get huge

534
00:20:58,979 --> 00:21:04,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance returns and that's basically</font>

535
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:05,489
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be talking about so to</font>

536
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,739
understand that you need to see how a

537
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:09,659
web page loads so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's called</font>

538
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:11,909
a waterfall graph this is actually

539
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:14,099
pretty easy to understand basically this

540
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:16,139
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> your browser does when it's</font>

541
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:18,210
trying to render say CNN com or in this

542
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:20,879
case it's rendering the<font color="#CCCCCC"> homepage of zoom</font>

543
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,200
which is the website that we have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

544
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:26,459
visiting a page zoom calm / case studies

545
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,739
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing my browser has to do</font>

546
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,690
is first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all has to do with DNS</font>

547
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,609
lookup it's got to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's the IP</font>

548
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,549
address of that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> part is</font>

549
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:38,070
right here takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 150 milliseconds</font>

550
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:41,279
this is a 200 milliseconds for two

551
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,590
milliseconds so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it first does a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

552
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,029
lookup these orange that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

553
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,590
connection it has to go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do a</font>

554
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:50,429
three-way handshake say i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

555
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,488
downloading data this green part is my

556
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:56,970
browser making a request it says hey you

557
00:21:53,489 --> 00:22:00,509
know zoom<font color="#E5E5E5"> com get me the vial case</font>

558
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,099
studies not PHP now it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it making</font>

559
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and the green part is it's</font>

560
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:05,789
waiting it's waiting until it this is

561
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,830
what's called the time to first byte

562
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:11,009
I've made the request and now i'm

563
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:13,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">waiting for the response and the blue</font>

564
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:16,289
part isn't actually downloaded so we see

565
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:18,139
that for means it gets all of the HTML

566
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the first page takes half a second</font>

567
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:24,658
now everything here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all that other</font>

568
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,100
crap we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about style sheet</font>

572
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,470
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that other crap so even if</font>

573
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,750
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> double the speed that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back end</font>

574
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,610
stuff worked at we would go from you

575
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,250
know 500 milliseconds to 250

576
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,159
milliseconds but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we have the speed of</font>

577
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,140
this you're talking seconds so that's

578
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:53,010
why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to focus on what can we do to</font>

579
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">make this part faster to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you an</font>

580
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:00,210
idea this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cnn's waterfall looks</font>

581
00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:04,020
like that little piece right there is it

582
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading the html5 this is all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that other</font>

583
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,480
crap so now do you see why optimizing

584
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:13,408
all of this other crap is where we

585
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">should focus our attention on exactly so</font>

586
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:17,309
there's really only two rules of web

587
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,679
performance that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

588
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:21,658
you either need to reduce the size of

589
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,370
what you're sending to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients to</font>

590
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the web browser you know don't send so</font>

591
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:28,320
much data you know the fact that CNN is

592
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">800k to visit the main page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of CNN</font>

593
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,939
that's ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's huge that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

594
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:36,510
lot of data so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to reduce the</font>

595
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,370
size<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the response size or you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

596
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,960
produce the number of trace and we'll go

597
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">into that second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one in a minute but the</font>

598
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,830
first one should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty obvious if</font>

599
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,039
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to send you a lot of data</font>

600
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,360
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be faster so I don't want</font>

601
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,530
to stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in lecture and show you</font>

602
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,750
slides and stuff because that's kind of

603
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,850
boring I'd rather do live performance

604
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,559
autopsies so what I'm going to do is I'm

605
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,668
just we're to look at live sites we're

606
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,840
gonna look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at live sites i'm going to</font>

607
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,860
walk you through<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're doing</font>

608
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,510
that's wrong so the first rule is of

609
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,600
course you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce response size</font>

610
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,700
so has anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever wondered in the</font>

611
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,219
grocery store or why orange juice from

612
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,370
concentrate is so cheap and like

613
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,710
Tropicana is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so expensive they're not</font>

614
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,780
shipping water exactly it's a hell of a

615
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot cheaper to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ship powder than ship</font>

616
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,799
powder that's inside a blogger so what

617
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,379
happens is when you buy like you know

618
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">public's brand you know orange juice</font>

619
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,130
that says made from concentrate what

620
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,360
happens is is that you know they sent

621
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:34,260
you know the low

622
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,449
ol distributor maybe an Atlanta they

623
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,070
sent them a bunch of powder and then for

624
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,900
all the Atlanta Public stores they just

625
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,280
add the water once you're inside the

626
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,170
state of Georgia<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they ship that</font>

627
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,870
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few you know dozens of</font>

628
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:48,180
miles to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the store as opposed to sending</font>

629
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,340
you know fresh-squeezed orange juice

630
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,230
from Florida hundreds of miles it's

631
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,300
cheaper it's smaller and it's faster

632
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,290
it's the exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> same idea what we're</font>

633
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,090
going to be doing we're going to say

634
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,460
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do to make</font>

635
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">these this data that we have to send how</font>

636
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,690
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make it smaller now obviously if</font>

637
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,939
you guys ever think about pictures you

638
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,160
can have really high resolution pictures

639
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,680
really you know nice pretty pictures

640
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,120
that have lots of fidelity you know

641
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,220
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five thousand pixels by</font>

642
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,570
five thousand pixels but what we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

643
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

644
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,919
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> reducing quality you know obviously</font>

645
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,990
the cheapest thing would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> for CNN to</font>

646
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,410
do is turn off images just you know go

647
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,720
back to you know 1992 and the image<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag</font>

648
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,210
doesn't even exist that's right and

649
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,410
you're freaking browsing by tell netting

650
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:37,530
to port 80 which is actually

651
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,760
unbelievable amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun I think my</font>

652
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,940
definition of fun is radically different

653
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">than most people's so that's what we're</font>

654
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,970
going to be doing we're going to say

655
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:47,429
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got rid</font>

656
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,720
of crap everything would be faster but

657
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,280
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a middle</font>

658
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,860
ground we're going to say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

659
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,870
do to reduce the size without reducing

660
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,199
quality we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically going to be</font>

661
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,120
looking for lossless optimizations so

662
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,860
let's i'm just going to browse around

663
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:09,719
oreilly com because they're kind of fun

664
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:11,790
to pick on and I know whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

665
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,990
whenever I see people having a web

666
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:14,610
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out what</font>

667
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,160
plugins they have so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just tell you</font>

668
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,929
I have a plug-in called a<font color="#E5E5E5"> block row</font>

669
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,370
which is obviously awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

670
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">plug-in called Firebug which lets you</font>

671
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,929
debug the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DOM and everything I have a</font>

672
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,860
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in called why slow which</font>

673
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,720
actually helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> to analyze the</font>

674
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,729
performance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a page I have a plug-in</font>

675
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,370
called dust me selectors which basically

676
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,440
says what CSS rules for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website are</font>

677
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,209
being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the web developer</font>

678
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,679
toolbar which is freaking amazing and

679
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,720
will be

680
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,129
that quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also that this is</font>

681
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,139
really great this plumbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here</font>

682
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:43,519
cold color picker basically I come<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

683
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,860
here and I'm like hey what's the color

684
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,539
of this red and then you can come down

685
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like would you like me to</font>

686
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,710
copy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you know a hex number</font>

687
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,149
or an RGB or you know whatever you want

688
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it makes it really handy when</font>

689
00:26:53,149 --> 00:26:59,029
you're developing sites so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

690
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:01,580
Riley's page<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no nothing much going</font>

691
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:03,139
on it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of interesting um we want</font>

692
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,460
to find out how to make this page

693
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:06,590
smaller so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing you have to</font>

694
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,220
do is look at what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source of the</font>

695
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:14,090
page so can you all see that I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bump</font>

696
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:18,889
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size good excellent all right so</font>

697
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:21,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh I went to the end there we go okay so</font>

698
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:23,719
this is the HTML this is what makes up

699
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:26,480
the page so you know this looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

700
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,240
interesting we see links to style sheets

701
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,249
we see links to<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript files that we</font>

702
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,289
come down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we see they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

703
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,879
HTML comments this is interesting these

704
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:37,220
look like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe debugging</font>

705
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:39,049
comments I don't know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a load</font>

706
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,659
balancer I mean they have a lot of stuff

707
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">in here they've got some JavaScript so</font>

708
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,139
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to figure out how we can</font>

709
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,240
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this smaller well the first thing</font>

710
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:51,459
I'm going to do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

711
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:53,809
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these static files and CSS</font>

712
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,940
cascading style<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheet is a static file</font>

713
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:57,559
let me see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah here's some stuff</font>

714
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,230
but it's got all sorts of stuff in it

715
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,149
right like then we go all the way to the

716
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">top it's got you know comments like</font>

717
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:07,850
general body general settings great I

718
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,769
don't care you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know um you know this</font>

719
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was a pre actually see that there's</font>

720
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:13,759
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> for IE which doesn't obey blah</font>

721
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,350
blah blah so they've got comments

722
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">they've got white space they've got all</font>

723
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:23,019
sorts of crap it here now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it</font>

724
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really easy for me to read but that's</font>

725
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:28,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">silly what we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is minify like</font>

726
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,619
CSS and<font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and HTML there's</font>

727
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,210
human readable right they've got you

728
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:33,619
know white space in them and comments

729
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,360
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and pretty format and</font>

730
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,889
see how it had the indenting it was

731
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,479
really easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read but you know</font>

732
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,279
ninety-nine point nine nine nine nine

733
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,379
nine percent of users never look at them

734
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,269
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all or that little you know one</font>

735
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:45,469
millionth of a percent that looks at

736
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:46,669
them because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great way</font>

737
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,230
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to break in websites</font>

738
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:51,240
is by looking at the core so

739
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,950
if there's no need for these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

740
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">be human readable why don't we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

741
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,030
remove all the human stuff like the

742
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,740
browser doesn't care whether there's

743
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,500
white space<font color="#E5E5E5"> in comments it just ignores</font>

744
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,150
it and since humans aren't looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

745
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,640
why do we care let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove the</font>

746
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">white space and comments so we go from</font>

747
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have you</font>

748
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,840
know nice and and stuff like that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

749
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,809
removed all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the white space and you've</font>

750
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,370
removed all the comments so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

751
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,629
data does that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you're getting</font>

752
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,280
rid of bytes that don't need to be said

753
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,740
well that reduces 18 per second so all

754
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,360
of the CSS on oreilly com if they just

755
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,400
got rid of spaces in white space it

756
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be eighteen percent smaller which</font>

757
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:35,100
ended up being something like 15k so

758
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,440
their total page size<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was the</font>

759
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,110
neighborhood about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 150 with all the</font>

760
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,030
resources so just doing that would save

761
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,740
them ten percent of the total amount of

762
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,090
data they're pushing down one

763
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,270
optimization you just dropped your

764
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,090
bandwidth by ten percent that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

765
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,490
awesome right let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else we can</font>

766
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,439
do now of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't just apply</font>

767
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,760
to CSS right we also talked about

768
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">javascript so let's see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

769
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,559
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their javascript OOP let's go</font>

770
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,270
back up to the top so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I scroll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font>

771
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,639
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this thing you know arriving</font>

772
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,460
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> engine day s let's look at it same</font>

773
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,440
thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they've got comments a</font>

774
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,720
lot of white spaces it's nice and pretty

775
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,070
to read there's no reason for that to be

776
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,820
there let's remove that white space

777
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:22,860
you'd also save a space and time but

778
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,770
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not only can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just do</font>

779
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,290
this to javascript in CSS you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

780
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do at HTML so all this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

781
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:36,168
we're seeing um if we look here let's go

782
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,899
back

783
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,039
you know all these like there's a block

784
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,168
of code where they used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

785
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,029
referencing this file comment up jas but

786
00:30:42,169 --> 00:30:45,230
they don't use it anymore there's all

787
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:47,419
this stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're actually</font>

788
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessing here there's white space that</font>

789
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:50,840
makes it look pretty you know a nice if

790
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:53,299
they remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh also here's the funny</font>

791
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,220
thing they have inside of an HTML

792
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,418
document you can have inline style data

793
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,249
so instead of putting this style

794
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,350
information in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> external file they</font>

795
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:02,299
just included it here so the same way we

796
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,939
took an external file CSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> am and</font>

797
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:08,168
minified it<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's minify the chunks of</font>

798
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:13,850
CSS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are inside the HTML document so</font>

799
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:16,429
how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> could that save you well it</font>

800
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:19,389
would save them<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost twelve percent so</font>

801
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:22,759
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of this page is</font>

802
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,949
they like just removing white space and

803
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:26,570
the funny thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that this remember</font>

804
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,489
this is a programmatically generated

805
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:30,499
page right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the HTML I</font>

806
00:31:28,489 --> 00:31:32,210
visited<font color="#E5E5E5"> the applications here there's no</font>

807
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:34,039
reason you couldn't have in your PHP

808
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,049
logic as its building this page to

809
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:37,309
remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the spaces for you I mean</font>

810
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:38,779
you're literally you're pushing bites

811
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:42,440
down the pipe that you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

812
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:43,850
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's kind of silly now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

813
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there's some other stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

814
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,899
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to pull out a little tool</font>

815
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,100
here this is just basically an HTTP

816
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:50,418
editor there are some other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

817
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,340
guys in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I can't change the</font>

818
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:56,869
fonts on this I apologize but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

819
00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to visit oreilly com and I'm</font>

820
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:05,019
going to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them that I can accept</font>

821
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:07,399
this page compressed Riley<font color="#E5E5E5"> com</font>

822
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:09,769
accept-encoding so I'm basically telling

823
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:12,469
them hey give me this page and I support

824
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:13,970
compression probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna work so I</font>

825
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,619
get the response back and nobody's ever

826
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,840
looked at HTTP this is what looked like

827
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:20,928
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically there's there's nothing</font>

828
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,619
here that says um content it actually

829
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:26,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's transfer our notes content encoding</font>

830
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">geez it basically there's this thing</font>

831
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:31,269
called HTTP compression does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

832
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:34,609
here ever heard of HTTP compression

833
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:36,109
awesome good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can't sometimes I</font>

834
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:38,119
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficulty telling where people are</font>

835
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:39,379
technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like I'm teaching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

836
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,389
early basic stuff that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know</font>

837
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:42,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just pisses them off more and so</font>

838
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:43,409
they don't say anything which makes me

839
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:45,810
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

840
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:50,220
so I get more basic what pisses them off

841
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:52,470
more it's just it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> disparar cycle all</font>

842
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so HTTP compression this is God's</font>

843
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,570
gift to the internet because basically

844
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,340
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of taking a page and pushing</font>

845
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,200
that entire page now this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

846
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,179
like dehydrating food before you send it

847
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,280
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> space right we're going to take this</font>

848
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,530
page crunch it send<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small thing and</font>

849
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">then rehydrate it on the other side now</font>

850
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,780
a lot of people say wait a minute the

851
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,640
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this other</font>

852
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,040
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> this being smaller is this big</font>

853
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,770
thing here I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to on my server or</font>

854
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,260
spend resources to compress it and then

855
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,300
my visitors have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend resources</font>

856
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,360
uncompressing it the thing is is that

857
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:29,280
computers operate you measure operations

858
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,929
in nanoseconds whereas when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

859
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,600
dealing with networks you're measuring

860
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:38,570
things in milliseconds in terms of delay

861
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:41,399
so these infinitesimal almost not even

862
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,340
detectable amount of energy it takes to

863
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,590
compress this and send it you get way

864
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:51,750
what I mean like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs you say you</font>

865
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:54,629
know two microseconds right but doing

866
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,310
this saved you<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 milliseconds it</font>

867
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:58,140
doesn't matter so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end it's</font>

868
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,629
actually a net you you should always do

869
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,880
HTTP compression and all modern web

870
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,590
servers they don't if you request the

871
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> javascript file or whatever</font>

872
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,120
compressed they don't keep recompress it

873
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,889
they compress it once and save the cache

874
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,080
copy so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time they get a request</font>

875
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,210
they don't have to keep redoing it so

876
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,040
everybody should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing come I mean</font>

877
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,690
there's no reason not to do this the

878
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,880
frightening thing is is that seventy

879
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:25,800
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the alexia top 100 only</font>

880
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,840
seventy percent or only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty percent</font>

881
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,030
of them are using gzip seventy percent

882
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,370
of the top sites on the internet are not

883
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,470
doing this if they turn this on they

884
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,529
would say you know upwards of seventy

885
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:40,020
percent immediately the thing is is that

886
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:42,120
it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> formerly part of HTTP for over</font>

887
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,800
13 years informally it's been around

888
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,620
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much since Netscape enterprise</font>

889
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,870
server to every web browser supports it

890
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,489
your BlackBerry your iPhone supports its

891
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:53,100
there's no reason not to do this it's

892
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">just stupid now so how much would arrive</font>

893
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:58,299
Issei they would save

894
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,130
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6% their main page right now so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

895
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,400
miscalculated their main page right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

896
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:05,410
I checked all they're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources</font>

897
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,370
all the CSS all the JavaScript pads a

898
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:11,529
download it was 254 k if they just made

899
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:14,589
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-line change to their apache config</font>

900
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:16,480
they would say seventy-six percent so

901
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:18,490
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like stupid basic</font>

902
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,140
stuff like why<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't you do this but</font>

903
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,049
you'd be amazed at how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't</font>

904
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,210
so HTTP compression can save you upwards

905
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:30,250
of seventy percent just instantaneous

906
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:32,020
bonus so there's another interesting

907
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,240
thing here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't necessarily show</font>

908
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:38,140
it which is crunching images who here

909
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,339
has ever heard of exif data awesome

910
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,930
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know it sticks all the</font>

911
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:42,490
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your camera well the</font>

912
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,140
thing is there's a lot of other crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

913
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,169
an image<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has nothing to do with the</font>

914
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,980
image so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

915
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:53,530
rose and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose has 5000 colors in</font>

916
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,990
the image now there might be a palette

917
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:59,320
which is saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

918
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">palette entry one is this color of red</font>

919
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,000
blue and green and then in the image

920
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,009
data it says pixel at<font color="#CCCCCC"> XY uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> palette</font>

921
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,960
entry whatever a lot of times you will

922
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,060
have more entries in the palate than

923
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,010
there actually used by the image so this

924
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just extra crap those those images</font>

925
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,630
those colors that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined or never</font>

926
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:19,299
used so if you just remove them you can

927
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:22,270
reduce the size comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> Photoshop</font>

928
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,790
actually embeds a thumbnail of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> image</font>

929
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,020
or editing inside the image<font color="#CCCCCC"> Virgil gave</font>

930
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really funny talk a couple of years</font>

931
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this gal named</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kat Schwartz</font>

932
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,799
who took some rather in a racy photos of

933
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,810
herself that were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cropped well</font>

934
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,510
the uncropped version of the photo was

935
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,650
inside the photo so she basically posted

936
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,410
naked pictures of herself to the

937
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,360
internet without realizing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> um photo</font>

938
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:44,640
data oh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Photoshop not only do</font>

939
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,990
they stick thumbnails in but it'll take

940
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about color spaces and</font>

941
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:52,209
sometimes even<font color="#E5E5E5"> um undo data so there's</font>

942
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,770
all sorts of crap in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> images that</font>

943
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,600
has nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with drawing the image</font>

944
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,860
and you can remove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have to</font>

945
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,110
stress we're not changing the image

946
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,640
quality you still have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

947
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,380
colors you still have the same

948
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,060
dimensions it's still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same quality</font>

949
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,190
nothing's blurred you're just removing

950
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,349
crap that's unneeded O'Reilly would say

951
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,089
twenty-seven percent all of their images

952
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:12,829
basically this is waste data they're

953
00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:14,839
pushing this crap down the pipe and they

954
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:16,849
don't needs it so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> by crunching your</font>

955
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,380
images so how do you do that there's a

956
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,589
really great program well there are

957
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:24,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">several that are free the best thing to</font>

958
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:26,328
do is go to a website called<font color="#E5E5E5"> smush</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

959
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:28,069
sub smush it yah boo runs it but

960
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:30,020
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can upload an image and</font>

961
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:32,029
they'll give you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crunched version of</font>

962
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,500
the image you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can upload a zip file full</font>

963
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,480
of images<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they'll crunch all of them</font>

964
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,740
and give you a zip file back so it's a

965
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,349
web service that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does all of this for</font>

966
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:43,549
you automatically in it's free so you

967
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,750
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> save quite a bit of purport you can</font>

968
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:50,020
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit by just</font>

969
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">crunching images oh yeah</font>

970
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,960
yes no no we get stripped<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because</font>

971
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,970
that stuff is stored<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the EXIF header</font>

972
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so yeah you can strip that stuff out</font>

973
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">too good quite and for security reason</font>

974
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:13,619
and privacy you should be stripping that

975
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:13,618
yeah that's twenty-seven percent

976
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:22,660
twenty-seven percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you the</font>

977
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:25,480
exit so here all due to do so I've got a

978
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,828
lovely tool that actually spits out that

979
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:32,589
basically automates a lot of this and i

980
00:38:26,829 --> 00:38:39,759
was looking at o'reilly earlier let me

981
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:41,078
go here code<font color="#E5E5E5"> for mints nope not there no</font>

982
00:38:39,759 --> 00:38:48,599
actually touch this where it is all

983
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:48,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here we go reports o'reilly</font>

984
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:58,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so really simple and I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fill</font>

985
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:07,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that column ok so you want real world</font>

986
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:11,500
examples all right those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay great</font>

987
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:14,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">so do like this image right here let's</font>

988
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:21,960
go take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that images it's</font>

989
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:21,960
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gift so that image right there it is</font>

990
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:27,880
14.3 eight percent bigger than it needs

991
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,500
to be it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little over 6k if you</font>

992
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,600
would simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> convert it to a ping image</font>

993
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:36,190
it would be a 5.7<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that's a</font>

994
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,610
savings of fourteen percent we actually

995
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do and actually here we see the gzip</font>

996
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:45,990
savings we are which averaged out to be

997
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,859
the seventy-six percent we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

998
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,750
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here because pings</font>

999
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,090
actually get really good when you crush

1000
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,010
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so pink rush this image</font>

1001
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:56,410
right here this facebook image this is

1002
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,670
kind of silly because we'll talk about

1003
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,370
this one in a second all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1004
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,790
facebook image not very big a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16</font>

1005
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:08,380
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 what you don't add me to Facebook</font>

1006
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:10,240
it is due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1300 bites if</font>

1007
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,400
you pain crunch it it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduced</font>

1008
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,669
to 198 bucks that's a savings of

1009
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,650
eighty-five percent so yes there is a

1010
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,430
yeah there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of savings so the</font>

1011
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:23,320
aggregate for O'Reilly if you take all

1012
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the images be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them jpg or ping or</font>

1013
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,990
whatever do the aggregate is total they

1014
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,390
would say twenty seven point seven

1015
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,490
percent so they're basically pushing

1016
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,910
crap they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to push yes with</font>

1017
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,910
that question

1018
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:46,430
ah good question so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few open</font>

1019
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,430
source projects that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this the</font>

1020
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:51,440
problem is is that to run these you

1021
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,960
typically want to do this in fact right

1022
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not like it only takes a</font>

1023
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,340
tenth of a second to crunch an image it

1024
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually becomes well at least with</font>

1025
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">pings they try to manipulate different</font>

1026
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,320
parts of the deflate compression

1027
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:06,050
algorithm and so it can take anywhere

1028
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,490
from depends obviously on your box and

1029
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether it's you know dual or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quad-core</font>

1030
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">but you know you can it can take</font>

1031
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,440
anywhere from a half a second to five

1032
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,520
seconds so you don't want to do this on

1033
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,130
demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the last thing you want</font>

1034
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,580
to do is take three seconds to save<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200</font>

1035
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,900
bucks so we I actually have I can put

1036
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,160
you guys to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources some people</font>

1037
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,810
have written some perl scripts that you

1038
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,120
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just point at your web root is we</font>

1039
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,560
set up a cron job and it'll go ahead and

1040
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,480
crunch the stuff automatically for you

1041
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,650
at midnight and so if you upload new

1042
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,390
stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to worry about that</font>

1043
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:38,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean you can modify to do that so I</font>

1044
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,490
didn't write<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so but yeah it's this is</font>

1045
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,770
a good exactly we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

1046
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,450
later but a lot of these optimizations

1047
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,040
you bring up a good point you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1048
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,600
incorporate them into a process you

1049
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,160
don't want to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I edited his image</font>

1050
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,540
wait did I crunch it you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

1051
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,270
something that's automatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does</font>

1052
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,350
this for you I actually suggest that how

1053
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:56,360
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here actually develop</font>

1054
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,950
websites or write websites or to edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1055
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so how many of you and it's the</font>

1056
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,000
HTML or the PHP or your strict it's

1057
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,860
tickle but he's awesome in old school

1058
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,040
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you edit the live server</font>

1059
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:09,500
like with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tico wow that's very scary I</font>

1060
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,509
don't want to use your site free with

1061
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,220
frames awesome is there is there a guy

1062
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:16,580
shoveling and it says under construction

1063
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:18,709
though oh man thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> God for Jason Scott</font>

1064
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,779
for archiv geo city so I could show<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1065
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,730
kids one point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and day like yes people</font>

1066
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:26,990
used to think purple text on a black

1067
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:30,020
animated background with a good idea of

1068
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:32,240
course to see that today<font color="#E5E5E5"> like like face</font>

1069
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,240
exactly facebook and myspace is the new

1070
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">geocities i love it um but you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1071
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,870
have a process right how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you</font>

1072
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,759
have like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a development system</font>

1073
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:44,120
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably have TP this stuff</font>

1074
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,670
or hopefully secure ftp your web stuff

1075
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:51,549
to your production server please tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1076
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:55,100
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of local Boston</font>

1077
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:56,420
all right it's a it's uh I mean I'm not

1078
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,630
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kick anybody in the nuts here</font>

1079
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,690
but it it blows my mind how we've had

1080
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:06,200
five decades of how to develop software

1081
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,730
in terms of quality testing and code

1082
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,379
review and all sorts of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1083
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,060
we have what development which does none

1084
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,770
of that we're the guys like hobo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

1085
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:16,460
fix out like literally I have seen

1086
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:20,300
somebody SSH into a web server from

1087
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,850
their phone and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> pico to change PHP</font>

1088
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,640
on a banking application that's used by

1089
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:29,330
millions of people today and then they

1090
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,520
forgot a semicolon minutes the site was

1091
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:38,420
just returning PHP errors and warnings

1092
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,820
it's it's no I can't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya sorry so</font>

1093
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,140
you want to have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Scott's</font>

1094
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,120
gonna make see I get off<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these</font>

1095
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,819
tangents and that why it takes 95

1096
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking minutes for me to talk okay so</font>

1097
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:53,510
i can leave now the eyes<font color="#E5E5E5"> walkie time</font>

1098
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:56,259
just we know drinking laughs so you can

1099
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,790
go as long as you want Billy all night I

1100
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,890
don't normally do actually I don't

1101
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">normally get complaints about back but I</font>

1102
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,500
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a problem you something out</font>

1103
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:08,690
by 830am yes back to it good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

1104
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,300
so you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a process step right</font>

1105
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,860
like idea what you have a script call it

1106
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">your publishing script that basically</font>

1107
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,580
you run this program and it should

1108
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,920
crunch your images for you it should

1109
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,049
minify your CSS and JavaScript cuz the

1110
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,280
last thing you want right like to go

1111
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:27,040
back as a web developer yeah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1112
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">motor is going to go on</font>

1113
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,650
with that like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1114
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,480
edit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the same</font>

1115
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,190
what you want to do is have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

1116
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">code provisioning system and you want to</font>

1117
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:38,870
have that in your source camera and then

1118
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,580
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do is when you push this to</font>

1119
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:43,400
your about some server you run a program

1120
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:46,549
that copies this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff applies the</font>

1121
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,800
optimizations for you and hopefully uses

1122
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,050
secure you know secure copy to actually

1123
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,670
push this to your live site that way you

1124
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:55,160
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is repeatable and</font>

1125
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:57,260
consistent because that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually will</font>

1126
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,359
I can tell you some horror stories later

1127
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,890
the worst part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when people not so</font>

1128
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,450
much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's lossless</font>

1129
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and easy and okay you forgot to crunch</font>

1130
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">some CS that's not so bad but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1131
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,310
start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into like caching and</font>

1132
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,050
other stuff like that if you have

1133
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:10,490
somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ran always decides to</font>

1134
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,010
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing certain performance things</font>

1135
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:23,359
and it doesn't tell anybody it really

1136
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:25,160
causes problems so but here's the thing

1137
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,500
it's not changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your code none of this</font>

1138
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">is program code your CSS okay arguably</font>

1139
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,790
your CSS is program code which we're

1140
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:33,410
moving it it's removing white space<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1141
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:35,330
comments though and actually you can use

1142
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:38,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">j/s min to prove that it doesn't modify</font>

1143
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:40,279
your code like it's it's it's not

1144
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,840
changing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly the ones we have</font>

1145
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,700
now right if you write your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> god help</font>

1146
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody who's written tokenizer</font>

1147
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Xand parsers and abstract syntax tree</font>

1148
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,830
creators like that's a huge pain in the

1149
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,960
ass use something that somebody already

1150
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,430
developed but you know you should have

1151
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,500
no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone crunching your</font>

1152
00:45:52,430 --> 00:46:00,049
images or somebody removing white space

1153
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:02,840
from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> jas all right so that would</font>

1154
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,610
save a Riley quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there's</font>

1155
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,370
also there's also this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of funny</font>

1156
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:10,790
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crap in JS files</font>

1157
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:12,589
I'd like to show you actually I wrote

1158
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">down a list of like funny sites that are</font>

1159
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:17,530
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stupid things that I</font>

1160
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,529
thought we took ridicule down together

1161
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:23,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about white space</font>

1162
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,999
right and white space being crazy and

1163
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:28,880
commented out HTML let's take a look

1164
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:32,569
this was just cracking me up<font color="#CCCCCC"> should you</font>

1165
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:40,519
do we'll stick it in so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1166
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:44,229
look that sounded that's a bit dirty yes

1167
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:44,229
all right let's look at best buy

1168
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,350
that's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty five second delay</font>

1169
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,850
well what's the promise that's going

1170
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:59,460
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little net bak in that book</font>

1171
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,589
which is running six VMS and it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1172
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">evdo connection all right we only care</font>

1173
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:30,660
about the source we're still alive we

1174
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:32,610
got the board stop this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a geek</font>

1175
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:37,470
squad right look where are ya Bob over

1176
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:40,920
here I get to go to hear we're actually

1177
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:43,740
in the body now so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's crap</font>

1178
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:47,640
loads of just the junk unnecessary

1179
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:54,240
unnecessary jumping so lots of HTML crap

1180
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:56,370
um so this is kind of funny um<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

1181
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back so there's also some interesting</font>

1182
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:02,870
things um let me look at a Riley

1183
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:02,870
actually I'll do

1184
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:14,549
ah good point so it's remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1185
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,380
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it necessary the operational cost</font>

1186
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,020
savings aren't so important but it's the

1187
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:22,170
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience I had to download</font>

1188
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:24,900
instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like downloading 64k to</font>

1189
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,930
render the<font color="#CCCCCC"> page i downloaded 256k go</font>

1190
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,460
through the user not exactly it saves

1191
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,930
money too<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that brings up a really</font>

1192
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:32,790
good point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a flaw on my</font>

1193
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">original logic is that oh man I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1194
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,850
saved you seventy percent of bandwidth I

1195
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:39,890
don't give a damn i have an unlimited

1196
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,890
bandwidth from my hosting provider right

1197
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:49,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay he's busy is he busy I don't think</font>

1198
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't think I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the answer</font>

1199
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that question actually yes um alright</font>

1200
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna let this sucker run in the</font>

1201
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,950
background so we kind of wrote some

1202
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,990
software to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1203
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:04,370
optimization stuff for it so I'm just

1204
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:06,959
going that put some restrictions in it

1205
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:08,250
so right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and yell aren't going to</font>

1206
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,870
be able to see the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so on a</font>

1207
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reilly here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bunch of issues that</font>

1208
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:13,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">our tool found that's having problems</font>

1209
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:17,120
with it and so some of the stuff I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1210
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:20,070
to point out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it too big</font>

1211
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:22,650
unnecessary table so a lot of times

1212
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:24,330
people will use table based layout

1213
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,620
instead of CSS<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will use tables to</font>

1214
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,150
lay out their page that adds a

1215
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,790
tremendous amount of bolt to the page

1216
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,620
now it's not just tables who wants to

1217
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:36,270
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> on no starch I love no starch but</font>

1218
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:42,120
let's kick them in the nuts so where did

1219
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:43,530
no starch good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well we can</font>

1220
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,160
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the inner zone page believe</font>

1221
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:49,080
that a minute all right right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so no</font>

1222
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,450
starch so here's something interesting

1223
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,220
that no starch you're doing we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1224
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,230
it's got kind of like a nice laid out

1225
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,540
page everything's cool let's look at the

1226
00:49:55,230 --> 00:50:01,290
source what's going on under here tables

1227
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:03,180
tables everywhere lots of uncommented

1228
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:06,450
out apparently they don't offer the list

1229
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,100
the land of<font color="#CCCCCC"> list book anymore or you</font>

1230
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">know so they've got met a bunch of</font>

1231
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,520
commented out stuff that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1232
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,060
being used they're using table this one

1233
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,220
boggles my mind um if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> down at</font>

1234
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,900
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the page I'm going to go</font>

1235
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:23,430
this is why Allah<font color="#E5E5E5"> firebug inspect</font>

1236
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:25,080
element I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has a used</font>

1237
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:27,480
to have oh yes it does that's also

1238
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,700
increase oh it's it not going to

1239
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,170
increase the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that downside no</font>

1240
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:39,439
doesn't show the end of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1241
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:42,180
basically this whole thing is a table

1242
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,430
why it's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of books next to each</font>

1243
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,750
other why is that a table but it is he's

1244
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:50,730
actually using a table and then each

1245
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:52,650
book is a is another table cell I mean

1246
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:54,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a table with a single row and</font>

1247
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,540
you know one two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font>

1248
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:59,369
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight sounds so obviously this is</font>

1249
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:01,529
a lot of just jump markup if you

1250
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:04,320
converted this from a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a CSS you</font>

1251
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,510
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably save quite a lot so it's</font>

1252
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,310
more difficult to quantify those types

1253
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,540
of changes because you don't know you

1254
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:10,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you can take away but you</font>

1255
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,930
don't know what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to add to give</font>

1256
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:15,348
equivalent functionality but that's a

1257
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:18,540
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of stuff that's bad</font>

1258
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:23,010
it's not let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to the slides</font>

1259
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:24,660
here it's not just um you know dealing

1260
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:26,580
with stuff that you need to take away in

1261
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,790
the body a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times people don't</font>

1262
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:31,020

00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:19,760
set cookie header like seriously all of

1279
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:22,578
this is a cookie so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">over here whoa and so I'm gonna copy</font>

1282
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and I'm gonna stick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in what</font>

1283
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:35,960
we'll do another note pad and if I mess

1284
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,700
it up yeah do you like that it's hot

1285
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,819
normally the the dimensions are a lot

1286
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,990
higher so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the phone should</font>

1287
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:43,609
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> picking up you see first thing I'm</font>

1288
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:45,770
gonna do is I'm a turn-on word wrap and

1289
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:53,480
if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard you start seeing</font>

1290
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:54,710
patterns like half half half basically I

1291
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,730
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that but</font>

1292
00:52:54,710 --> 00:53:01,069
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come back to this thing they're</font>

1293
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically setting the same cookie you'll</font>

1294
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:05,990
notice the value is exactly the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1295
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:10,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">X I'll just kill this they're setting</font>

1296
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:12,379
the exact same cookie eight times

1297
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:16,819
because you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1298
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:18,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing sticks so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1299
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:20,680
programming block right what happens is

1300
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:26,058
that they restrict you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a question</font>

1301
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:28,190
no no that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool no it's the same</font>

1302
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:29,960
eight and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are client I</font>

1303
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,059
know why basically what happens is they

1304
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,920
have a shopping cart they have an

1305
00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:36,290
e-commerce site and so they have a

1306
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,450
function in PHP to basically says let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

1307
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:40,220
check to see if they already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1308
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:42,290
session and if they don't all set a

1309
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:44,540
cookie and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is is that the</font>

1310
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:47,150
function says basically that if logged

1311
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:48,829
in or if has session that is the

1312
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,550
function says do you have a session and

1313
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:52,470
if the answer is no I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign</font>

1314
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,960
session and<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is that it just can</font>

1315
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,399
catch onto the set cookie it doesn't

1316
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,320
check to see whether it already has and

1317
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,490
in the course of their trying to

1318
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,990
determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add an eye on through</font>

1319
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:03,120
shopping car to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their page generation</font>

1320
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:05,549
they call that<font color="#CCCCCC"> functioning times so it</font>

1321
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,350
appends a session the same session eight

1322
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,200
times every single time basically

1323
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:14,790
they're sending about 4k of cookie data

1324
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,410
on every single request everything when

1325
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:18,600
actually the cookie is something only

1326
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:21,569
like it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five hundred lights</font>

1327
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,610
so you can save 300 or you can save 3.5

1328
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:27,300
k off every single request just by

1329
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,890
programming mistake so a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1330
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> civil mistakes people</font>

1331
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,240
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you wouldn't really think but</font>

1332
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:36,210
let me tell you 3.5 k on every single

1333
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:42,450
request is a lot of data and it slows

1334
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:44,970
things down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> or in wait space crab</font>

1335
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:46,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright that's pretty funny so the other</font>

1336
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:50,009
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> browsing around</font>

1337
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:52,590
this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird I was looking at</font>

1338
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,180
so table<font color="#E5E5E5"> based layouts and also not just</font>

1339
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:57,510
that the entire site is laid out as a

1340
00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:01,819
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also useless tables if i look</font>

1341
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:07,170

00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:07,569
this image inside of it there's like

1364
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,399
random crap like that so even if unlike

1365
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:10,808
no starch where the entire page is laid

1366
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,859
out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1367
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:14,199
times where people are still using

00:56:11,859 --> 00:56:16,869
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> inline tables for layout purposes</font>

1369
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:18,249
and there's no real reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so anyway</font>

1370
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:21,729
also in new york<font color="#E5E5E5"> times in fact we'll</font>

1371
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:24,519
just do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot will do in live um so</font>

the zillions of examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crap that</font>

1399
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you shouldn't be sending but the other</font>

1400
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the number of trips</font>

1401
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:45,549
now this seems weird to people right

1402
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:48,490
there like what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean reduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1403
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:51,250
number of trips well remember the green

1404
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:53,410
on those mats the green<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I've sent the</font>

1405
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,450
request and i'm waiting for the response

1406
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:57,910
the green is basically network latency

1407
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:59,919
plus the amount of time it took the

1408
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:03,850
server to process and serve the response

1409
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,250
now basically here we see nothing but

1410
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,900
green because it's downloading like a

1411
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:10,510
little you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like the little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 by 16</font>

1412
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,990
facebook icon right that thing's what a

1413
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:17,050
que a que o to download a que over a

1414
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:19,000
cable modem that's that's you you blink

1415
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:21,100
it downloads faster than you blink um

1416
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,870
but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that you had to</font>

1417
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:28,210
wait 85 95 100 milliseconds for it to go

1418
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the server and come back just to</font>

1419
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,290
deliver that<font color="#E5E5E5"> teeny bit of data and the</font>

1420
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:35,830
problem is is that this actually gets

1421
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,020
works because pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a graph</font>

1422
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,120
it's not in this one basically the size

1423
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,400
of pages the number of objects a web

1424
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,640
page has has tripled in the last 30

1425
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,650
years so web pages are consisting in

1426
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:49,000
more and more external objects so

1427
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,340
they're spending more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1428
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,560
time just waiting to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> teeny bit of</font>

1429
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,050
data and so what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

1430
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:58,330
reduce the number of requests to go back

1431
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,010
to like the oj analogy right whenever

1432
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:02,140
you go to the grocery<font color="#E5E5E5"> store to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1433
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,240
making cookies right so you need flour

1434
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:06,100
and eggs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> milk and chocolate chips</font>

1435
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,660
and all that good stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you don't go</font>

1436
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,839
to the grocery store to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy one item and</font>

1437
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:12,730
then drive home and then drive well I do

1438
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,290
this when I forget this stuff but you

1439
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,239
know like the ideal is you make a list

1440
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,489
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go you get the six items you</font>

1441
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,619
you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back because round trips are</font>

1442
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:21,969
expensive well just like round trips are

1443
00:59:20,619 --> 00:59:23,769
expensive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grocery store</font>

1444
00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:26,859
round trips are expensive for the web

1445
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:29,319
server so one of the things here well

1446
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:33,939
we'll look at this in a second so one of

1447
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:37,679
the things you want to do do for those

1448
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:40,149
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> go these guys are a circle there a</font>

1449
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:42,219
ruby on rails developer group but I can

1450
00:59:40,149 --> 00:59:44,589
forgive them for that travesty<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1451
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:46,299
they're told steven alan and they even

1452
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:48,099
describe themselves as steven alan or

1453
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:50,889
your chubby founders of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bless everything</font>

1454
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:53,049
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like happy guys I can't</font>

1455
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:55,739
help but root for them so but I mean

1456
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:57,699
seriously look how happy they are so um

1457
00:59:55,739 --> 01:00:01,619
anyway if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of</font>

1458
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:01,619
their page and this is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

1459
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:14,319
home oh I can scroll scroll<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1460
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:16,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let me go down one what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1461
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,969
see we see wow they are grabbing one two

1462
01:00:16,749 --> 01:00:21,669
three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven eight</font>

1463
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:23,879
different JavaScript files now look

1464
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:26,229
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript files are</font>

1465
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:28,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript prototype Java scripts</font>

1466
01:00:26,229 --> 01:00:30,009
effects<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript's drag and drop all</font>

1467
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:33,279
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are served from the same</font>

1468
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:34,779
directory so instead of downloading you

1469
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:37,719
know one two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

1470
01:00:34,779 --> 01:00:40,029
eight vials why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I concatenate all</font>

1471
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:43,929
of those files together and call them

1472
01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:46,929
all my<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript Jas and I download</font>

1473
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:49,989
once so okay a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well</font>

1474
01:00:46,929 --> 01:00:52,149
that's that's literally you know half a

1475
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:53,949
dozen or six right you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing</font>

1476
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,569
it well what we're doing is we're

1477
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,069
reducing the number of requests and

1478
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:59,459
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a number of benefits</font>

1479
01:00:57,069 --> 01:01:03,489
that we get out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1480
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:06,939
sending one<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100k file is faster than</font>

1481
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:09,159
sending 10 10k files if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1482
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:12,009
about it from the Pinnacle promotions

1483
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:14,079
and having those extra cookies on every

1484
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:16,779
single response you've got the overhead

1485
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:19,779
of just doing HTTP but instead of saying

1486
01:01:16,779 --> 01:01:21,300
I want this one file let me wait that a

1487
01:01:19,779 --> 01:01:23,250
hundred milliseconds and then down

1488
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:25,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">big piece of data you have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1489
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,790
this file wait a hundred milliseconds

1490
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,530
get a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data I love this</font>

1491
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:31,500
file wait a hundred milliseconds add a

1492
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">little to the data so its tax and it's</font>

1493
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually worse so the other cool thing</font>

1494
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,750
is is that if you had say 10 files that

1495
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,520
are each 10 kilobytes if you concatenate

1496
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,710
them together and send it as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

1497
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">response it's not 100 k it's less than</font>

1498
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">100k because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're G zipping them right</font>

1499
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,780
it's compressing if you're compressing

1500
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:54,720
if you add if I compress<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 separate</font>

1501
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,490
files and I add them up let's say I can

1502
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,899
press them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten to nine because i</font>

1503
01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:59,729
have a small little bit of redundant

1504
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:02,670
data so by compressing a 10k file<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1505
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:04,980
get it to 9k but if you compress 100k

1506
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:06,930
file you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get it smut you</font>

1507
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,640
get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a compression because</font>

1508
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:11,220
there's more data there's more

1509
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,190
redundancy big files compressed better

1510
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:15,870
than small class so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get two bags for</font>

1511
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,820
your buck here you get less data you

1512
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:20,009
have to push down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pipe and you get</font>

1513
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:22,650
less trips to do it in this is when you

1514
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:24,150
can drastically improve the site when

1515
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:25,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you start doing stuff like this you're</font>

1516
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:28,170
knocking off let's see typically every

1517
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,180
file every external<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

1518
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:32,640
download adds a hundred milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1519
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:35,399
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about CNN and CNN has no</font>

1520
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,710
over 100 resources CNN you would think

1521
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:40,020
would take end up being like 10 seconds

1522
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,160
to herb yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 seconds to load it's not</font>

1523
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,530
because there's some things that can

1524
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,730
happen in parallel but typically when

1525
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,200
you start saying okay we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1526
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">take these 10 files and combine them to</font>

1527
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:53,669
one that's a second you just saved a

1528
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,230
second puff of pages of time exactly

1529
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:57,840
it's happen flus all that overhead of

1530
01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,120
HTTP and plus the yeah basically

1531
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,390
everything it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a no-brainer to do</font>

1532
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:06,089
this anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question alright sweet</font>

1533
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's pretty you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

1534
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight I've seen nine what's the worst I</font>

1535
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:16,460
have ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rackspace has 17 external</font>

1537
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:26,828
let's go see how silly they are

1538
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:28,660
is that no Rach<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress is really bad</font>

1539
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:32,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">because every plug-in has its own</font>

1540
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript file and CSS files so luckily</font>

1541
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:36,759
there are some wordpress plugins that

1542
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:38,950
will run towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end and it will</font>

1543
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,750
dynamically combine those into a single

1544
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:42,700
file for you there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> called WP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minna</font>

1545
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">fire which does the minification and</font>

1546
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:46,960
then there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one auto optimizer</font>

1547
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:50,410
there's another one that does the

1548
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:57,900
concatenated files let's look at

1549
01:03:50,410 --> 01:04:00,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rackspace this just cracks me up okay so</font>

1550
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:04,569
thank God just annoys<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I don't know</font>

1551
01:04:00,339 --> 01:04:06,009
why he does<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes exactly well if we</font>

1552
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:08,109
do facebook you can rick rolled us all

1553
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,520
so i'm using the web developer toolbar<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1554
01:04:08,109 --> 01:04:11,348
said show me all the JavaScript by when

1555
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,049
I collapsed let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> count the JavaScript</font>

1556
01:04:11,349 --> 01:04:17,380
loved one what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bottle you know</font>

1557
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:18,819
so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ah so they make my</font>

1558
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,980
crazy right like so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font>

1559
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:23,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at drag and drop Oh surprise</font>

1560
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:25,420
surprise it's not minified so they're

1561
01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:30,460
downloading 17 files and none of them

1562
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:33,900
are minified kind of silly um oh it

1563
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,900
doesn't that's really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of annoyed oh</font>

1564
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:41,099
man doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey okay I'm to Maisie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1565
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:43,598
there's something that but noise I wish

1566
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:45,250
anybody here actually contribute code to

1567
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,740
Firefox<font color="#CCCCCC"> and work on firefox or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla</font>

1568
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:49,240
in any way the feature that I want I

1569
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:52,720
want to be able to like right click and

1570
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:54,308
say close not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the windows but I want</font>

1571
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,740

1572
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:58,930
accurate day it will have like 15 things

1573
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:03,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">thats a source of sorts of sore so it's</font>

1574
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:04,839
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> huge pain in the ass alright so to</font>

1575
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:08,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this guy you got to cover that</font>

1576
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:10,328
guy up he's freaking me out but then

1577
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:14,799
they have really odd things right like

1578
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:17,289
dude if you to do so scripts / classes

1579
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:19,630
collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> notch is set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> j/s thank you</font>

1580
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,220
for reproducing you know basic CS theory

1581
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,589
data structures because<font color="#E5E5E5"> javascript</font>

1582
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,959
doesn't have those natively it does that

1583
01:05:23,589 --> 01:05:27,680
means

1584
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,030
tastic rackspace menus key events so all

1585
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:31,098
of these things basically there's

1586
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:32,720
several files that can be combined now I

1587
01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you're thinking oh my god some</font>

1588
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,750
guy in high tea is going to combine live

1589
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,700
first you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> white space</font>

1590
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:39,770
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to combine my files yes I do</font>

1591
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:48,759
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> while breaking up your files</font>

1592
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:51,770
into sets like let's go look at say a

1593
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:54,710
toast exactly and look how big said it

1594
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:56,480
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you can see the bar and</font>

1595
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:57,740
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of</font>

1596
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,150
this is comments which will get stripped

1597
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:00,770
everywhere so it's a really good

1598
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">development practice to break things</font>

1599
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:05,509
into separate files right we've all seen

1600
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:07,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sea program that has nothing but</font>

1601
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,430
void main void right and it's

1602
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:12,710
15k or well actually more like 120

1603
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:16,009
anyway oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> why did anybody do this</font>

1604
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:18,109
this is horrible and they probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse</font>

1605
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:19,940
the c preprocessor quite a bit too but

1606
01:06:18,109 --> 01:06:21,740
so it's a good idea from a development

1607
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:23,030
point of view to break things in two

1608
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,560
separate libraries that make sense

1609
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:26,690
they're easy to manage is your source

1610
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,160
code from an end user performance point

1611
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,410
of view it's the worst thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

1612
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,629
ever like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should kill kittens before</font>

1613
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:38,270
you do that because it totally ruins

1614
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:39,920
your end users experience Billy since

1615
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:41,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've been thinking on that Riley for</font>

1616
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,570
like six or eight minutes or something

1617
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:46,430
now they thought maybe that you'd call

1618
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:48,109
you have you got that boom I actually

1619
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:49,430
reached out to them once because I wrote

1620
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:52,430
I've written some stuff for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Make</font>

1621
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Magazine about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> match strikes and I</font>

1622
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,759
reached out to like the editors and

1623
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,348
stuff I knew I'm like and the pest

1624
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,940
against O'Reilly runs a conference

1625
01:06:57,349 --> 01:07:01,280
called velocity which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to</font>

1626
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,470
make websites fast and their website is

1627
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,690
really really slow not just oreilly com

1628
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:10,069
but the website about the conference

1629
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:11,750
about making websites fast is slow it

1630
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,700
doesn't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't make sense tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1631
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a security because it's hard for</font>

1632
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,049
hackers three of its actually the reason

1633
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,859
those people are going is because they

1634
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:23,420
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you think you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1635
01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:24,529
Beagle putting on the conference would

1636
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,170
know that's a

1637
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:28,370
yeah well what's interesting actually so

1638
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just mentioned it's harder for</font>

1639
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:32,240
hackers to read I found this great

1640
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:35,180
website the other day called j/s

1641
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,500
beautifier org<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to write one of</font>

1642
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:38,270
these from scratch and it was a huge

1643
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">pain in the ass and I never got</font>

1644
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:42,590
permission from HP to release it but but

1645
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,720
basically it takes off his gated

1646
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript and makes it pretty with</font>

1647
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,660
indenting and white space and all that

1648
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:50,420
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so basically it's a way to go back</font>

1649
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:53,180
from minification which is really nice

1650
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:55,460
because normally if you do that on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1651
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:58,270
own you have to write a tokenizer and

1652
01:07:55,460 --> 01:08:01,010
then a parser and then it's it's not fun

1653
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:03,080
all right anytime you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with a</font>

1654
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:04,940
language that allows regex literals

1655
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:09,799
totally screws you up when you're

1656
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:11,600
writing a tokenizer a parser<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1657
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,810
so CSS sprites who here has ever heard

1658
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:17,269
of a CSS sprite awesome excellent great

1659
01:08:14,810 --> 01:08:20,990
so a CSS sprite is who here remembers

1660
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:23,870
filmstrips in school right<font color="#E5E5E5"> no like boob</font>

1661
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,068
like I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> that little noise and if you</font>

1662
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,990
were really good you got to be the guy

1663
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:29,240
who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there turning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any film strip</font>

1664
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:33,979
yeah see you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> always one behind yes</font>

1665
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:36,290
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> really keep up so um a CSS sprite is</font>

1666
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:40,219
like a film strip or I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of</font>

1667
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:43,370
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Bowie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> G board basically no it's</font>

1668
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:45,440
it's true um basically this is actually

1669
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,260
the CSS<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprite image that Google hats</font>

1670
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,059
here well we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> live as I said so</font>

1671
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,839
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the live autopsies so let's</font>

1672
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this stuff Doug Doug Doug</font>

1673
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:59,689
Wheelock um alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've got this</font>

1674
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:02,358
logo we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything else and let's</font>

1675
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:07,358
actually go to you know cats whatever I

1676
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:11,839
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> cats</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so view show me the image</font>

1677
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:15,430
see so that image if we go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

1678
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:18,290
say show me what this sucker is doing

1679
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:23,330
what it's doing is it has a single image

1680
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:25,580
and then it's using basically here it's

1681
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,229
a lot easier to see on this what it's

1682
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:29,089
doing is it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single image and</font>

1683
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it says all right here's the image</font>

1684
01:09:29,089 --> 01:09:31,040
i watch

1685
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,299
show but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want you to show the</font>

1686
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:35,540
entire image I want you to go to

1687
01:09:32,299 --> 01:09:37,160
negative 60 pixels in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction</font>

1688
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:40,220
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero pixels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the X direction and</font>

1689
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,960
only show this part and then for the

1690
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,120
colors or for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that move up and move</font>

1691
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,890
down for your custom google stuff let me

1692
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,809
show this people it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Ouija</font>

1693
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">board you've got all these letters and</font>

1694
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:51,230
you're moving the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and say</font>

1695
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">just show me this just show me this so</font>

1696
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:54,740
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how basically that's the</font>

1697
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:57,470
equipment of<font color="#E5E5E5"> combining CSS or JavaScript</font>

1698
01:09:54,740 --> 01:10:00,469
files but for images yeah how many using

1699
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:04,310
going to expose anything that supports

1700
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:05,690
CSS supports this yeah because what it's

1701
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:08,720
doing is it's saying both of these

1702
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:11,570
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is actually used on yahoo</font>

1703
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:13,130
and AOL a lot they'll have any time you

1704
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:15,740
seem like a bunch of menu items with

1705
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:17,690
icons or if you've got a web page that

1706
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:19,429
shows like different translations and

1707
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:21,799
they'll show different country flags all

1708
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:23,840
of those or you're dealing with say on

1709
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,430
any news site and you like print this

1710
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,840
article e-mail this article and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got</font>

1711
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,600
the little you know like the envelope

1712
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,520
icon and the printer icon and they get

1713
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,530
up save this to facebook icon whatever

1714
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,450
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> always really good candidates</font>

1715
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:38,420
for this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> while on yahoo what they</font>

1716
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:40,580
have is this car autos like here's the

1717
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,410
actual image they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

1718
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,080
nation we say okay for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> span for the</font>

1719
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:46,940
game we want you to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sprites but</font>

1720
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:51,500
go to background position you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

1721
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:53,570
pixels over and negative 212 so only

1722
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,700
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game controller now for</font>

1723
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:58,490
the stock picker we want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

1724
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same image I've got this backwards</font>

1725
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:02,660
but go up here negative so you're only

1726
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,190
showing this may be rather than a

1727
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:06,110
website that's optimized but not

1728
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:07,969
optimized with it uses this quite

1729
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:11,360
lightweight but it only uses one sprite

1730
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:13,520
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular page oh well that</font>

1731
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,440
would just be get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would just</font>

1732
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,460
be a regular background image right if I

1733
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,200
would say I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just grabbing the hole in</font>

1734
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is opposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all it needed was a</font>

1735
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,670
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> itty-bitty view ah so that's a</font>

1736
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:25,610
good point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to combine</font>

1737
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:26,990
all of your images necessarily into a

1738
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:28,759
single sprite but you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1739
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:31,340
do is break it into five or six strikes

1740
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:32,420
because like for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo it worked</font>

1741
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:33,280
out really well because all of these

1742
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:36,039
images are just

1743
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,389
front<font color="#CCCCCC"> page but if only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this image was</font>

1744
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:39,340
displayed on the front page and these

1745
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:41,079
were used what you're logged into yahoo

1746
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:42,460
mail it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> no sense for you to</font>

1747
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:44,139
download them now you're making

1748
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,610
everybody download when<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably only</font>

1749
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:48,309
ten percent of the people who visit your

1750
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:49,690
main page<font color="#E5E5E5"> also visit and use this so you</font>

1751
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:51,070
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smart and actually our</font>

1752
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:52,869
software kind of helps you figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1753
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:55,630
based on traffic patterns what should be

1754
01:11:52,869 --> 01:11:58,210
grouped together but this is what CSS

1755
01:11:55,630 --> 01:12:00,610
sprites are now really close to CSS

1756
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:03,940
sprites<font color="#CCCCCC"> our image</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Maps let's go kick no</font>

1757
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:05,920
search in the nuts again so I like no

1758
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:10,058
starch a lot so not trying to be mean

1759
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:12,099
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

1760
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:15,849
images right next to one another and

1761
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:19,090
we've got and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you right-click do a</font>

1762
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:22,329
view image it's a separate image the

1763
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:25,659
Magna guiding calculus people will put

1764
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:28,090
japanese schoolgirls on anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1765
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so um you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Google way</font>

1766
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:33,520
whatever so all of these are images why

1767
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,170
isn't this just one big image right like

1768
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,570
why am I downloading<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two three four</font>

1769
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:39,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">five six seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> images these images</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1770
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:40,869
always in the footer they're always

1771
01:12:39,219 --> 01:12:43,510
together this isn't a dynamically

1772
01:12:40,869 --> 01:12:44,980
generated page like you can refresh this

1773
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:48,639
page as much as you want these images

1774
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:50,138
don't they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so what really</font>

1775
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:52,179
should be is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be one image</font>

1776
01:12:50,139 --> 01:12:55,000
that should be transparent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you</font>

1777
01:12:52,179 --> 01:12:56,500
get this yellow shining through and you

1778
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,239
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single image for all of</font>

1779
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,860
these guys and then has anybody here

1780
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:02,799
ever used a client-side image map or

1781
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:07,659
written a client size image map yeah it

1782
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:08,949
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this too so basically the</font>

1783
01:13:07,659 --> 01:13:12,250
pattern you're kind of looking for an

1784
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:14,019
HTML is a series of hyperlinks that have

1785
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:15,820
images inside of them that are next to

1786
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,739
each other it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> look instead of</font>

1787
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:19,299
having an image that's a link in an

1788
01:13:17,739 --> 01:13:21,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">image that's a link you see this a lot</font>

1789
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,840
also on blogs where it's like follow us

1790
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,400
on Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually i'll show you a</font>

1791
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:30,059
really good example on the zoom page

1792
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:30,058
we're doing it so come

1793
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:38,500
so this thing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here follow us on</font>

1794
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:40,810
twitter if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go right click should there</font>

1795
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,489
should actually up here we go image so

1796
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,560
it's showing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this image right here</font>

1797
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:46,509
is actually the three of them and then

1798
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:53,590
here I'll I'll view it in the code that

1799
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">way you can see it better uh yeah so</font>

1800
01:13:53,590 --> 01:14:02,620
right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt so basically my images</font>

1801
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:04,599
here and if I go to this image<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

1802
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:06,519
that the three it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> three separate</font>

1803
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:12,280
images it's a single image and then in

1804
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:13,270
my source uh what you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1805
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,960
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to preserve the</font>

1806
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:18,880
formatting not in that case because I

1807
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,260
did that's kind of funny actually that

1808
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,550
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did need to preserve format</font>

1809
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:24,280
because it was important to the end user

1810
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:26,350
so a map basically says look hey this

1811
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:28,210
image it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using this map</font>

1812
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:31,090
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mat basically says look if</font>

1813
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:33,699
they're in a rectangle defined by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

1814
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:35,409
30 30 if they click their send them to

1815
01:14:33,699 --> 01:14:37,059

really close all titles<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a source of</font>

1836
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,730
add-on right that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not where it's like</font>

1837
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:34,910
okay what's the one I use auto I would

1839
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:38,389
adjacent images that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can replace</font>

01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:40,250
with image<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maps so again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really great</font>

1841
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that you can actually produce the</font>

1842
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,760
number of requests that need to be made

1843
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:45,830
um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I'd point out other</font>

1844
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,010
really stupid stuff so let's look at

1845
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:52,280
sears calm because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of silly</font>

1846
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:54,220
well so this is the this is the i can

1847
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:59,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you the entire water fall for it</font>

1848
01:15:54,220 --> 01:16:02,960
now Freddie Sears<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

1849
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:05,269
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I love the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Firefox zooms</font>

1850
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,750
images as well as text so wow that's

1851
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:11,720
really zoomed in so we see right here

1852
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:13,940
that you visit<font color="#E5E5E5"> sears calm and it gives</font>

1853
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,860
you a 301 which is a redirect and it

1854
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:19,879
basically says hey I'm not going to give

1855
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you data go to dub dub dub series com so</font>

1856
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,740
you go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it says ah do a</font>

1857
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:27,349
redirect to SS 0 now somebody who has

1858
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:29,809
dealt<font color="#E5E5E5"> with networks a lot SSO almost</font>

1859
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:32,300
entirely always means single sign-on

1860
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:33,760
portal which is like here authenticate

1861
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:37,700
with an RS ID or something like that

1862
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:43,030
basically if we actually um use our HTTP

1863
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:43,030
editor to see this let's do HTTP

1864
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:48,740
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote um you can</font>

1865
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:50,450
i recommend burp suite there's a really

1866
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:52,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way of editing so this is like kind</font>

1867
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:55,340
of an inline performance tool that what

1868
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,170
you type in say let me see this response

1869
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:59,060
and then it also raids it for the issues

1870
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk about this later but we have</font>

1871
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:02,330
some free tools that you all can

01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:09,050
websites which is pretty cool but so

1875
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:12,589
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're what they're doing in a</font>

01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:18,620
nutshell<font color="#E5E5E5"> dub dub dub sears.com so if you</font>

1878
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,010
they're having duplicate cookies so the

1879
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,379
same way that pinnacle promotions site

1880
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:25,460
had you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten or eight duplicate</font>

1881
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:28,550
cookies actually if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1882
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:32,030
headers they set the JCL<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah see</font>

1883
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:36,380
they're doing it too ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go cookies</font>

1884
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:38,690
there's one WP persistence I don't know

1885
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe that's a bug anyway so they're</font>

1886
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:43,969
sending us they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no first</font>

1889
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,010
sign-on service and this has all sorts

1890
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:55,700
of fun variables like site source ID

1891

take x equals true service<font color="#E5E5E5"> key if I were</font>

still hacking websites<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was allowed to</font>

1893
01:17:57,110 --> 01:18:02,240
play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this so anyway that if</font>

1894
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:04,070
we go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the load graph that is</font>

1895
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:07,700
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> single sign-on service which</font>

1896
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:09,769
then basically we if you don't enter

1897
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:12,889
anything in it sends you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this other</font>

1899
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:17,960
to sears.com home and then it's not

1900
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:20,330
until the seventh request if we look

1901
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">down here this is a website called</font>

webpagetest org that generates the

1903
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:29,000

1904
01:18:23,930 --> 01:18:31,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">until here we go response headers right</font>

1905
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,560
there HTML so if not until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighth</font>

1919
01:18:58,639 --> 01:19:03,380
until and this is second it's not until

1920
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:07,670
two seconds into the process before you

1921
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:09,679
get the webpage so sears.com on every

1922
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:11,270
single actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses cookies so it only</font>

1923
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,550
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to you once but basically every</font>

1924
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:15,320
single visitor is delayed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by two seconds</font>

1925
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,510
just to do some crazy single<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign-on</font>

1926
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,400
crap which is probably used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1927
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:21,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal system so they can need a login</font>

1928
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,150
and debug it or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

1929
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:24,830
why it does this but it does this for

1930
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:27,799
everything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's two seconds they're</font>

1931
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:29,239
adding on to every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> page totally</font>

1932
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:36,409
unnecessary from a performance point of

view that's retarded webpagetest a zip

1934

see if they're minified and they didn't

1951
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:29,960
minify them and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking along</font>

and I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that looks a little</font>

1953
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:40,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">weird and it's right here https that's</font>

1954
01:20:35,389 --> 01:20:44,750
ssl i visited the main page of gateway

1955
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:45,980
com it sent me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a CSS file which is</font>

1956
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to tell me how to draw the page</font>

1957
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:50,830
and then the CSS file is downloading a

1958
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:53,350
lot of images but it's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

1959
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:56,600
everybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows when ssl was right</font>

1960
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:58,130
no ours is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like God why dare did</font>

1961
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,330
you ask me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question or was that a</font>

1962
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:02,870
no i don't but i don't

1963
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:04,220
volunteer I never can I can never do

1964
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:06,290
reference that whole former or latter

1965
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:08,660
most which one do they mean like is

1966
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:10,460
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind so is that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

1967
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:13,340
explain what SSL is anyway and you can't

1968
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">get me out this podium so okay then I</font>

1969
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:18,890
won't anyway so they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

1970
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:20,660
whenever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see ssl on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal website</font>

1971
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:22,640
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not logged in they're being</font>

1972
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid because the whole point of SSL</font>

1973
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,390
right is confidentiality but you can't

1974
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:28,879
see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being sick but the thing is</font>

1975
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:31,790
if I'm not authenticated to you you have

1976
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">no idea who I am so you have no business</font>

1977
01:21:31,790 --> 01:21:35,690
sending me anything that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1978
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:37,430
confidential because you don't have

1979
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,280
anything that you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to me cuz</font>

1980
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:43,550
you know who the hell I am so the fact

1981
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:45,380
that they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL is stupid um how</font>

1982
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:48,560
stupid you ask well<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's look at the</font>

1983
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:50,780
load draft because SSL is extremely

1984
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,960
costly to the server it has to do an

1985
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:55,160
initial asymmetric key transfer and then

1986
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,900
have to use a symmetric key encryption

1987
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,340
to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a symmetric key encryption</font>

1988
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:01,879
and it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep that symmetric</font>

1989
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:07,490
session live a new ssl renegotiation so

1990
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:10,010
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no that's</font>

1991
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:12,320
right space<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay wait here we go all</font>

1992
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:15,800
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna close it down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1993
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,990
so pink is SSL negotiation so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1994
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,630
on we're just want a regular HD GD page

1995
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:22,340
gateway we grab the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Styles page and then</font>

1996
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:25,340
it starts fetching things that style

1997
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:27,140
references and so we see bang purple

1998
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's having to use SSL</font>

1999
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:32,210
negotiation and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we jump to that this</font>

2000
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:36,440
one file ssl negotiation took a third of

2001
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:38,840
a second so fetching this image which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

2002
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just this border for those of you who</font>

2003
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:42,980
conceived in charge that border can

2004
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,900
change extremely confidential

2005
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:49,190
information we have to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font>

2006
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:50,990
you know 124 bit you know RSA keys and

2007
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:52,969
here's the funny thing right I'm just

2008
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to come up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm gonna take</font>

2009
01:22:52,970 --> 01:23:01,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that s off I still get the image there's</font>

2010
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:03,358
no reason to use SSL so how much is this

2011
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">hurting them</font>

2012
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:10,659
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably so how wait a minute well</font>

2013
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:13,179
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was over here back back so that</font>

2014
01:23:10,659 --> 01:23:16,138
cause I'm a third of a second the purple

2015
01:23:13,179 --> 01:23:18,550
is where they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue doing</font>

2016
01:23:16,139 --> 01:23:21,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">renegotiations so all of this purple and</font>

2017
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:24,699
these little ones add you know 90

2018
01:23:21,729 --> 01:23:26,889
seconds 90 milliseconds you know not not

2019
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:30,928
a huge amount but there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

2020
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:33,069
so basically if you add all of these up

2021
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:35,559
twenty-five percent of the page load

2022
01:23:33,069 --> 01:23:38,289
time if you aggregate that it's 1.5

2023
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:41,889
seconds due to the overhead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL 20</font>

2024
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:44,889
let the page loads in a little over five

2025
01:23:41,889 --> 01:23:46,599
seconds so over<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent of</font>

2026
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:49,510
the total time it takes to load the page

2027
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:54,429
is justice all this ssl crap which they

2028
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:56,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing anyway ah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

2029
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:57,789
tell you why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they did it well</font>

2030
01:23:56,169 --> 01:24:00,219
first of all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys just made a</font>

2031
01:23:57,789 --> 01:24:01,898
mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> they put a couple of s's when</font>

2032
01:24:00,219 --> 01:24:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">their didn't need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> esas and they</font>

2033
01:24:01,899 --> 01:24:05,619
just blew themselves in the foot that

2034
01:24:04,269 --> 01:24:07,839
sounded really dirty they shot

2035
01:24:05,619 --> 01:24:10,989
themselves in the foot with a gun they

2036
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:13,689
flew home and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> added 1.5</font>

2037
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:15,608
seconds for no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatsoever to the</font>

2038
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:16,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the load I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2039
01:24:15,609 --> 01:24:19,329
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think whether the developers</font>

2040
01:24:16,929 --> 01:24:22,419
like hey Johnny I totally can make our

2041
01:24:19,329 --> 01:24:23,648
sights lower I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like no no you can</font>

2042
01:24:22,419 --> 01:24:25,148
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seriously I'm gonna make it</font>

2043
01:24:23,649 --> 01:24:29,199
slow and i'm only gonna use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

2044
01:24:25,149 --> 01:24:30,969
character<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to think that this was a</font>

2045
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:36,068
dare like i could slow it down using a

2046
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:37,839
single bite but here's why I think that

2047
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:39,159
so to answer your question why in god's

2048
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:41,919
name would anyone do this who hears

2049
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:43,898
heard of a mixed content warning so if

2050
01:24:41,919 --> 01:24:45,398
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever browsing around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i use really</font>

2051
01:24:43,899 --> 01:24:47,800
bad about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox freaks out a lot</font>

2052
01:24:45,399 --> 01:24:49,629
too if you're on a site using SSL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2053
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:53,079
it's fetching an image or something with

2054
01:24:49,629 --> 01:24:54,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that not using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL a possible warning it</font>

2055
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:55,869
basically says whoa whoa whoa you're on

2056
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:57,398
an encrypted page but you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

2057
01:24:55,869 --> 01:24:59,108
get some crap that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> over an</font>

2058
01:24:57,399 --> 01:25:01,359
encrypted connection we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some</font>

2059
01:24:59,109 --> 01:25:03,939
cookies there could be bad stuff so what

2060
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,909
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think happened is that this style</font>

2061
01:25:03,939 --> 01:25:10,559
sheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I think this style sheet</font>

2062
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:13,478
right here is referenced by both the on

2063
01:25:10,559 --> 01:25:15,150
logged in part of gateway calm and then

2064
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:17,880
the part of where your

2065
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:20,670
and so because they didn't want a

2066
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,409
warning they put HTTP to that when you

2067
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:24,030
are not logged in you just screw

2068
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:25,589
everybody and make them wait one and a

2069
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:27,120
half seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logged in</font>

2070
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:28,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get an annoying error message</font>

2071
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,750
problem is that there's a much better

2072
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:34,468
solution who here has ever heard of

2073
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:37,760
protocol relative URLs Wow hardly

2074
01:25:34,469 --> 01:25:43,850
anybody this is this is awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

2075
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:43,850
get rid of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barmes</font>

2076
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's a distinct possibility so</font>

2077
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:54,450
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say like gateway calm / we'll just</font>

2078
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:56,549
make this easy style.css and on this

2079
01:25:54,450 --> 01:26:00,660
page actually let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it even</font>

2080
01:25:56,550 --> 01:26:03,480
easier well just do you know index.html

2081
01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:07,620
and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this page you know it's a</font>

2082
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTML document and some are in it they've</font>

2083
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:14,120
got to say like image source equals

2084
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTTPS colon slash slash food every game</font>

2085
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:23,400
whatever gateway calm / you know logo

2086
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:25,740
dot PNG and so that way whether you're

2087
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:28,320
visiting this gateway over SSL or not

2088
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:32,510
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have the SSL logo but the</font>

2089
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:35,400
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that if you take this and</font>

2090
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:38,100
put that that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol</font>

2091
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:42,330
relative URL it basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> says huh they</font>

2092
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:44,730
fetch<font color="#E5E5E5"> this HTML file using HTTP so I</font>

2093
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:46,890
will fetch this resource because the

2094
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:49,019
protocol isn't defined I'll fetch it

2095
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:50,960
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resource or the protocol that</font>

2096
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:54,180
was used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> containing document</font>

2097
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,860
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the parents so if they if</font>

2098
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:58,380
they got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seat so in this example</font>

2099
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:00,839
there was an HTML page that linked to a

2100
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:04,290
CSS page that had the images using<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL</font>

2101
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,950
if inside since the CSS page was

2102
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:09,900
referenced using HTTP if the links to

2103
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:11,910
the images in the CSS document used

2104
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:14,759
protocol relative it would go up to what

2105
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:16,320
the CSS file had been fetch with so the

2106
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,930
other cool thing is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

2107
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,880
get rid of the SSL problem the 1.5

2108
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:22,830
seconds of you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

2109
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,360
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a document</font>

2110
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:26,940
smaller because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> eliminated five</font>

2111
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:33,170
bytes from every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> image that's</font>

2112
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:33,169
there yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font>

2113
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:46,790
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is I've gotta think</font>

2114
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:50,090
that date<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wacom has done a site redesign</font>

2115
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:51,290
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netscape or came out right we're</font>

2116
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,909
like I'm because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing these</font>

2117
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,500
revaluations I was dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

2118
01:27:52,909 --> 01:27:56,570
some guys the other day were like we

2119
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,949
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> support IE six anymore which</font>

2120
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:59,900
good thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> god that's a horrible zombie</font>

2121
01:27:57,949 --> 01:28:02,119
but um you know what I'm saying like

2122
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:03,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's I understand your argument but</font>

2123
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:05,690
that's a silly argument we should punch

2124
01:28:03,739 --> 01:28:09,110
them in the face we do it together you

2125
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:15,650
can hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> them down oh wow all right all</font>

2126
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:18,199
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so needless say I</font>

2127
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:19,848
I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what they're not gonna</font>

2134
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:47,420

01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,848
have lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so some of</font>

2150
01:29:24,349 --> 01:29:28,310
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that we talked about our</font>

01:29:25,849 --> 01:29:32,210
things web develop of the IT guys cancel

2152
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:34,120
so crunching images minification or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

manifestation crunching<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

2154
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:38,000
HTTP compression we didn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

2155
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:40,040
caching there's lots of stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

2156
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,260
simply server configuration issues but

2157
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:44,450
then there are things like combining

2158
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:46,460
images that you're probably going to

2159
01:29:44,450 --> 01:29:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to work with the web developer now</font>

2160
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:50,300
for small sites like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure your</font>

2161
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:52,690
you're both the web developer and the IT

2162
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:55,130
guy because you're running your own site

2163
01:29:52,690 --> 01:29:56,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just depends on the maturity</font>

2164
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:58,730
of your organization like are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2165
01:29:56,870 --> 01:30:00,559
freaking using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pico from a cell phone to</font>

modify PHP in a production banking app

2167
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:05,360
or do you have more of a process at

2168
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:07,910
place so it how you do these

2169
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,880
optimizations is going to bury an

2170
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:13,250
organization but everybody can right now

2171
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,080
go crunch our images turn on compression

2172
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,820
minify there's no reason you can't do

2173
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:18,050
any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff right now and you</font>

2174
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:20,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to tell the web developer</font>

2175
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:22,850
you're doing it unless they don't have

2176
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:40,600
source control and they're actually like

2177
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:40,600
the production<font color="#E5E5E5"> site is there so</font>

2178
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm using you to example of for web</font>

2179

2181
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:59,950
arguments but because it took him all

2182
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:01,750
the way up to four<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago we had a</font>

2183
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:05,080
better place now it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank you</font>

2184
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:07,750
baby steps we dancers so to answer your

2185
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:11,230
question about some of this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by</font>

2186
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:13,780
the frameworks and dodgin most<font color="#E5E5E5"> boo 30</font>

2187
01:31:11,230 --> 01:31:16,240
the issues so mark company finds about

2188
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:17,620
over 300 performance issues now and i

2189
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:19,510
would say thirty to forty percent

2190
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:21,190
actually can be fixed by IT that have

2191
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:23,680
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with necessarily underline</font>

2192
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:24,820
structure so what of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a seriously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

2193
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,440
show you the list and i can walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

2194
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:34,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can show you which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's actually</font>

2195

2197
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:39,400
thing about this is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools</font>

2198
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:41,200
we've done which are free you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to</font>

2199
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,460
zoom calm right now and get scans and

2200
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,019
they'll tell you how much you say it

2201
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:46,060
goes through it it says yeah if you cut

2202
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:47,740
your image you're going to save seventy

2203
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:49,570
percent of your bandwidth bill if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2204
01:31:47,740 --> 01:31:51,730
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on HTTP compression for these</font>

2205
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:53,380
resources you will consume this much

2206
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:55,360
less and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> our professional</font>

01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we know exactly how much data you're</font>

2209
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,480

01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:08,500
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> say why one hundred percent so I'm</font>

2212
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:11,590
actually not going to continue to find

2213
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:15,310
problems with sites now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chairman</font>

01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:31,660
go to zoom calm right now we you punch

2220
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:33,430
it in it's entirely automated and so you

2221
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,050
can plug your information in basically

2222

my checks now and automatically generate

2228
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:53,200
a report<font color="#CCCCCC"> an email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you that's it right</font>

2229
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:56,860
there you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug your information in</font>

2230
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:57,469
everything works out um the other thing

2231
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,969
is is like

2232
01:32:57,469 --> 01:33:00,229
I hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when people get up and say</font>

2233
01:32:58,969 --> 01:33:01,579
even if they're offering something curry

2234
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:02,659
and then they have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid they</font>

2235
01:33:01,579 --> 01:33:06,469
don't tell you other alternatives

2236
01:33:02,659 --> 01:33:08,449
there's a great tool from yahoo co why

2237
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:11,449
slow it's a plug-in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Firebug which is</font>

2238
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:12,860
a plug-in to fire box to find some of

2239
01:33:11,449 --> 01:33:15,249
these issues they only find about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

2240
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:17,420
dozen google has one goal page speed

2241
01:33:15,249 --> 01:33:19,460
there's that great website we talked

2242
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:21,559
about earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> webpagetest org that</font>

2243
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:23,900
generates the<font color="#CCCCCC"> waterfall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document to tell</font>

2244
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:25,070
you everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we write a lot</font>

2245
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:28,728
of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool stuff on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our blog</font>

2246
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:30,710
actually google released a new version

2247
01:33:28,729 --> 01:33:33,050
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their tool in February and actually</font>

2248
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:34,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">referenced or some articles we had</font>

2249
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:36,050
written on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our blog where we had found</font>

2250
01:33:34,309 --> 01:33:37,909
kind of some new performance issues that

2251
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:39,739
dealt with CSS issues we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> found and</font>

2252
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:41,780
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually added checks to their</font>

2253
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:43,249
product and credited us saying we didn't

2254
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:44,929
know about these these guys found<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

2255
01:33:43,249 --> 01:33:46,789
so we're now adding that to our

2256
01:33:44,929 --> 01:33:48,409
preschool so we're doing a pretty good

2257
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:49,999
job of finding new performance problems

2258
01:33:48,409 --> 01:33:52,429
that people don't know about and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

2259
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:59,780
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> us on the blog or just send me an</font>

2260
01:33:52,429 --> 01:34:03,860
email Billy at zoom yeah haha what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

2261
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:07,210
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was bad do something you</font>

2262
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:07,210
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> unsee what's up straight</font>

2263
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:20,150
you're talking about closure Google's

2264
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:23,450
closure so I like closure um the problem

2265
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:26,830
the difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> with closure is when your</font>

2266
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:28,820
site fails in production and you get a

2267
01:34:26,830 --> 01:34:30,019
basically an error log and they're like

2268
01:34:28,820 --> 01:34:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah the thing that appears in the</font>

2269
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:36,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript console is variable ABC puked</font>

2270
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:40,370
and function underscore F underscore two

2271
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:42,350
three four well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying is</font>

2272
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:44,780
is that as part of the conversion

2273
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:46,070
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's running on your site is</font>

2274
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:48,500
different than what's in your

2275
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:50,480
environment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it can be very</font>

2276
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:52,370
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get bug reports that it's</font>

2277
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,019
running on different code<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's</font>

2278
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:57,769
functionally equivalent it syntactically

2279
01:34:54,020 --> 01:35:02,450
different and try to trace it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

2280
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:05,420
ups closure is really impressive ya know

2281
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:06,950
i i'm down for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we zoom we</font>

2282
01:35:05,420 --> 01:35:09,020
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people use closure and</font>

2283
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:10,880
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are concerned about that</font>

2284
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:12,500
we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and</font>

2285
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,350
if they're concerned we recommend a tool

2286
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:17,030
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> men or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll compressor</font>

2287
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:19,370
which does a really good job of just

2288
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:20,980
removing white space and your your

2289
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:23,000
variable names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your functions and</font>

2290
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:32,179
syntactically your code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is exactly the</font>

2291
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:34,130
same if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that problem yeah yeah</font>

2292
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:38,000
we use a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little Bobby tables</font>

2293
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:41,120
method for that with a tick drop with

2294
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,710
your user name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody have any other</font>

2295
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions performance performance</font>

2296
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright cool thanks agent</font>

2297
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">gathers you have a shared</font>

2298
01:35:50,810 --> 01:35:57,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh good point so we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

2299
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:59,900
series of blog posts that are questions

2300
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,480
to ask your hosting provider ma gzip is

2301
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:04,400
actually enabled by default in every

2302
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:06,320
single default apache config so it's

2303
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:08,809
already compiled in and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

2304
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,340
you if you have HT<font color="#E5E5E5"> access you can create</font>

2305
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">an HT Access file you probably don't</font>

2306
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:15,260
have access to httpd com but you can

2307
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:18,050
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an H dot HT Access file and</font>

2308
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:19,760
actually turn it up there are some

2309
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,590
hosting providers though that actually

2310
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,240
have compiled their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apache which is</font>

2311
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:25,190
normally bad because they're behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

2312
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:27,230
security updates so you shouldn't use

2313
01:36:25,190 --> 01:36:28,429
them for that reason and also sometimes

2314
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:29,660
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little pushback because</font>

2315
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,920
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like but we give you unlimited</font>

2316
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:34,130
bandwidth why do you care about

2317
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:36,800
compression but I find you you normally

2318
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:42,380
can and if they tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no go find</font>

2319
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:44,000
somewhere yeah no no you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> UM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

2320
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can help you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix that</font>

2321
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should go to zoom and get a report</font>

2322
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:50,450
no tell you gotta fix it um but mod

2323
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,890
basically your standard things you

2324
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:54,410
should get with apache on any hosting

2325
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:56,390
environment even virtual should be mod

2326
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:58,809
deflate which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk and mon expires</font>

2327
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:04,810
which allows you to do HTTP caching

2328
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:04,810
right how far over did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go 45 minutes</font>
