1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
three basic files you have on your

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,430
system or folder that actually is on the

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,170
system this is the catalog that has all

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,269
your metadata in it the dates<font color="#E5E5E5"> and time</font>

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,450
stamps and in some cases can contain a

6
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,370
file if the file is below like 930 one

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,288
bites or so they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually fit in the</font>

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,090
mft and you would lose these small text

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,820
files or these small files without this

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,380
database the other stuff I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,510
care too much about till I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,210
one called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bitmap file the bitmap</font>

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,880
file tells me all the thought all the

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,500
allocated space on the disk this is this

15
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,620
is the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between I am not using</font>

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,079
a 500 gig hard drive I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> only using 120</font>

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,419
gigs of a 500 gig hard drive this bitmap

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,340
file basically tells you that so if you

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,260
knew that you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and only</font>

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,600
copy the hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty gigs and not</font>

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,329
care about the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 400 gigs you</font>

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,000
didn't yet so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately we can skip</font>

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,649
but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about and this is what</font>

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,620
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would look like if I took that file</font>

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,449
that mft<font color="#E5E5E5"> file and I parsed it into a</font>

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,550
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see things like this</font>

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,379
this is what my file is is it good what

28
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,358
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what folder does it point to</font>

29
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,670
what's its parent and all of its other

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,049
metadata information this is what I'm

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,580
going to focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what I'm</font>

32
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after and forget about</font>

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,070
looking at every single sector so the

34
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,200
badly fragmented stuff if you really

35
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,298
look at this picture you'll see like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,310
I only cared about the allocated stuff I

37
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,810
only need to copy these sectors that are

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,790
touched or something that I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

39
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,290
things like unallocated and all this

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,330
white space and stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here I</font>

41
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,460
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skip that but I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

42
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,710
exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> those sectors are that I</font>

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,380
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy so there's a tool now that</font>

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,809
does that so here's the concept

45
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,149
basically I've got a tool that's going

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,890
to image the MBR and this tool is kind

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,020
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doss based tool so it doesn't run</font>

48
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,909
in windows it's actually talking through

49
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,850
hardware directly to the hard drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

50
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,960
it runs in boss so I don't have windows

51
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,579
and I don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capability of</font>

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,110
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really nice GUI so</font>

53
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,270
what ends up happening is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

54
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,679
have to if I image the MBR and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,149
look at it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that drug</font>

56
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,369
to a windows machine and look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,189
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and</font>

58
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,439
run and continue this process so I'm

59
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,389
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to image the MBR it's going to</font>

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,128
tell me what my part a chamar partition

61
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,869
tables are it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

62
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,510
partition tables and it's going to image

63
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,170
either I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do just the mft or I can</font>

64
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,970
do the bitmap

65
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,160
I can do boast I can basically say just

66
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,930
give me allocated files not all this

67
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,239
unallocated stuff I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about and</font>

68
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,610
then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use windows to select</font>

69
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,640
the folders I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

70
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,380
actually say I only want this guy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> My</font>

71
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">Documents folder and not have to choose</font>

72
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,519
anything else and only image just those

73
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,260
sectors skipping fragmentation skipping

74
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,910
all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and have won</font>

75
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,280
consecutive file that actually makes

76
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,260
sense I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to image it and then I'm</font>

77
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to restore just those files so I'm</font>

78
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,980
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to be surgical and give you</font>

79
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,290
a demo of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happening so</font>

80
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,329
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box i'm using it's called a</font>

81
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">DTR disk imager and this is really the</font>

82
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">first time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really done one of these</font>

83
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,569
hacker talks that's on a specific piece

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
of hardware it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good concept tool</font>

85
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,560
though it does a lot of diagnostics and

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,390
a lot of other things so I think that

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is really important and it would be</font>

88
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know great to kind of expand upon</font>

89
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,670
all the features and maybe at some point

90
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,518
in time other tools will do something

91
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar but but this is a fantastic tool</font>

92
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,940
it's not cheap though it's about 3,500

93
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,560
but if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a data</font>

94
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,299
recovery business this will pay for

95
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,160
itself in two or three recoveries you'll

96
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,810
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done not to mention that if you're</font>

97
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,579
doing something in an organization where

98
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">Time Matters you know you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on an oil</font>

99
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,900
rig and you have one hour to do a

100
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,459
recovery this will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process that</font>

101
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,049
will basically save your life in a

102
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,299
situation where you know maybe they

103
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,410
didn't have a backup so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

104
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you a demo now so I'm gonna switch</font>

105
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,950
to the machines

106
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,790
yeah yeah okay

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,929
at the vet map no there is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft the</font>

108
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:05,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">mft doesn't ah my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machines now shutting</font>

109
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:08,660
down isn't that great<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so while</font>

110
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:11,640
that removes the so what he said is that

111
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a backup of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mft there's not</font>

112
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,389
actually a backup of the MST itself the

113
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">mft there is a MFT mirror and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mft</font>

114
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,150
mirror is only the first four records

115
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,250
it's basically located the center of the

116
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">disk minus a couple of bites and</font>

117
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,660
basically it is a pointer back to the

118
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,070
original records of where the beginnings

119
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,990
of directors are it's basically for

120
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,219
single sector failure to basically get

121
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,110
rid of the fact that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a single</font>

122
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,260
sector that failed I can at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

123
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> records that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about and point</font>

124
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,780
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them but that's that's about it</font>

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,180
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a complete backup so if you end</font>

126
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,210
up like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft being a small database or</font>

127
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,190
something basically if you needed to it

128
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,859
would be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small in nature it would</font>

129
00:04:53,190 --> 00:05:03,840
be you know maybe 300 megs or something

130
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:05,789
for a very large drive so so what I'm

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,900
using here basically if this thing comes

132
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">up fast enough I can show you I've got</font>

133
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,060
this box in this box this black box is

134
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,039
just in a regular computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this box</font>

135
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,500
is the boot drive it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

136
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,780
boot device for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer there is no</font>

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,760
windows drive there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no other drive it</font>

138
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:28,409
is a flash device and it is the boot

139
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:30,810
device and this boot device this boot

140
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,680
device is then connected to the source

141
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:37,490
drive whatever the bad drive is and let

142
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,490
me see if I can show you what it is

143
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,490
yeah well videos not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

144
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Corsi something always blows up all</font>

145
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not critical anyway so</font>

146
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,960
basically I've got a source device on

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,819
this left-hand side and I've got a

148
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,799
destination drive on the right hand side

149
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,680
where I'm going to clone my data to and

150
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,569
so this black box is the boot device and

151
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,610
so it boots and when it boots it looks

152
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,219
like this now this device can do a

153
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,780
couple of things but basically can do

154
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,310
some diagnostics and stuff i'm not going

155
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,188
to go too far<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that but i'm going to</font>

156
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,430
apply power on this box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this box</font>

157
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,379
will start up and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin by</font>

158
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,960
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mount the drive it does not</font>

159
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,909
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically still a read-only</font>

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,529
device all it's going to do is look

161
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,680
physically at the device itself and see

162
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:34,740
if there's a if it can actually seek the

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,509
drive so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hit f11 you'll actually</font>

164
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,310
see it like come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll go busy in</font>

165
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:39,629
the top corner and then it'll come to

166
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,699
drive see complete and drive ready

167
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:43,710
that's typically a good signal to me

168
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,639
it's kind of like a modem<font color="#E5E5E5"> a courier</font>

169
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,620
modem or something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually</font>

170
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,539
come back and tell you my drive is

171
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,009
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with and I</font>

172
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,568
can do other things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually have</font>

173
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,639
like an oscilloscope monitor that I can

174
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,810
monitor the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and 12 volt current so I</font>

175
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,029
can see what kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

176
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,560
happening on the device so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

177
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,750
actually see it during its power cycle

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,460
when it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on spindle spins up</font>

179
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,680
and heads move and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

180
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,330
PCB board actually has a processor just

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,839
locked on it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell a lot of</font>

182
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that normally at this point</font>

183
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,969
I would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a list of the</font>

184
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,500
drives I can see my source drive the

185
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:17,669
serial numbers and LBA numbers are

186
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,379
really good signs that means at least

187
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,359
the drive can mount even if I have a lot

188
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,189
of damage I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that the</font>

189
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,689
device is physically working even if

190
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,699
I've had to repair it or something to

191
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:29,009
get to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now what I'm going</font>

192
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,599
to do is start<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it knows</font>

193
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,250
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no configuration so I've</font>

194
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,650
got actually go through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of</font>

195
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,469
well do I want an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

196
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,849
focus on that particular item there is

197
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,580
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> item on the menu that's called data</font>

198
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:44,729
and I can select<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area that I want to</font>

199
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,818
image so this is completely for dealing

200
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:50,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this mft all I want to do is copy</font>

201
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,039
the MBR and the catalog for the

202
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,330
partition that I want that's it I don't

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,250
want anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point I don't</font>

204
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,258
want any files I don't want to recover

205
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,360
anything all I want to do is copy save

206
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,490
this small 300 Meg database off of the

207
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,510
computer so when I select my imaging

208
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,790
area you

209
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,140
see it will initialize a map the<font color="#E5E5E5"> map is</font>

210
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,390
actually being written on the

211
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,560
destination disk it's not being written

212
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:16,469
on the originals not making any changes

213
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,180
to it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not spin right so so so it is</font>

214
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,190
writing all of its configuration

215
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,080
information on the destination disk so

216
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,850
it made a small amount and now it's

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,859
telling me oh look I've identified from

218
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,560
the MBR that I have a partition and I

219
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,510
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> select that partition once I select</font>

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,299
the partition now I'm saying well what

221
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,979
do I want what do I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get normally</font>

222
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,469
I might say I want something like all

223
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,880
files and bitmaps from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft record</font>

224
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,740
because that's basically what I would

225
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
focus on but then I could whittle it

226
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,820
down from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but that's all I want</font>

227
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,360
this machine to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do at the moment is to</font>

228
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,190
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grab this particular item so when</font>

229
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,960
i hit enter it's going to actually read

230
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,000
just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft from the drive and nothing</font>

231
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,370
else so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start cloning the</font>

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">mft wherever those components are and</font>

233
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,490
you like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it fly through the whole</font>

234
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,680
drive and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ooh look i copied the mft</font>

235
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,320
and I got the bitmap file so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got those</font>

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,120
two things that's all I want from the

237
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,450
drive at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time now that's</font>

238
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,850
cloned to the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

239
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,010
destination disk if i was using windows

240
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,010
and i plug this drive into a windows

241
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,960
machine the MBR basically tells windows

242
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,850
the master boot record tells windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

243
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,620
got a partition and it's an NTFS

244
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,300
partition please mount me look at my

245
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,100
files and that causes that little bar to

246
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,630
spin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at all your files and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

247
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,610
give you a list that you can actually do

248
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">something with I don't want windows to</font>

249
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,720
look at this there are no files on this

250
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,660
machine if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive</font>

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a old data or something else it</font>

252
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,230
was corrupt data we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

253
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">to blue screen right so I don't want</font>

254
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,770
windows to look at it so we have a

255
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,840
function in here that basically turns

256
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,550
off the MBR turns off the partition

257
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,170
table so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who know what I'm</font>

258
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,260
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it the end of a partition</font>

259
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,630
table you have the two bytes 55 AAA well

260
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,450
it basically changes it to 55 BB so that

261
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,810
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no partition flag so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

262
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go</font>
