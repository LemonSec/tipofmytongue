year of do 2010 the year of do so the

87
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that for a theme</font>

88
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,619
this year is at the hacker consortium in

89
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,749
Nashville we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad case of</font>

90
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:58,249
wind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be cool if we have a lot of</font>

91
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:00,229
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone says oh man wouldn't</font>

92
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">be cool if we did so and so or hey man</font>

93
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't be cool if we did this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

94
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,789
and the other got together<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

95
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:06,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">blah blah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> blah but unfortunately what</font>

96
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,419
ends up happening is you come up with

97
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:11,119
these great ideas or you collaborate at

98
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,378
a con or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you hang</font>

99
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,759
out with pres Mike and you want to see

100
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:17,360
how much alcohol you can pump into a

101
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,649
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> that size um but when it's what</font>

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,939
ends up happening is everyone makes

103
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:21,649
these great plans and then you go home

104
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:24,199
from the con and then you never really

105
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:28,429
do any of those things so I picked 20

106
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,110
tears the 2010 is the year of do because

107
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,179
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about time we laid some things</font>

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,949
happen you know you got all these people

109
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:37,128
sitting around you can collaborate with

110
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:39,110
let's face it outer zone is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> def</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> con</font>

111
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:42,279
it's not shmoocon it's not another kind

112
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,719
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a double negative so anyway</font>

113
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,939
we're completely different the reason is

114
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:48,979
there's you know 100 hundred or so

115
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,959
people in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room that have signed up</font>

116
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:52,128
somewhere around that I'd have you count

117
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,360
but unless someone's going to screw that

118
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:58,669
up so the the real draw on appeal of

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,039
outer zone is you can come to our con

120
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:02,508
and in the weekend get completely

121
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,849
trashed with every<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in this room</font>

122
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,860
at Def Con<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have 8,500 people</font>

123
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,079
wandering around you could miss your

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,089
your best friend you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know all weekend</font>

125
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,800
long never see them no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how hard</font>

126
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:17,809
you try so outer zone actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,129
started by a few people<font color="#CCCCCC"> praise mike was</font>

128
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:23,660
one of them lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> merlin myself and</font>

129
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:26,810
another guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I don't ever talk to</font>

130
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,230
we love you Joe bastard so we started

131
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,970
this con kind of to snub our nose at a

132
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,980
gentleman who had another com called

133
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Interzone yes there is kind of a joke</font>

134
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:39,770
based on the name there I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,040
we used that but um we started this con

136
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,680
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a Fleming our nose to him and</font>

137
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,640
everyone kept saying hey we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

138
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,890
next year right so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are six six</font>

141
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:02,390

makes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money but they're in the</font>

164
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,560
business of getting a large number of

165
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,620
hackers together so I don't fault them

166
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,359
for that about 140<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks is pretty</font>

vehicle and you know they're crashing on

170
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,550
someone's floor so every dollar that you

00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,729
some cash in the bucket if you feel it's

178

interested in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff i do then go</font>

281
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,800
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that later and sign up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

282
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,370
class or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta</font>

283
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,099
class like in July<font color="#E5E5E5"> June or July next</font>

284
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,100
month it'll be in DC so so keep track of

285
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,480
that but I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fill you with</font>

286
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,010
any plot for anything I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going I'm</font>

287
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically do the real meat and</font>

288
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,390
potatoes now this is because the land is

289
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,920
my hometown here this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the only</font>

290
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,689
cons that I'm actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do like</font>

291
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,370
real live demo I brought a whole bunch

292
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hardware and I've set it up mainly</font>

293
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,140
because in the last 30 days there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

294
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">a new release some software there's a</font>

295
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,890
new process<font color="#E5E5E5"> where basically now people</font>

296
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,350
are starting to try to focus on

297
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:13,110
integrating the logical recovery with

298
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,690
the physical recovery and for anybody do

299
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,450
forensics<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me people do in forensics</font>

300
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,880
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people make images like DD or</font>

301
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,250
ftk or does anything to make images of

302
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,140
hard drives so you guys know at this

303
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,810
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you've been doing images</font>

304
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,939
you're doing basically whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

305
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,060
drive will respond to through either the

306
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,670
API through windows or whatever whatever

307
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,469
problem it has you may still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have while</font>

308
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,449
you're doing DD or trying to deal with

309
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,860
physical images doing even ftk and

310
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,380
things like that very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pieces</font>

311
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,180
of software do anything with control of

312
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing and typically when you're looking</font>

313
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,750
at problems on drives once you get

314
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,280
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like six hundred</font>

315
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,630
millisecond response times you may

316
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,760
actually be able to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sector's</font>

317
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,950
but windows isn't going to respond to it

318
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,270
and several the other file systems and

319
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,700
operating systems aren't going to

320
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,050
respond to it so I have a piece of

321
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,090
hardware that's called the deeps bar

322
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,030
disk imager which is hardware with

323
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,310
software and so so basically at this

324
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,170
point in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 30 days I'm running on</font>

325
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,109
beta code I mean literally beta code

326
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:15,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was released like Thursday so I</font>

327
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,950
tested it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday to make sure that what</font>

328
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,990
I had was still up to snuff and was

329
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,370
still working so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to demo</font>

330
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,050
something that I think is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

331
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,850
where we're now leaving just the

332
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,770
physical image component where we

333
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,180
normally deal with sectors so if you

334
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,810
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about how repaired</font>

335
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draw</font>

336
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before I got here I'm not</font>

337
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,079
doing that today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing now I've</font>

338
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,820
actually done head replacements or apply

339
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">to replacements and move the content and</font>

340
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,270
now I'm actually going to have problems

341
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,560
image in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the constant problem that</font>

342
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,360
you will have like you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

343
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,130
good drives when you're using DD and

344
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,900
you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftk imager if they have a</font>

345
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,060
problem they typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop you get a</font>

346
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">little thermometer bar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not indeedy</font>

347
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,510
but you little thermometer bar and then

348
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">BAM it's dead if there's a problem it</font>

349
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,180
doesn't continue on and you've got to

350
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what happened or where it</font>

351
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,510
left off or if it can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if has one bad</font>

352
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,520
sector maybe you'll make it through it

353
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:00,480
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got you know two million bad</font>

354
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,529
sectors you're not going to make it

355
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> an image and you're not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

356
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">get anything reliable so that's where</font>

357
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,510
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting with two million bad</font>

358
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,430
sectors on drives that really are

359
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:10,980
damaged and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get the</font>

360
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,599
data off of those types of sectors so so

361
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to actually have to</font>

362
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,660
do a head replacement or a platter

363
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,100
replacement to get a motor running to

364
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,930
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heads actually working again or</font>

365
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,730
resolder<font color="#E5E5E5"> abort to actually repair it and</font>

366
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,589
get it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> but most of the time after</font>

367
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do that there would be no possible way</font>

368
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,820
for me to use a piece of software to

369
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">make an image it would die there anytime</font>

370
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,370
you do a head replacement you're going

371
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,350
to have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a misalignment</font>

372
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,150
no matter what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you might not be</font>

373
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to read every single sector so</font>

374
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,709
that's bad news so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a special</font>

375
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,140
imager that you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as a bit</font>

torrent for a hard drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it</font>

377
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,640
takes a sector and it treats it as a

has to read it again after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on the ones that are</font>

383
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,630
problem areas and go back and whittle

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,270
this down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller and smaller</font>

386
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,079
it in there's ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that forwards</font>

backwards turn off cash turn on cash

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,500
change ECC things like that I'm not

imaging so so kind of my disclaimer is

418
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,900
this is beta<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bought a bunch of</font>

419
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,030
hardware in the last 24 hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

420
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,920
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plugged it in so I have no</font>

421
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,080
backup here I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no if something blows</font>

422
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,510
up there's no extra hard drives there's

423
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,280
no extra laptop and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push it</font>

424
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,250
pretty hard in an hour to get this done

425
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,980
so so crap can happen and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on</font>

426
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,450
beta code so just so you know I can do

427
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,740
it I've tested it I've done data

428
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,550
recoveries with it already in the last

429
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,590
30 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if smoke comes out that's</font>

430
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,669
the way it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

431
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,080
kind of my whole point I'm trying to

432
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,450
make normally you're used to doing a

433
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,889
sequential traditional based imaging

434
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,050
method where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got to read a drive</font>

435
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,700
from beginning to end and usually have

436
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,590
to do it in one pass you have to get it

437
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,510
done or it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete you can't do</font>

438
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything with it and so this is where</font>

439
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,840
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of get away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

440
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,010
that because trying to carve files just

441
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work for the most part you're</font>

442
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,710
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lose stuff even the MFD itself</font>

443
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,540
contains files in it so basically this

444
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,850
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're looking at if you have</font>

445
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,290
done carving or you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not get a</font>

446
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,879
complete copy or driving you try to

447
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,720
carve stuff off these are the kind of

448
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,280
things you're missing you're missing

449
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,230
first thing you're gonna lose a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

450
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,660
time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of hardware can actually</font>

451
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,040
control power and it can also decide to

452
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,080
turn off the hard drive when there's a

453
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,149
failure turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> back on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and restart from</font>

454
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,710
another location so it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually turn</font>

455
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,030
the power off and do things so it's

456
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,910
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to automate this</font>

457
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,800
process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can go home small files</font>

458
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists in mft you would lose you</font>

459
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,250
lose fragmented files fragmented files

460
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,690
are our biggest nightmare if you have a

461
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,570
big database you're trying to recover it

462
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,860
or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video it's dead you can't recover</font>

463
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,590
the whole thing it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work</font>

464
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,000
so then you also have sparse files which

465
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,800
are basically kind of compressed files

466
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,910
by the operating system you would lose

467
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,860
those you wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

468
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,690
recover them completely there would be

469
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,000
empty space that's not separated

470
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,860
correctly and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

471
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you've got media damage</font>

472
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,090
you've got head damage on a drive and it

473
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,980
basically whacked the platter that there

474
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,959
will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a spot that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is damaged and if</font>

475
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,670
you keep grinding on that sector like

476
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,410
some of the other software does to try

477
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,290
to read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sector's it'll actually</font>

478
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,700
start digging

479
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,950
head into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that location on the platter</font>

480
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,960
doing more damage so my whole goal would

481
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,490
be to skip that what if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font>

482
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,260
those files what if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

483
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:04,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece since our traditional thing has</font>

484
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,400
been to image the drive from beginning

485
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,620
to end well what if we decided I've got

486
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mft which is a database on my</font>

487
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,570
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this database says what my</font>

488
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,220
files are it will tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> where my files</font>

489
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,470
are and what they are in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> directory</font>

490
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,870
structure so if I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose what I</font>

491
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,910
want I can be surgical in removing the

492
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,949
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I care about so let me give</font>

493
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:28,690
you kind of an example if I had a 60 gig

494
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,830
hard drive I've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> copy 117 million</font>

495
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,930
sectors in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complete</font>

496
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,090
recovery but what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documents in</font>

497
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">the documents in settings folder for my</font>

498
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,949
user was only two million sectors then I

499
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,980
could do two million sectors instead of

500
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,870
doing 117 million so I can cut that way

501
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,820
down so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I'm looking at here</font>

502
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,219
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who have done any kind of</font>

503
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,360
software or data recovery or use the

504
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,910
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software that's looked at</font>

505
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,800
forensics software you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have basically</font>

506
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,920
these metadata files that are on your

507
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,870
computer on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntfs drive and the ones</font>

508
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,610
that are important basically for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is</font>

509
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,159
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be primarily going to be this</font>

510
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,959
one here called dollar mft and so

511
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft likes to begin all of their</font>

512
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,750
metadata files with dollars in it's

513
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,490
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft likes dollars but</font>

514
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,900
outside of that these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

515
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care about now this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

516
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,040
basically telling you what these files

517
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,510
are and the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want you to note</font>

518
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,139
is that the master file table basically

519
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,940
contains a 1k record for every basic

520
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,320
files you have on your system or folder

521
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,270
that actually is on the system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

522
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,520
the catalog that has all your metadata

523
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,680
in it the dates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> time stamps and in</font>

524
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,410
some cases can contain a file if the

525
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,540
files below like 930 one bites or so

526
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,100
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually fit in the mft and you</font>

527
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,280
would lose these small text files or

528
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,629
these small files without this database

529
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,160
the other stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

530
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,950
much about till I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this one called</font>

531
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,230
the bitmap file the bitmap file tells me

532
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,510
all the thought all the allocated space

533
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,940
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk this is this is the</font>

534
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,220
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between I am not using a 500</font>

535
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,830
gig hard drive I'm only using 120 gigs

536
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,990
of a 500 gig hard drive this bitmap file

537
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,000
basically tells you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so if you knew</font>

538
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,830
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and only copy</font>

539
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,960
the hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty gigs and not</font>

540
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about the rest of that 400 gigs you</font>

541
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,240
didn't get so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately we can skip</font>

542
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care about and this is</font>

543
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,980
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like if I took that</font>

544
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,659
file that mft<font color="#E5E5E5"> file and I parsed it into</font>

545
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,940
a database<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see things like this</font>

546
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,740
this is what my file is is it good what

547
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it what folder does it point to</font>

548
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,029
what's its parent and all of its other

549
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,409
metadata information this is what I'm

550
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,940
going to focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is what I'm</font>

551
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:35,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after and forget about</font>

552
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,460
looking at every single sector so the

553
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,500
badly fragmented stuff if you really

554
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,690
look at this picture you'll see like if

555
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I only cared about the allocated stuff I</font>

556
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,169
only need to copy these sectors that are

557
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:47,179
touched or something that I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

558
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,679
things like unallocated and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

559
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,720
white space and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in here I</font>

560
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,820
could just skip that but I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

561
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,100
exactly what<font color="#CCCCCC"> those sectors are that I</font>

562
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,740
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy so there's a tool now that</font>

563
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,230
does that so here's the concept

564
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,720
basically I've got a tool it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

565
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,399
image the MBR and this tool is kind of a

566
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,409
Doss based tool so it doesn't run<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

567
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:08,268
windows it's actually talking through

568
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,210
hardware directly to the hard drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

569
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:12,350
it runs in Doss so I don't have windows

570
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,120
and I don't have the capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

571
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,590
running some really nice GUI so what

572
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,750
ends up happening is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

573
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,309
to if I image the MBR and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

574
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,200
at it I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that drive to a</font>

575
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:23,299
windows machine and look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then</font>

576
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,730
I can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this machine and run</font>

577
00:23:23,299 --> 00:23:28,190
and continue this process so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

578
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,110
to image the MBR it's going to tell me

579
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:31,970
what my part a chamar partition tables

580
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,100
are it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take this partition</font>

581
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,080
tables and it's going to image either I

582
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do just the MST or i can do the</font>

583
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,370
bitmap<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do both I can basically say</font>

584
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,809
just give me allocated files not all

585
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,120
this unallocated stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care</font>

586
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:46,730
about and then i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use windows</font>

587
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,649
to select the folders I care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so I</font>

588
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,409
could actually say I only want this

589
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:53,029
guy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> My Documents folder and not have</font>

590
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,649
to choose anything else and only image

591
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:56,690
just those sectors skipping

592
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:58,549
fragmentation skipping all the other

593
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,889
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have won consecutive file</font>

594
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:02,149
that actually makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

595
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,010
image it and then I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restore</font>

596
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,840
just those files so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try to</font>

597
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,389
be surgical and give you a demo of that

598
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box</font>

599
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:12,469
i'm using it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DTR disk imager</font>

600
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,178
and this is really the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

601
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,010
really done one of these hacker talks

602
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:18,620
that's on a specific piece of hardware

603
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,020
it's a good concept tool though it does

604
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,060
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diagnostics</font>

605
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,860
a lot of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

606
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,929
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

607
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,669
you know great to kind of expand upon

608
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,050
all the features and maybe at some point

609
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,900
in time other tools will do something

610
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar but but this is a fantastic tool</font>

611
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,320
it's not cheap though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 3,500</font>

612
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,909
but if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a data</font>

613
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,649
recovery business this will pay for

614
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,540
itself in two or three recoveries you'll

615
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:42,160
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done not to mention that if you're</font>

616
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,960
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something in an organization where</font>

617
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Time Matters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're on an oil</font>

618
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,100
rig and you have one hour to do a

619
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,840
recovery this will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process that</font>

620
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">will basically save your life in a</font>

621
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,649
situation where you know maybe they

622
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,940
didn't have a backup so so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

623
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you a demo now someone switched to</font>

624
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,330
the machines

625
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,830
yeah yeah

626
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,168
ok

627
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,980
no there is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft the mft doesn't ah</font>

628
00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:28,460
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shutting down isn't</font>

629
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,019
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> great all right so while that</font>

630
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,999
reboots the so what he said is that

631
00:25:32,019 --> 00:25:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a backup of the mft there's not</font>

632
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:41,749
actually a backup of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft itself the</font>

633
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">mft there is a MFT mirror and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mft</font>

634
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:47,539
mirror is only the first four records

635
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,610
it's basically located the center of the

636
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:51,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk minus a couple of bites and</font>

637
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:54,049
basically it is a pointer back to the

638
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:55,460
original records of where the beginnings

639
00:25:54,049 --> 00:25:57,350
of directors are it's basically for

640
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,580
single sector failure to basically get

641
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,498
rid of the fact that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font>

642
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,619
sector that failed I can at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

643
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:06,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> records that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I cared about and point</font>

644
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:09,139
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but that's that's about it</font>

645
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,539
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a complete backup so if you end</font>

646
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:14,539
up like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft being a small database or</font>

647
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:16,549
something basically if you needed to it

648
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,220
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small in nature it would</font>

649
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:27,200
be you know maybe 300 megs or something

650
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:29,149
for a very large drive so so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

651
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,289
using here basically if this thing comes

652
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:35,600
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast enough I can show you I've got</font>

653
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:38,450
this box in this box this black box is

654
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,399
just in a regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer and this box</font>

655
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,859
is the boot drive it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the</font>

656
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,869
boot device for the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no</font>

657
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:47,119
windows drive there is no other drive it

658
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:51,769
is a flash device and it is the boot

659
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:54,168
device and this boot device this boot

660
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:58,039
device is then connected to the source

661
00:26:54,169 --> 00:27:00,850
drive whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad drive is and let</font>

662
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,850
me see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I can show you what it is</font>

663
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,870
yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> video is not coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

664
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,990
Corsi something always goes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

665
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,150
so that's not critical anyway so

666
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,310
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a source device on</font>

667
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,170
this left-hand side and I've got a

668
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,149
destination drive on the right hand side

669
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,030
where I'm going to clone my data to and

670
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:29,920
so this black box is the boot device and

671
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,960
so it boots and when it boots it looks

672
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,600
like this now this device can do a

673
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,130
couple of things but basically it can do

674
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,659
some diagnostics and stuff i'm not going

675
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,570
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> too far into that but i'm going to</font>

676
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply power on this box and this box</font>

677
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,760
will start up and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin by</font>

678
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,340
trying to mount the drive it does not

679
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,260
it's it's basically still a read-only

680
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,909
device all it's going to do is look

681
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:55,060
physically at the device itself and see

682
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:58,090
if there's a if it can actually seek the

683
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,889
drive so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hit f11 you'll actually</font>

684
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,689
see it like come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and we'll go busy in</font>

685
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,010
the top corner and then it'll come to

686
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,080
drive see complete and drive ready

687
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,060
that's typically a good signal to me

688
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,020
it's kind of like a modem a courier

689
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,970
modem or something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually</font>

690
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,920
come back and tell you my drive is

691
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,360
actually ready to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and I</font>

692
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,950
can do other things like I actually have

693
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,020
like an oscilloscope monitor that I can

694
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,040
monitor the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and 12 volt current so I</font>

695
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,410
can see what kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

696
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening on the device so you can</font>

697
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,130
actually see it during its power cycle

698
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,810
when it comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on spindle spins up</font>

699
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,850
and heads move and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the</font>

700
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,470
PCB board actually has a processor

701
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's locked on it so I can tell a lot</font>

702
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:35,350
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that normally at this</font>

703
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,320
point I would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a list of</font>

704
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,850
the drives I can see my source drive the

705
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,020
serial numbers and LBA numbers are

706
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,760
really good signs that means at least

707
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,740
the drive can mount even if I have a lot

708
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,540
of damage I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that the</font>

709
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,070
device is physically working even if

710
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,080
I've had to repair it or something to

711
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:52,389
get to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now what I'm going</font>

712
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,980
to do is start<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it knows</font>

713
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's no configuration so I've</font>

714
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,970
got actually go through this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

715
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,850
well do I want an<font color="#E5E5E5"> mft so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

716
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,230
focus on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular item there is</font>

717
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,959
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> item on the menu that's called data</font>

718
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,080
and I can select<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area that I want to</font>

719
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,170
image so this is completely for dealing

720
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this mft all I want to do is copy</font>

721
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,390
the MBR and the catalog for the

722
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,710
partition that I want that's it I don't

723
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,600
want anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

724
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,640
want any files I don't want to recover

725
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,740
anything all I want to do is copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> save</font>

726
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,870
the small 300 Meg database off of the

727
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,830
computer so let us select my imaging

728
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:29,139
area you

729
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,490
see it will initialize a map<font color="#E5E5E5"> the map is</font>

730
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,740
actually being written on the

731
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,880
destination disk it's not being written

732
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:39,070
on the original it's not making<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

733
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:41,019
changes to it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not spin right so so</font>

734
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,580
so it is writing all of its

735
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:44,200
configuration information on the

736
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,178
destination disk so it made a small

737
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,070
amount and now it's telling me oh look

738
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:49,840
I've identified from the MBR that I have

739
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,450
a partition and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> select that</font>

740
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,879
partition once I select the partition

741
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,159
now I'm saying well what do I want what

742
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,080
do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get normally I might say I</font>

743
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:01,179
want something like all files and

744
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,740
bitmaps from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft record because</font>

745
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:04,539
that's basically what I would focus on

746
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,340
but then I could whittle it down from

747
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:09,490
there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all I want this machine</font>

748
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do at the moment is to go and grab</font>

749
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,380
this particular item so when i hit enter

750
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,450
it's going to actually read just the MFD

751
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,190
from the drive and nothing else so it's

752
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start cloning the mft wherever</font>

753
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,519
those components are and you like to see

754
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,380
it fly through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole drive and say</font>

755
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,740
ooh look i copied the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mft and I got the</font>

756
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,269
bitmap file so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got those two things</font>

757
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,970
that's all I want from the drive at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

758
00:30:28,269 --> 00:30:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time now that's cloned to the</font>

759
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:36,340
destination disk<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the destination</font>

760
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,350
disk if i was using windows and i plug

761
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,990
this drive into a windows machine the

762
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,490
MBR basically tells windows the master

763
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,380
boot record tells windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a</font>

764
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,510
partition and it's an NTFS partition

765
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,370
please mount me look at my files and

766
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,690
that causes that little bar to spin and

767
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,979
look at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your files and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then give you</font>

768
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,960
a list that you can actually do

769
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">something with I don't want windows to</font>

770
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,070
look at this there are no files on this

771
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:59,769
machine if I had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive</font>

772
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a old data or something else</font>

773
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:03,220
that was corrupt data it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

774
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:05,019
cause windows to blue screen right so I

775
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,519
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want windows to look at it so we</font>

776
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:08,769
have a function in here that basically

777
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:10,570
turns off the MBR turns off the

778
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,130
partition table so those of you who know

779
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,049
what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it the end of a</font>

780
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,570
partition table you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two bytes</font>

781
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:19,389
55 AAA well it basically changes it to

782
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,730
55<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB so that there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no partition flag</font>

783
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:24,039
so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to my destination</font>

784
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,260
disk then I'm going to deactivate the

785
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,929
MBR this is basically so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

786
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,450
doesn't blow up so I deactivate it it

787
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:34,409
turns it off and now i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just</font>

788
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,409
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

789
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,340
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to do is now I have</font>

790
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,470
this catalog I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take my actual</font>

791
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,449
destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk and I'm going to take</font>

792
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:56,700
my destination disk off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

793
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:58,410
and i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plug it into windows so</font>

794
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,950
let's see if this switches screens

795
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,950
correctly

796
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now I've got it plugged into</font>

797
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,950
Windows and Windows wouldn't be able to

798
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">see anything basically all I would see</font>

799
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:28,029
at this point well if it comes up

800
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,370
if the drive initializes and shows up

801
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:45,460
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so but so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I how an</font>

802
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,860
uninitialized is no MBR and it just has

803
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,060
just the all unallocated space but the

804
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,340
piece of software that goes with this

805
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,230
device knows that I have a table and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

806
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,550
knows where this table is so what I

807
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,130
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do now this will look</font>

808
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,180
a little beta and so you visual basic

809
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,660
people will kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know what I'm</font>

810
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,660
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font>

811
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,320
um

812
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,410
yeah it's USB<font color="#E5E5E5"> external hard drive</font>

813
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,570
for that for the imager the imager talks

814
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,880
through all the ATA commands and

815
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:34,899
actually does all the work at the at the

816
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,970
actual imager level itself the this now

817
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,740
i'm actually just using windows all it's

818
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,360
going to do is read this table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

819
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,010
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be looking at this table so</font>

820
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,189
this thing starts up is called image

821
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,870
explorer now here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its really beta so</font>

822
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:51,370
here's the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

823
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:56,050
create a no I did not build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is</font>

824
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:58,719
actually part of the deeps bar stuff so

825
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:00,940
I have this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Explorer and</font>

826
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,890
basically it sees the two hard drives in

827
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list when I hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two hard drives</font>

828
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,220
is going to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will see that</font>

829
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,480
there's a partition and now I can

830
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,550
actually do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's called</font>

831
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,679
scanned file system all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

832
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,600
looks at all my mft records over here on

833
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,210
the right and it's building me a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

834
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,949
and then once it's done i'll actually be

835
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,629
able to go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the table and</font>

836
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:21,009
now you'll actually see all the

837
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,889
directories that are on this damage

838
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:28,030

data only the catalog nothing else so

840
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,330
you know as you're looking down the list

841
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,520
and you see something you care about so

842
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,918
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say into the documents and</font>

00:34:54,250 --> 00:35:00,850
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let's see what else we got so</font>

851

<font color="#CCCCCC">right so so I've selected some porn off</font>

853
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,210
his computer I don't want the window

854
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,830
system folder I don't want and allocate

855
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,560
it I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want anything else all i care</font>

856
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,960
about are these folders<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

857
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,130
important stuff important the important

858
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,450
what's that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be able to export</font>

859
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,070
them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to look at them</font>

860
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,290
but what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen now is I have</font>

861
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,350
to update the catalog i have to say hey

862
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:28,690
give me a catalog and put it on this

863
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,610
device so i'm a selected for imaging so

864
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,970
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what this nail does is</font>

865
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,280
it will go through 357 commands now is

866
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:37,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to add them to the list and it's</font>

867
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,440
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to crawl through it and it's</font>

868
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,359
update it you can see it doing the list

869
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,240
actually right there processing and then

870
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,089
it's done so it's selected them all so

871
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,149
now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to do imma save my</font>

872
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:52,180
project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to close and then</font>

873
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,290
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to unmount this disk</font>

874
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:58,759
which probably won't do anything because

875
00:35:54,290 --> 00:36:04,490
there's no OS on it so I'm turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

876
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:07,010
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then i take this again my</font>

877
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:11,149
destination disk i'm connecting it back

878
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:15,080
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and I will turn this</font>

879
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:16,190
thing on now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switch back to</font>

880
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:23,509
that machine so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what I'm</font>

881
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:26,500
doing next what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I never did</font>

882
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,500
get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera working again</font>

883
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,040
alright so now the machines booted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

884
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:39,690
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run my application</font>

885
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:44,140
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the hardware and yeah</font>

886
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:45,670
then this I'm hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Earth 11 to turn</font>

887
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:47,440
the power on this device will now turn

888
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power on then keep in mind that</font>

889
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,200
there's like all these functions that

890
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,090
have existed on this thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

891
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,649
three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we got this far that</font>

892
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:56,170
does whole bunches of other things

893
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,850
images<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Reverse skip stuff does all</font>

894
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,830
kinds of damaged areas I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

895
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,210
focus on what these files are and if

896
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,250
there's damage in other places on the

897
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,140
drive that because ftk wouldn't make it

898
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,940
through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop it would die in all</font>

899
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,140
the all the unallocated space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

900
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other stuff I would normally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

901
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:18,069
copy so so now i have my device selected

902
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:20,230
and so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i still have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same status</font>

903
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was on my device before</font>

904
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,160
is still there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can basically do an</font>

905
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,540
imaging job<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like you can't do</font>

906
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,790
this with FD k you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like stop</font>

907
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:30,310
and come back later so i can actually

908
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:32,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop an image in process put it on the</font>

909
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:34,270
shelf do another<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the two back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

910
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,279
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the configuration that comes from the</font>

911
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,960
destination drive will maintain all the

912
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,580
status information for everything

913
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,410
anything that's already been copied it

914
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,580
will never do again anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

915
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:44,770
to be copied it will still have a table

916
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:47,020
too but<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now it just has a table</font>

917
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,200
that basically says<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to image all</font>

918
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,790
those files that you selected so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

919
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to actually start all over it</font>

920
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,720
again in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the disk and I</font>

921
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,540
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

922
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,919
it will only select those files that I

923
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,020
image and you'll see it skipping big

924
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,340
chunks of data so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see</font>

925
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,200
what it's doing is its building the list

926
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,780
across the bottom you'll see it going

927
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,029
through physical files headers blah blah

928
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">blah and as it's crawling through the</font>

929
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:13,600
disk it may take it may take five

930
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,970
minutes or so for this to actually work

931
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,160
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 160 gig drive and it's</font>

932
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,140
got to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from beginning to end but</font>

933
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,960
it's only touching the sector's I told

934
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:26,410
it for the folders that I cared about so

935
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,620
it's actually imaging those sectors ya

936
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,620
been

937
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,230
you

938
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:46,339
you ever done<font color="#E5E5E5"> an md5 on a damaged hard</font>

939
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:48,140
drive you well they the piece of beta

940
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:50,538
software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you a minute ago</font>

941
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,788
their plan is to actually be able to

942
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:54,829
tell you percentages of individual files

943
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,480
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered so for instance if</font>

944
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:58,250
you have a bad sector in the middle of

945
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,079
the area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care about it will now</font>

946
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,940
know what the file is and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

947
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,799
you a report that part is not done yet

948
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,270
it's still in beta and so they're still

949
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,038
working on that piece but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually</font>

950
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,509
has a reporting mechanism to even show

951
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,630
you the physical files in the directory

952
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,980
structure that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with so as</font>

953
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,049
it's going through the process that's

954
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,819
the plan now you can still go back in

955
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:20,170
md5 those or have a report that actually

956
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:23,259
tell you the percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

957
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:25,640
it'll skip it will skip fragmentation

958
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,260
there will still<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

959
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,940
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we select another directory so</font>

960
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:35,420
it's skipping all the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

961
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:37,130
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocate yes sir um it counts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

962
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:40,190
sees the pictures and so see it has

963
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:42,200
right now 532 pics it actually has that

964
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,390
built in the problem is is that the

965
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,460
screen refresh rate is a 100

966
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:48,379
milliseconds but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's reading these at</font>

967
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 millisecond blocks so you're not</font>

968
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,579
seeing all the screen refreshes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I</font>

969
00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:54,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">can drop that down but as a programmer</font>

970
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:56,630
you're probably well aware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I do</font>

971
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,369
drop that down the machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is slower so</font>

972
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,319
I will increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speed for it to</font>

973
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:04,099
write to the screen and decrease the

974
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:05,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">speed of my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual processing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

975
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:07,880
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go or you can</font>

976
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,919
make it so high<font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't count but so if</font>

977
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,210
you wanted to to slow down screen but

978
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,619
you know it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really</font>

979
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,730
informative as you're going through it

980
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:15,559
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases you might even be able</font>

981
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell what it is that you've actually</font>

982
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,460
got or what your file system is and keep

983
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,618
in mind it's also doing this by cluster

984
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,029
it's not so it identified the cluster

985
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the operating system so you're</font>

986
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:26,240
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get some slack space and stuff</font>

987
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:29,599
with those files and things as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

988
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,118
for the most part everything here will

989
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,940
be what we care about from a file

990
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,470
perspective so and it'll skip like I

991
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,089
said it may take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes or so for it</font>

992
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,859
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this there's some point like</font>

993
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:41,119
after fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drive that</font>

994
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:42,619
there won't be any more data for me to

995
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,210
care about but anything that's

996
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:46,940
fragmented or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we selected</font>

997
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:49,100
later is going to be probably further

998
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,170
down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk but because this is also</font>

999
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,730
sequentially like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mount a hard</font>

1000
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,740
drive in your file system and you start

1001
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,140
trying to copy stuff off there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

1002
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,060
of mounting and fragmentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1003
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,730
heads basically thrashing around in this

1004
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,920
case because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the LBA blocks were</font>

1005
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,390
laid<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order it's actually doing it</font>

1006
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,950
sequentially from beginning of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

1007
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,930
to the end of the disk so it's not

1008
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,339
calling into that thrashing around or

1009
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,980
causing the head to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but move</font>

1010
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,980
sequentially down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk as it's going</font>

1011
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:22,910
it is laying the data back out exactly

1012
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,230
in the same order that it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from but</font>

1013
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,779
it's laying it out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination</font>

1014
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:29,270
disk so the destination disk is actually

1015
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,310
almost instantaneously sector by sector

1016
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,410
as this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being read is being written</font>

1017
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,700
directly to the destination disk so even

1018
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:38,029
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pulled the plug on this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

1019
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,930
it would pick up where it left off so I

1020
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:44,300
can do that but it will read the

1021
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:47,000
configuration in this entire map I mean

1022
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,340
literally I can like stop this I can you

1023
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:56,480
know quit a program unplug the equipment

1024
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:57,770
walk away and start it back up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1025
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be right where it was where it left</font>

1026
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,290
off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll actually be able to</font>

1027
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue from where you actually left</font>

1028
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:09,380
off then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will continue back from that</font>

1029
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:11,540
exact location that's correct it writes

1030
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">a profile a depth it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually has a flag</font>

1031
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,710
as this map and it's an lb a map and

1032
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,600
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a flag for every single</font>

1033
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sector then it tells what the status of</font>

1034
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,650
that flag was and that configuration is

1035
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,200
loaded into device every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it starts</font>

1036
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,250
and it does it by identifying the serial

1037
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,529
number and stuff basically of the

1038
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,360
original device so when that device is

1039
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,770
bound to this device<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as those</font>

1040
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,630
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices are the only ones that are</font>

1041
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,060
online it reads the original

1042
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:37,430
configuration file if I put a new source

1043
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,140
drive on then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told it to do that</font>

1044
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,460
it would say they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> match and it</font>

1045
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,140
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just automatically overwrite the</font>

1046
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,740
drive again which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal in a data</font>

1047
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:48,710
recovery process

1048
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:50,299
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it can do any drive but this</font>

1049
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,670
process that i'm showing you only

1050
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:58,130
supports<font color="#CCCCCC"> mmft s right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now so it only</font>

1051
00:42:52,670 --> 00:43:00,200
supports ntfs normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would tell the</font>

1052
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,000
imager to do the entire drive and it

1053
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,740
will do it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said kind of in any</font>

1054
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,560
order but including<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage or whatever</font>

1055
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,240
so right now we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of that</font>

1056
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,460
particular chunk of data now at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

1057
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll turn around and go backwards it'll</font>

1058
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,760
do three passes with different changes

1059
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,379
in between each pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do four</font>

1060
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,240
passes and make it do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1061
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,800
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it turn off power if I</font>

1062
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,720
have a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually program</font>

1063
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,240
steps in between so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have the</font>

1064
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,549
ability to choose like a what if

1065
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,250
scenario so I can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> say how fast</font>

1066
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,110
what time how many milliseconds but if I

1067
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,180
actually got a sector that actually had

1068
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,290
a particular type of error which I've

1069
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,759
covered in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other talks that have</font>

1070
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,100
actually done what types of errors I

1071
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,400
could actually tell it then to power off

1072
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive I could actually tell it then</font>

1073
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> power it off and turn the drive off</font>

1074
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,460
and turn it back on<font color="#CCCCCC"> again so I don't</font>

1075
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,660
have to be there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job and</font>

1076
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continue on from there so so and</font>

1077
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,660
you'll see like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said at the end of</font>

1078
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,610
this it'll turn around and go backwards

1079
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going to do a past backwards which</font>

1080
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,420
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change how the cash actually works</font>

1081
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,710
on the device in case there was a

1082
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,170
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with memory or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1083
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,910
device going<font color="#E5E5E5"> backwards actually kind of</font>

1084
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:10,010
in effect disables it even though we can

1085
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:11,720
disable the cash directly but it does do

1086
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:14,390
a bike comparison during what's called

1087
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,669
an ECC pass if the dr actually returns

1088
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,200
an error most equipment will actually

1089
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:19,880
just fail it will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say abort and it</font>

1090
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,439
will not return a sector but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1091
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually request the sector back with</font>

1092
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,040
certain pieces of hardware so you can

1093
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:27,140
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you can get the sector back</font>

1094
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,970
let's say 512 bytes maybe one bite was

1095
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,109
damaged you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> request that</font>

1096
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,819
back and it will do a bit wise

1097
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,020
comparison and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can tell it how many</font>

1098
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:35,120
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it to read i could say</font>

1099
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,290
read it 15 times compare them and figure

1100
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,370
out what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most probable answer is so</font>

1101
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,020
quite a complex scenario all right so

1102
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,940
anyway so it's done it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going</font>

1103
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,130
backwards i have no errors at this point

1104
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,950
for the files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about so I'm</font>

1105
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to just stop it I'm going to turn</font>

1106
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,520
the thing off

1107
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:00,430
then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take the original</font>

1108
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,460
destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk again the destination</font>

1109
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:14,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">just got wrote all the data to and I'm</font>

1110
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:15,849
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it back online and so now</font>

1111
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:18,069
comes up and you'll still<font color="#E5E5E5"> see I have a</font>

1112
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:19,900
deactivated MBR it's exactly the same

1113

state<font color="#E5E5E5"> as what it was except</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,040
i'll actually cute my image explorer

1116
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:37,290
unfortunately the project doesn't do a

1117
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:37,290
whole lot at the moment select my drive

1118
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,090
so I'm just getting the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and</font>

1119
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,870
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the green sectors like</font>

1120
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:52,240
wherever I click around on on a drive so

1121
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,240
we did this let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did this porn</font>

1122
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:01,000
LOL directory so there's a folder called

1123
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:02,589
vixens and so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually you can</font>

1124
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> map and you can see</font>

1125
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:06,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> file that I'm highlighting where all</font>

1126
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,290
these blue dots are in the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1127
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,359
green so the greens are successful it

1128
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,160
copied this file and the blue dot means

1129
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,570
they belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this file so you can</font>

1130
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,430
actually have others like I can scroll

1131
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:17,890
around anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's green I would</font>

1132
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,750
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a copy of so like if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1133
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,279
scrolling down through through the drive

1134
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,740
like all this space there's nothing

1135
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,690
there I didn't copy any of those sectors

1136
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,189
so so anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go back</font>

1137
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,750
now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say i want this folder</font>

1138
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:34,240
this is the one that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the</font>

1139
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:36,520
data now on the drive so if i save these

1140
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,189
files that will now save them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1141
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,350
folder and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can go even whilst writing</font>

1142
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:43,840
them to my destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's storing them</font>

1143
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,420
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> local machine I now actually</font>

1144
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,240
have this configuration and while it's

1145
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:56,680
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at them</font>

1146
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:58,689
so so so these actually came off of that

1147
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,220
destination disk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can go look at</font>

1148
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:06,430
them in thumbnails now the program still

1149
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:07,839
actually exporting um it could be

1150
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:09,220
anything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with drawers from</font>

1151
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,050
the standpoint of media damage head

1152
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,490
damage or certain locations of a drive

1153
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,570
that actually have physical damage to

1154
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:19,149
them um this one is not that bad it's

1155
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">not very bad but if I had a very badly</font>

1156
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:22,620
damaged drive let me keep in mind i'm

1157
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,900
trying to doing a demo here dude I

1158
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:27,430
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to work while I'm here if I</font>

1159
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,720
have a very badly damaged drive or

1160
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,029
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I have one on Friday that</font>

1161
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,279
actually rebuilt the board and rebuilt

1162
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,620
the head assembly and had to actually

1163
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,480
resolder a tip on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it had still</font>

1164
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,670
ended up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1600 errors at the end of</font>

1165
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,830
it but I was sixteen hundred is nothing

1166
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:45,130
i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know eight megs or</font>

1167
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,960
something so so not much to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with so</font>

1168
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:48,850
I've exported just those folders and

1169
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,080
again I did some other so we could

1170
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually go back remember actually</font>

1171
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:56,299
selected earlier say this guy

1172
00:47:53,630 --> 00:48:01,910
I did my documents and I did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

1173
00:47:56,299 --> 00:48:03,410
chicks folder um this one is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1174
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,240
demo drive at the moment I didn't want

1175
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:10,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show too much bad stuff so but I've</font>

1176
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,640
done many of these the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way in the</font>

1177
00:48:10,579 --> 00:48:16,930
last 30 day so but I can export the data

1178
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,930
and then go look at it

1179
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:30,540
well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second most seen hard drives</font>

1180
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,000
besides and like ntfs literally as like

1181
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,590
ninety percent of what you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> HFS is</font>

1182
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,350
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the rest of the ten</font>

1183
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:39,990
percent and occasionally linux or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nast</font>

1184
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:42,240
boxes are about all that's left this

1185
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,580
will image all of those drives but it

1186
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,709
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do this function finding the</font>

1187
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,450
individual files yet they'd only do that

1188
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:50,550
on ntfs that won't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on any of the</font>

1189
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,830
others so but that's that's typically

1190
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the majority of what I'm looking at from</font>

1191
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,290
that standpoint so so anyway that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1192
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,460
just demonstrating it coming from that

1193
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:01,170
drive and getting that process but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1194
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:03,000
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a pretty profound</font>

1195
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">process that we're actually drilling</font>

1196
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,410
down now<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the same device same tools</font>

1197
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,970
the same equipment unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

1198
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to drill down specifically to</font>

1199
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:15,750
individual files and actually get this

1200
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:17,280
done so yeah deep spar is the vendor but

1201
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,110
they also call the product<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep scar</font>

1202
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,940
disk imager so they named it like

1203
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">microsoft office you know the same thing</font>

1204
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:27,810
so so they use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same tools the same</font>

1205
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:29,580
idea to do everything now as a matter of

1206
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,020
fact this up Gary that came free like

1207
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,960
I've owned this box for like three years

1208
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,220
now this upgrade came free and they

1209
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,050
everything that they've done so far

1210
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's been upgrades with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exception</font>

1211
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:41,730
of changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware has been free so</font>

1212
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:44,759
if there's a change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware</font>

1213
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,470
which is only happened once and it

1214
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,480
wasn't necessary you didn't have to have

1215
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,339
it so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only time they've ever</font>

1216
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">charged anybody anything so all the</font>

1217
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:57,290
software that's on the box has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1218
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,290
updated for free so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1219
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,669
I don't know exactly what's inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

1220
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:05,040
other than the fact that it's probably

1221
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a flash device that also can</font>

1222
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,440
control the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical power itself is</font>

1223
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,490
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to the power switch and</font>

1224
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,080
stuff as well I mean it's basically

1225
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,879
doing all<font color="#E5E5E5"> its commands through the ATA</font>

1226
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,870
command set and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then some enhanced</font>

1227
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,880
knowledge that they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have with</font>

1228
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,350
regards to individual vendors because

1229
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,590
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that this tool</font>

1230
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,240
can do which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only tool in its</font>

1231
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:29,850
price range that actually does this but

1232
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:31,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">we it doesn't matter it can do all of</font>

1233
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,640
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> including zip drives and everything</font>

1234
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,950
else the only problem right now is

1235
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,480
actually solid state because<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid state</font>

1236
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:40,410
drives don't conform<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the standard 80</font>

1237
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:45,090
a subset yeah they're just digits

1238
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:46,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bridgeport's for all of them yeah you</font>

1239
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:51,600
need a PI license to do this especially

1240
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:55,490
if it's on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> forensics job right inside</font>

1241
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,490
joke or outside joke everyone good yeah

1242
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,230
well I I wish I could say that that was

1243
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">true but no you do have bad sectors it's</font>

1244
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,160
usually they just get completely

1245
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">obliterated and you don't get control of</font>

1246
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:14,250
them at all so that's the biggest

1247
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:19,230
problem it is worse yeah it's worse on a

1248
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:21,420
data recovery into yes we have a problem

1249
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:23,430
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now if the MBR is messed up it</font>

1250
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,230
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently look for partition</font>

1251
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,759
structures that the MBR doesn't know so

1252
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:28,770
you could hand build one if you wanted

1253
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,480
to they are writing a partition search

1254
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:33,300
feature keep in mind is all beta right

1255
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,070
now so they're writing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mba partition</font>

1256
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:38,790
search feature for those same partitions

1257
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:41,070
so that is a that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently a problem</font>

1258
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:43,050
though it will try to do an ECC recovery

1259
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:44,520
on the MBR though so for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

1260
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:47,970
if there's one bite<font color="#CCCCCC"> to still an error it</font>

1261
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,070
will try to recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from it so but this</font>

1262
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,259
tool does some other things and this is

1263
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:56,100
not a part of the demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've prepared so</font>

1264
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:58,410
if it blows up if if I actually wanted

1265
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do something with heads there's</font>

1266
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,950
actually a function<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually looks</font>

1267
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:06,900
at heads and you can turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and off bad</font>

1268
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:08,220
heads and so you can individually it'll

1269
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,960
individually search through the zone

1270
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,649
tables and it will build the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone table</font>

1271
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,600
listing so anybody who knows what

1272
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:16,060
we'll know what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about Bonnie</font>

1273
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,620
plus plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's building is using zone</font>

1274
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,080
tables and it's using his own tables to

1275
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:21,490
identify all the heads and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> depending</font>

1276
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,340
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how long sometimes just take an hour</font>

1277
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,839
to actually run but it'll build a list

1278
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,550
of all of the heads and you can

1279
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,320
individually turn off a head so those

1280
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,750
drives that have a clunking error but

1281
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,830
they still come ready if anybody knows

1282
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,150
I'm talking about like three<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font>

1283
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,250
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to drive and it's going</font>

1284
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,780
clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk and then

1285
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,340
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes ready and it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1286
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,990
copy files but then it starts airing out

1287
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,510
and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes that's a bad head</font>

1288
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:46,149
and you can actually turn off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad</font>

1289
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:47,680
head image all the good stuff and then

1290
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,630
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try to deal with the bad</font>

1291
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,950
head or make a new head or do something

1292
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,140
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that standpoint replaced</font>

1293
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,549
the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so in a minute what will</font>

1294
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,710
happen was when it's done with the zone

1295
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,090
table it'll give me an option to turn

1296
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,120
off individual head so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1297
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:08,220
one's only got three heads or four heads

1298
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:10,509
I've always seen I see for go by so yeah

1299
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,859
you don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other head so</font>

1300
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,480
you can turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off at it'll actually</font>

1301
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,760
fill in the holes that'll fill in the

1302
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,410
gaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's done if I actually</font>

1303
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,930
went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and I actually looked</font>

1304
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,549
at the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually now have four</font>

1305
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,500
heads I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go down and turn</font>

1306
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,060
off an individual head this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

1307
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:30,130
tool in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this price range which actually</font>

1308
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:31,660
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it'll read</font>

1309
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:33,730
whatever that head is assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

1310
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,529
will skip all of that data but that does

1311
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,480
not mean that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have like like</font>

1312
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:39,430
zones are actually divided up according

1313
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to numbers of LBA blocks that are</font>

1314
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:43,270
consecutive so zones with may still be

1315
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,950
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg's you may still have a good word</font>

1316
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:52,000
document even though one head might be

1317
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:55,230
missing so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not meant to do secure</font>

1318
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,230
a snow but you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> claw p</font>

1319
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,230
yeah

1320
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:05,260
yeah it'll wipe a drive it'll do a wipe

1321
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,210
drive but it's not doing secure race so

1322
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,920
it's not doing anything with with bad

1323
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,650
bad sectors fat<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks from that</font>

1324
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,920
standpoint for wiping them but any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1325
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,030
questions so anyway I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1326
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cool i think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1327
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:19,720
direction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's going with</font>

1328
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,040
data recovery tools and so we're now

1329
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,660
actually kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting this merger</font>

1330
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,310
that we didn't have before we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1331
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,330
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the drive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you'd</font>

1332
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,740
have to go and do something like run our

1333
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:28,420
studios or some other data recovery

1334
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,069
software to read what you've recovered

1335
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,349
and you wouldn't know what your bad

1336
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:34,720
blocks were which files like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had 25</font>

1337
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:36,580
bad sectors I'd have no idea what I had

1338
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,020
but here I'll get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good percentage and</font>

1339
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,520
I'll get a list and i'll know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1340
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:44,050
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at specifically if it's good or</font>

1341
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:46,170
bad so but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had so thank</font>

1342
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:46,170
you
