1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to my destination</font>

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk then I'm going to deactivate the</font>

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,879
MBR this is basically so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,429
doesn't blow up so I deactivate it it

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:18,000
turns it off and now i'm going to just

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:19,770
turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine so now what I want</font>

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,140
to do is now I have this catalog I'm

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take my actual destination disk</font>

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,369
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take my destination</font>

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:37,230
disk off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine and i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">plug it into windows let's see if this</font>

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">switches screens correctly</font>

13
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so now I've got it plugged into</font>

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,949
Windows and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows wouldn't be able to</font>

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">see anything basically all I would see</font>

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:08,000
at this point well if it comes up

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:23,320
the dr initializes and shows up yeah

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so basically our how an</font>

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,820
uninitialized is no MBR and it just has

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,049
just the all unallocated space but the

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,298
piece of software that goes with this

22
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">device knows that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a table and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,509
knows where this table is so what I

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,090
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do now this will look</font>

25
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:38,140
a little beta and so you visual basic

26
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,619
people will kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'm</font>

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,619
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font>

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,309
um

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,399
yeah it's USB external hard drive

30
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,519
for that for the imager the imager talks

31
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,860
through all the ATA commands and

32
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,850
actually does all the work at the at the

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,950
actual imager level itself the this now

34
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,720
i'm actually just using<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows all it's</font>

35
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,339
going to do is read this table and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,989
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be looking at this table so</font>

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,110
this thing starts up is called image

38
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,850
explorer now here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its really beta so</font>

39
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,350
here's the story<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:36,359
create a no I did not build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is</font>

41
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,700
actually part of deep spar stuff so I

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,920
have this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Explorer and</font>

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,869
basically it sees the two hard drives in

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list when I hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two hard drives</font>

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,200
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and it will see that</font>

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,459
there's a partition and now I can

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,530
actually do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's called</font>

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,660
scanned file system all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does is</font>

49

looks at all my mft records over here on

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,190
the right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's building me a table</font>

51
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then once it's done i'll actually be</font>

52
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,609
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down through the table and</font>

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,989
now you'll actually see all the

54
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,870

91
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk which probably won't do</font>

92
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:43,750
anything because there's no OS on it so

93

I'm turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then i take this</font>

94
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,950

95
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:55,000
it back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and I will turn</font>

96
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,080
this thing now i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch back</font>

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,490
to that machine so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see what i'm</font>

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:06,450
doing next what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no i never did</font>

101
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:19,669
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to run my application</font>

102
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:24,240
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the hardware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah</font>

103
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:25,710
then this I'm hitting f11 to turn the

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,630
power on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this device will now turn the</font>

105
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">power on and keep in mind that there's</font>

106
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,449
like all these functions that have

107
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,250
existed on this thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> like three</font>

108
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,470
years before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got this far that does</font>

109
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,389
whole bunches of other things images in

110
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reverse skip stuff does all kinds of</font>

111
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,990
damaged areas I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to focus on</font>

112
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,638
what these files are and if there's

113
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,320
damage in other places on the drive that

114
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,750
because ftk wouldn't make it through

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,130
this job it would die in all the all the

116
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,050
unallocated space and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

117
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:56,520
stuff I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> normally have to copy so</font>

118
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:58,050
so now i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> my device selected and so</font>

119
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,210
now i<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have the same status</font>

120
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything that was on my device before</font>

121
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,138
is still there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can basically do an</font>

122
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,520
imaging job you know like you can't do

123
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,889
this with ftk you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like stop</font>

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,169
and come back later so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can actually</font>

125
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,449
stop an image in process put it on the

126
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">shelf do another job put the two back on</font>

127
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the configuration that comes from the</font>

128
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,940
destination drive will maintain all the

129
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,530
status information for everything

130
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,360
anything that's already been copied it

131
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,559
will never do again<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that needs</font>

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,750
to be copied it will still have a table

133
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,000
too but<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now it just has a table</font>

134
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,150
that basically says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to image all</font>

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,770
those files that you selected so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

136
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to actually start all over it</font>

137
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,669
again in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the disk and I</font>

138
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:38,520
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

139
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,900
it will only select those files that I

140
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,000
image and you'll see it's skipping big

141
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,320
chunks of data so you'll actually see

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,180
what it's doing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its building the list</font>

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,760
across the bottom you'll see it going

144
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,010
through physical files headers blah blah

145
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,930
blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its crawling through the</font>

146
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,580
disk it may take it may take five

147
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,950
minutes or so for this to actually work

148
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,109
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 160 gig drive and it's</font>

149
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,120
got to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning to end but</font>

150
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,910
it's only touching the sector's I told

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,389
it for the folders that I cared about so

152
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,599
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually imaging those sectors ya</font>

153
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,599
been

154
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:26,320
you ever done an md5 on a damaged hard

155
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:28,120
drive you well they the piece of beta

156
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,490
software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you a minute ago</font>

157
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,770
their plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to actually be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

158
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you percentages of individual files</font>

159
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,460
that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> recovered so for instance if</font>

160
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,230
you have a bad sector in the middle of

161
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,060
the area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you care about it will now</font>

162
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,920
know what the file is and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

163
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,780
you a report that part is not done yet

164
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,250
it's still in beta and so they're still

165
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,020
working on that piece but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually</font>

166
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,490
has a reporting mechanism to even show

167
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,609
you the physical files in the directory

168
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,960
structure that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with so as</font>

169
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,060
it's going through the process that's

170
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,440
the plan now you can still go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

171
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,320
empty five those or have a report that

172
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,020
actually tell you the percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

173
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,690
but it'll skip it will skip

174
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,520
fragmentation there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> still be some</font>

175
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,530
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we select another</font>

176
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:14,650
directory so it's skipping all the stuff

177
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we did not allocate yes sir um it</font>

178
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,450
counts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sees the pictures and so</font>

179
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,250
see it has right now 532 pics it

180
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,409
actually has that built in the problem

181
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,140
is is that the screen refresh rate is a

182
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,390
100 milliseconds but it's reading these

183
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:30,280
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 millisecond blocks so you're not</font>

184
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,559
seeing all the screen refreshes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I</font>

185
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,059
can drop that down but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a programmer</font>

186
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,609
you're probably well aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I do</font>

187
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:38,348
drop that down the machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is slower so</font>

188
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,450
I will increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speed for it to</font>

189
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,870
write to the screen and decrease<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

190
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,430
speed of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual processing you can</font>

191
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just say what you're you can</font>

192
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,900
make it so high it won't count but so if

193
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,190
you wanted to to slow down screen but

194
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,600
you know it is kind of really

195
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,740
informative as you're going through it

196
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,540
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cases you might even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

197
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,910
to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is that you've actually</font>

198
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,439
got or what your file system is and keep

199
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,600
in mind it's also doing this by cluster

200
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,010
it's not so it identified the cluster

201
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the operating system so you're</font>

202
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,220
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get some slack space and stuff</font>

203
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:09,579
with those files and things as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

204
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,100
for the most part everything here will

205
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,920
be what we care about from a file

206
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,450
perspective so and it'll skip like I

207
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,069
said it may take<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes or so for it</font>

208
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this there's some point like</font>

209
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,070
after fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the drive that</font>

210
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,570
there won't be any more data for me to

211
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,190
care about but anything that's

212
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,950
fragmented or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we selected</font>

213
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,020
later is going to be probably further

214
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,150
down the disk but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also</font>

215
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,710
sequentially like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mount a hard</font>

216
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:34,720
drive in your file system and you start

217
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,120
trying to copy stuff off there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

218
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
of mounting and fragmentation and the

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,710
heads basically thrashing around in this

220
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,900
case because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the LBA blocks were</font>

221
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,370
laid out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order it's actually doing it</font>

222
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,900
sequentially from beginning of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk</font>

223
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,910
to the end of the disk so it's not

224
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,319
calling into that thrashing around or

225
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,010
causing the head to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> but move</font>

226
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,010
