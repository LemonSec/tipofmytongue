00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:45,068
to heroin needles and that's kind of a

144
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:48,729
treat so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an Easter egg</font>

145
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:51,099
hunt but our space continues to grow and

146
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,830
thrive and we're still even<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

147
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:59,169
open from as a year now we're continuing

148
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:03,580
to build it out anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chiefs all</font>

149
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:09,190
right don't you guys love my powerpoint

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:11,109
skills my they I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most artistic</font>

151
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:15,430
person in the world so this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of raw</font>

152
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:17,710
so how we came to be basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in</font>

153
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:23,259
Atlanta three of the founding members

eater<font color="#CCCCCC"> raeford and James shin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> han moved</font>

155
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,500
up here from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Columbus Georgia and they</font>

156
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,049
said they ran a different kind of

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,458
collaboration space down there it was

158
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:39,098
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some sort of free internet</font>

159
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:42,098
conglomerate a conglomerate in some sort

160
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,089
of library basement it up yes I can't

161
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,870
say that were

162
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:49,430
I think it went<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty bad and then when</font>

163
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">they came to atlanta they said let's</font>

164
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">start a hackerspace so what they found</font>

165
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:57,319
out when they put their feelers out is

166
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,859
there were a lot of other groups talking

167
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:03,139
about starting hackerspace DC four of

168
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,629
four was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting a</font>

169
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,129
hackerspace the<font color="#CCCCCC"> atlantic's linux</font>

170
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:10,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">enthusiasts groups we're talking about</font>

171
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:12,199
finding a space a bunch of groups and

172
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:14,689
what happened is they put the feeler out

173
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:17,748
there and then next thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

174
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,879
were having immediately these meetings

175
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:23,290
at manuel's taverns of over a hundred

176
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:26,059
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start up this hacker space</font>

177
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,099
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the probably I think one</font>

178
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:31,189
of our greatest accomplishments is a

179
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,889
hacker space is we start it up with over

180
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:36,649
100 people interested and had an actual

181
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:39,350
waiting list to become a member we

182
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:41,569
capped the members at we capped the

183
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:48,379
membership around 50 to start off with

184
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:49,998
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> had quite a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long waiting list so a</font>

185
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,459
lot of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> members come from a lot of</font>

186
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:56,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">different groups and that went pretty</font>

187
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:59,719
well together the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

188
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:02,269
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our agenda of course was to find a</font>

189
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">space I don't know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you guys</font>

190
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:08,120
are involved in your local hackerspace

191
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:10,489
who if you're outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Atlanta but</font>

192
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,179
finding the space had to be the one of

193
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:16,790
the most difficult feats yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

194
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:20,540
meeting in March and we didn't find a

195
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,809
suitable space until June yeah 2008 yeah

196
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,920
2,800<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't on no I'm sorry we</font>

197
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:29,540
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting at manuel's tavern</font>

198
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:32,899
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> October of 2008 and then we found</font>

199
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,559
the note and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we found finally found</font>

200
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:40,550
our space of March last year 2009 and

201
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:43,309
moved in and gin<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay trust me i was</font>

202
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,429
there i was i was there too and I

203
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:49,540
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was made dan dan wasn't you</font>

204
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,540
were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you weren't there</font>

205
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,779
okay there was a lot of drinking and

206
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,180
shenanigans during this whole time<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

207
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,800
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably one of our</font>

208
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,739
most difficult feat because now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

209
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,979
50 potential members of 50 people

210
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,320
looking for 50 different spaces and at

211
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,649
50 different locations on 50 different

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,779
sides of town so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was probably our</font>

213
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:15,600
first big challenge as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hackerspace</font>

214
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know you had 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people up</font>

215
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,140
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here 20 people like</font>

216
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,160
that's not even in Atlanta should be

217
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:26,069
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here oh no that's a crime zone etc</font>

218
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,600
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally we finally decided on the</font>

219
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,690
metropolitan area because of the raw

220
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:35,399
square footage and for the price and it

221
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:44,279
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap it was cheap so it was very</font>

222
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:49,040
affordable oh we rent it I'll field

223
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,040
questions at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our talk mr.</font>

toys and making them make weird sounds

329
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,569

330
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:58,009
speak and spell and make it sound like

331
00:16:50,569 --> 00:17:01,729

342
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,169
make puppets we're partnering with an

343
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,789
art collective in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta and kind of</font>

344
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">posting allowing them to use our space</font>

345
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:36,830
and in turn they're going to be starting

346
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to teach classes for us and one of them</font>

347
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,230
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be how to make puppets so</font>

other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing at the</font>

350
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,889
hackerspace our projects so all this

351
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,480
before we go on to the pictures of the

352
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:58,820
hackerspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk about some of the</font>

353
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:02,350
projects we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very our members</font>

354
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:06,610
consist of a very very unique group of

355
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:08,969
all walks of life we have biologists

356
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,590
people who

357
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:17,960
hack the mind we have network security

358
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:22,320
people we have welding people we have

359
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,440
architect architects who else people

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:32,520
that so students students<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all things</font>

361
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">alcohol works yes alcoholics and then we</font>

362
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,809
have managers that don't know anything

363
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:42,979
that's me so some of the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

364
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:46,350
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> projects right now soil</font>

365
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,350
electric conductivity LEDs play that's

366
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,959
why one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our biologists she's</font>

367
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:57,299
basically making a<font color="#E5E5E5"> project that will</font>

368
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,799
measure the conductivity of soil now

369
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,440
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of biology in this that I</font>

370
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,350
don't understand so I apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

371
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,659
butcher your product your project up

372
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:14,399
here basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has something to do</font>

373
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:15,990
with the stuff in the soil I think she's

374
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,030
gone for like moisture content yeah

375
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,419
moisture content well depending on the

376
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:24,030
plants giving off nitrogen wrap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

377
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:28,260
changes the conductivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the soil so</font>

378
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,428
yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bummer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right but now</font>

379
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,169
she's gonna measure it with LEDs and

380
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,720
tried to do some artwork to get Oh make

381
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:39,270
actual displays using plants we have an

382
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,730
LED grow box uh yeah it's it's a it's a

383
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,658
box where where one of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> members is</font>

384
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,909
growing plants via LEDs what kind of

385
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:50,870
plans I think there's some some grass

386
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:53,669
and cacti what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have in there Tao</font>

387
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,209
yeah our<font color="#E5E5E5"> members actually sitting out</font>

388
00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:00,530
here we have grass herbs cacti you know

389
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">things eat girl in a grow box</font>

390
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:08,510
yeah UAV drone one of the members is

391
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,510
actually just trying to still research

392
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:15,170
and is now just purchasing parts for his

393
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:18,200
UAV drone which will fly all over

394
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:23,630
Atlanta and spy on people can we put

395
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:26,690
missiles on it ducky yeah we can this is

396
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:29,860
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> recorded we have a foundry of</font>

397
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,120
project a lot of the metal workers there

398
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,479
they've been making their own homemade

399
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,790
foundry out of buckets and cement we've

400
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,560
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of aluminum pouring</font>

401
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:42,830
one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pre said we</font>

402
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,540
recycle a lot so we take lots of stuff

403
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,330
old hard drives<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken hard drives</font>

404
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,280
instead of giving them the scat we take

405
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,399
them apart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the aluminum casing</font>

406
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,820
and melt those down and make aluminum

407
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,580
cupcake now that biscuits so that's a

408
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">really a cool project and I'll let Dan</font>

409
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,300
talk about one of the next project

410
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's happening at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the space um the</font>

411
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:07,040
artificial presence is something I'm

412
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,080
working on with with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> tau we're</font>

413
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,240
looking at giving the space a

414
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,610
personality<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also something you can</font>

415
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,470
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that can also automate</font>

416
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,540
several activities like turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

417
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,220
lights and and turning off lights if no

418
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,899
one's there because we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leave</font>

419
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,400
lights on every now and then and also

420
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring the temperature in the</font>

421
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,570
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making sure we're not we're</font>

422
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,389
being efficient with our power usage and

423
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot it's still kind of a work in</font>

424
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,100
progress we're trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

425
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,620
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with it and the next one</font>

572
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,520
want but welding classes are usually

573
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:17,490
once area once every three weeks we're

574

586
00:29:53,510 --> 00:30:01,610
high member to finger ratio so watch

587
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,260
yourself yeah today I believe were zero

588
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:10,850
accidents is that correct we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

592
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:22,160
yet yeah it it's very important when

593
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:27,770
you're starting hacking space to get

594
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:31,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">legal counsel and waivers um this is up</font>

595
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:34,879
yeah this is uh from the mystery box

596
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:37,690
today we we love we have a member that

597
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,030
collects money from other members and

598
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:43,250
orders these big huge electronic mystery

599
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:45,770
boxes and then we from electronic<font color="#E5E5E5"> gold</font>

603
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:58,130
in it and sorting it so we probably have

604
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,730
like a few thousand capacitors laying

605
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:06,350
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other stuff so in their mind</font>

609
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,230
box on the table and he's probably

that sponsor will be hazed and beaten

675
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:45,089
accordingly for sponsoring somebody who

676
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,668
shouldn't be sponsored once you get a

677

say we might knock the wall down and

701
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,520
start invading our neighbors space if it

702
