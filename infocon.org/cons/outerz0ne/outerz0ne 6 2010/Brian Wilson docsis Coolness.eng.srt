we're good now<font color="#CCCCCC"> dragging the car</font>

2
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:30,939
you know those secrets that they say the

3
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:33,269
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine can read everything all</font>

4
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we ready</font>

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,919
so Brian's going to give a talk about

6
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">docsis now so so please welcome Brian</font>

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:01:01,930
and and here you go how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going guys</font>

8
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so my name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Wilson I</font>

9
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:08,260
handled his slim jim 100 actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this company but here on my own</font>

11
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,700
recognizance so the group<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm with is</font>

12
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,560
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgia computer users group</font>

13
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,020
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in the process of opening</font>

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:27,330
a hacker space here shortly and making

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:30,340
is a not getting high I can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> me okay</font>

16
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,110
so I'm part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer middle Georgia</font>

17
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,940
computer users group we're out of a

18
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,740
middle Georgia probably best thing to

19
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,960
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's making area about 80 miles</font>

20
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">south of here here shortly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font>

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,649
to be working right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now on opening up a</font>

22
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:50,770
hacker space so the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> address for that</font>

23
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:52,600
is techno dorg thank you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i said</font>

24
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,420
uh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got that land party we're going to</font>

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,490
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosting april second and third in</font>

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,720
macon so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website and go</font>

27
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,080
there and check it out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,330
on that so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to just go over</font>

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the basics of what docsis</font>

30
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,440
protocol is and how it interacts with

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,680
the seams yes so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you here</font>

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,170
have a cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> modem at home just about</font>

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,880
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a few of you</font>

34
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,500
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dsl and maybe some of you</font>

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,890
have fiber to the home hopefully

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,990
nobody's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial-up so doctors the</font>

37
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,250
protocol your cable modem uses to

38
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,410
communicate over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the radio frequency</font>

39
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's get back to the cable companies</font>

40
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:32,109
head in for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the ISP</font>

41
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,989
services for you it's very need a

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it so we're looking</font>

43
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">at now is we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the cable</font>

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,910
broadband architecture and we're going

45
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at in a few different ways and</font>

46
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,310
there's gonna be some you know simpler

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,440
ways then we get little more advanced

48
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,400
looking at it but as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,170
slides there you've got the Internet

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,799
cloud over here then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

51
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,298
service provider IP core network within

52
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,680
that network that connects them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

53
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,569
sea mts came

54
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,670
transmission system which is a big

55
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:02,890
router and then from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there it actually</font>

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:07,078
goes out over the optical plant

57
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,309
eventually to call actual RF plant and

58
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,540
if we're really lucky we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it to a</font>

59
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,489
drop and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it into your</font>

60
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,159
house from there it'll plug into your

61
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,379
modem set-top box emta whatever services

62
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,328
you subscribe to we're focusing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">cable modem here today and we're going</font>

64
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go over to how docsis works and how</font>

65
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,599
to interaction the CMT s and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

66
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:32,139
to the very basics has anybody heard of

67
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:40,089
docsis before now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has a</font>

68
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:41,349
question any point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time just know he</font>

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,629
asked if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about cable</font>

70
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,849
modem and capping uncapping hacking or

71
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,899
anything else like that no I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

72
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:52,869
about that because that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:56,109
that to service so it's illegal probably

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,819
not i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you i could probably tell</font>

75
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:00,129
you that anything you do in a docsis

76
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,638
network because it's an RF signature can

77
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:06,909
be tracked so as anonymous as you think

78
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,760
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be with the RF spectrum and</font>

79
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,129
information timing offset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

80
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,540
decibel level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

81
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably track you down within 50 feet</font>

82
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,529
on the cable plant of where you're at so

83
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,019
even if you were to clone somebody

84
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:22,330
else's information and show up somewhere

85
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,729
else in town and master it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> them doing</font>

86
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,490
bad things we can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out exactly</font>

87
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:29,469
where you're at and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's instantaneous</font>

88
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,810
we just have to do some basic formulas

89
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,759
to figure out timing offset from<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

90
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">optic to co actual and then where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

91
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,860
tap losses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can usually get with it</font>

92
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:47,610
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 feet of where you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at and if</font>

93
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:47,610
that's in a building yeah yes I do yes

94
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:55,009
ok so for Cisco Systems I'm a network

95
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,969
consulting engineer title<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

96
00:04:55,009 --> 00:05:01,310
says it all I support major cable ISPs

97
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:02,509
my side is a consultant is I could

98
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:05,330
actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily have</font>

99
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,210
to recommend cisco gear when the when

100
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,128
the customer engages my team we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

101
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,169
advocates of the customer so we are

102
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:14,419
their consultant though we you know we

103
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,710
do work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor our job is to make</font>

104
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,000
sure their life is easier and they have

105
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,460
the right solutions in their network not

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,050
necessarily buying this or that but is

107
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,609
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you need and how is it BES</font>

108
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:28,849
implemented to your network to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you</font>

109
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:31,280
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> docsis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">CableLabs was created by the cable</font>

116
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,599
companies they didn't want proprietary

expensive gear that they couldn't get

118
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:49,639
out of so they pulled together the big

119
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,370
guys and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically formed CableLabs</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofit organization then the</font>

look at the chipset the information all

the actual hardware that's in there if

<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in docsis and you want to</font>

142
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">know all the information about it</font>

143
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:43,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit-level the information is available</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so docsis defines the</font>

145
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,580
interface requirements for cable modems

146
00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:48,310
involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data distribution</font>

147
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">over cable television system networks</font>

148
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,690
basically it makes your cable modem work

149
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,529
so second ago we looked at a cable TV

150
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,209
plant well now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take them</font>

151
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the look at it and this time we're</font>

152
00:06:56,209 --> 00:07:02,560
looking at in a little bigger view

153
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:04,960
so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my mouth shows up</font>

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so here you would see like the</font>

155
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended would represent off air video</font>

157
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,240
sometimes your your cable company may

158
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,860
not have a direct fiber feed to get the

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,470
video stream in so they may actually put

160
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,700
up a set of bunny ears on a little tower

161
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,960
out there and actually pull the signal

162
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,150
in that way to inject it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,310

<font color="#CCCCCC">pulling out services off of large-scale</font>

165
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,080

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,700
services your HBO ESPN CN you know all

167
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,560
this all the services they offer you

168
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,640
they're not locally made there from all

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there other you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">other broadcasters and they're going to</font>

171
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,990
collect those off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> satellite once</font>

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,210
they get those they're going to bring

173
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,130
them in through fiber and eventually go

174
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,479
into what's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a head in the local</font>

175
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,610
headed is where all the equipment is

176
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,830
that's where the channel lineups at

177
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,330
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're combining</font>

178
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,539
that's where your transmitters your

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,190
optical transmitters are because for the

00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,830
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> send all the information down</font>

183
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,210

neighborhood into<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's called a node</font>

185
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,270
the node if transfers the optical signal

186
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,280
back into an RF technology and that's

187
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually between 5 and 11 megahertz and</font>

then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to downstream and</font>

actual these are going to be separate

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,919
the optical fiber paps you eventually

199
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,750
get to the dark blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> line here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes in the rg59 cable you</font>

know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your walls down yet</font>

209
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">again another demonstration of the same</font>

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,920
basic diagram and a different format and

211
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,630
what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pretty much</font>

212
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,500
represent here is you see the head and

213
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,780
you also have what's called

214
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,690
sites so that's going to be another site

215
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,560
similar to the head in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe closer</font>

216
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,210
geographically to where the customers

217
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to be serviced and then the</font>

218
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:23,050
signals may actually leave their

219
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,819
optically<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they going before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

220
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,790
to coax and then these little things

221
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,080
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> no these are actually fibers strand</font>

222
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the size of a shoebox their pole</font>

223
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,850
mounted or their pedestals on the ground

224
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,740
and you know that's that's we get that

225
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,540
and then awesome the outside cable plant

226
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,190
you're going to have power supplies

227
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,870
every so often<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's going to be a big</font>

228
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,150
box of hanging up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone pole</font>

229
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,590
or in a pedestal<font color="#CCCCCC"> aground when they myth</font>

230
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,510
inside those there's car batteries and

231
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,890
that's they get local power from the

232
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,340
power company but they have a battery

233
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">backup in the event local powers lost so</font>

234
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,260
even when the power goes out nine times

235
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of ten your cable TV is not down you</font>

236
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,700
just can't turn your TV on so if you

237
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,410
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTA voice services to your cable</font>

238
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,300
provider so if you have a voice enabled

239
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,579
cable modem a lot of those will have a

240
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">battery backup in it reason being is</font>

241
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,390
just because the power went out it

242
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,210
doesn't mean the cable TV networks down

243
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,430
you can still make phone calls most

244
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">models of the emta devices will shut off</font>

245
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ethernet port so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of backup</font>

246
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,380
you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop running and the</font>

247
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,270
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do that is the battery can</font>

248
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,070
only sustain the devices for so long and

249
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,630
keeping the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> port and the rj11</font>

250
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">ports all at the same time with drain</font>

251
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,780
batteries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily the idea</font>

252
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,189
behind the battery backup is to keep the

253
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,199
phone service up nigga you have an

254
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:37,830
emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that your alarm system</font>

255
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,830
still needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call out good</font>

256
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:01,770
it could be or could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple fact</font>

257
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:03,750
that there could be signal loss or an

258
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:06,949
active component failure so when you

259
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:11,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the power loss it actually could be</font>

260
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:14,070
you know catastrophic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah an</font>

261
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,850
amplifier goes down you<font color="#CCCCCC"> x edit n you're</font>

262
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,400
going to lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> it cuz you're going to</font>

263
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:21,570
take a large DB attenuation<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the</font>

264
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,610
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing to point out here real</font>

265
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,890
quick would be there's a slow error here

266
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,300
this is downstream this is the frequency

267
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">base you're actually going to receive</font>

268
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,469
from the cable company directly to your

269
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,740
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> 88 to 880 megahertz or actually</font>

270
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could even go up to 1 gigahertz so</font>

271
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,870
that is also referred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the RF</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">provider to you well that'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of</font>

275
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,850
useless to have one way communications I

276
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,100
mean if all you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever do is listen</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can never respond well then you</font>

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,050
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have communications it's</font>

279
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,819
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a radio talk show so to</font>

280
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,579
provide services<font color="#CCCCCC"> like pay-per-view video</font>

281
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,430
on demand data voice stuff like that you

282
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,530

00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,870
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> line and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what it was</font>

286
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,550
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you received your download over the</font>

287
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,600
cable modem and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> your upstream</font>

288
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:18,270
traffic back was actually over an analog

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,830
modem which is called telco return weird

290
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:22,620
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> dialed a modem you know modem</font>

291
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,600
back to get the upstream back typically

292
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,700
people people like why isn't symmetrical

293
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,990
eyes the service not symmetrical well

294
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,610
I've just point out the downstream

295
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,580
there's another little<font color="#E5E5E5"> area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here you see</font>

296
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,620
where says upstream that's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to</font>

297
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,780
forty two megahertz you see there's a

298
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,959
big difference in the frequency base

299
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:42,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the downstream and upstream with</font>

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:44,160
that being is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upstream is extremely</font>

301
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,930

309
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">can call your cable company and change</font>

314
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,550
something so with the two-way

315
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,900
communications it's not just convenient

316
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,189
for the cable or the cable company

317
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:19,050
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's also community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

324
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,630
again kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I explained it back in</font>

325
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,280
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old days and when cable TV was</font>

326
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,960
considered community antenna it was one

327
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,939
unit you know unidirectional one way to

328
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,950
data path they provided you pictures

329
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,580
they sent the information to you you

330
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">never talk back more recent networks now</font>

331
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,060
is the hfc design where it's actually

332
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">five are up too close to the</font>

333
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,589
neighborhood and at that point you have

334
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,089
two optical paths one forward and one

335
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:04,320
return where you can actually transmit

336
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:05,760
data back and your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford is considered</font>

337
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,770
your downstream and your return is

338
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:14,189
considered your upstream so you're

339
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,250
combining so what you have here is in

340
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,090
North America we use what's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> mxb</font>

341
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay there's actually two annexes</font>

342
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,700
there's an annex a and annex B for your

343
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:25,439
frequency allocation so with amex be in

344
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,840
North America it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually six</font>

345
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,780
megahertz block is considered a channel

346
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,310
in Europe and and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries it's</font>

347
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,530
eight megahertz so it's a slightly

348
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">larger and it's the same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with with</font>

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit better so good for them but most of</font>

352
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,250
equipment out there is going to be

353
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,010
suited for<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis there is two flavors</font>

difference between doctors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> j docsis</font>

358
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,550
is they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you the ability to</font>

359
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a slightly larger upstream</font>

360
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,709
frequency base so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America we</font>

361
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,960
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to forty two megahertz and</font>

362

363
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,330
five and then Europe at salsa five to

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty five but the J docsis doesn't use</font>

megahertz on their downstream channels

367
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,370
so if you have if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

368
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,480
frequency base that you know 88 to 880

369
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,940
if you're actually inserting media or

370
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,680
MPEG frames in there and you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,360
it in six megahertz blocks you got to

what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well the door is locked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

424
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,380
you know this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device is not light</font>

425
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,889
you can ask DJ because<font color="#E5E5E5"> his backs better</font>

426
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,790
than mine I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see anybody</font>

427
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,700
really trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the building</font>

429
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:08,790
trackable so no we're getting ready to

430
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it</font>

431
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,850
real time like I said we've actually set

432
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">up a six foot plant up in the room I was</font>

433
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,010
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down here than</font>

434
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,178
I talked to Scott and Scott said I'm

435
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,650
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on the table</font>

436
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,610
it's going to take me probably 20

437
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,840
minutes to get it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and I was like</font>

438
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,330
well yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't to carry</font>

439
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,220
that router down so we got the router

440
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,240
actually set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up set up live ready to go</font>

441
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">up in the room I think we have like</font>

442
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,780
seven or eight modems on it we could

443
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,320
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> add more I only had I only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> profit</font>

444
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">16 way splitter so I only can actually a</font>

445
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:41,610
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much so many devices plug to it</font>

446
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:43,350
so this device here if it's the 7246 vxr

447
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,178
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to say anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

448

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really care I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of</font>

449
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,960
you could afford it or have a need to

450
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,300
buy this equipment so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just putting</font>

451
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,010
the technology this device here is not

452
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:57,090
end of life it has been around for like

453
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,800
12 years but just<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently they've come</font>

454
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,750
out with a newer line card for this one

455
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a newer processor so it will be able</font>

456
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do docsis three auto so some of you</font>

457
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,100
probably heard the terminology docsis 30

458
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,710
you're like wow that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be great</font>

459
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,080
well each version of docs this has to be

460
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,320
backwards compatible through<font color="#CCCCCC"> CableLabs</font>

461
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,710
so docsis 10 there is no quality of

462
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">service best ever date of law docsis 11</font>

463
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,550
actually added costs and the ability it

464
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,420
is to kill out different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

465
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,740
service flows into dynamic service flows

466
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,020
docsis 20 the only thing that did was

467
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,210
actually increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the modulation in</font>

468
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,020
types of statistical multiplexing you

469
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,510
can do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

470
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,950
On<font color="#E5E5E5"> the return plant or the upstream to</font>

471
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,210
allow higher data throughput on the

472
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,830
upstream it didn't change how fast you

473
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,070
could download that was the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

474
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">docsis 11 and then docsis 30 we've in</font>

475
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,389
essence basically giving you the ability

476
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,640
to bond multiple downstream frequency

477
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,860
channels so where you had one downstream

478
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,780
in the past we've actually about allowed

479
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,340
you to think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as ready to stripe</font>

480
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,360

481
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,030
downstream now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could technically</font>

482
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,969
like eight and we had one upstream you

483
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,260
could actually bond for and we're just

484
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically using package with packet</font>

are some are technical some are

financial and it isn't necessarily about

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,570
the equipment it's just about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

that this stuff is backwards

something wireless or you may just run

and they're trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

they get most<font color="#E5E5E5"> bang for the buck and a</font>

00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,529
streams now the device is using the up

598
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,979

599

one

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,610
down below this you see from the

615
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,830
downstream they got this here then they

616
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:37,870
got an attenuator and then they got this

617
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,570
little device called up converter so

the upconvert of your program what

to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that service on and that</font>

632
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,840
helps you build your channel lineup all

633
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,459
of the newer cards that are for the

634
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,379
different types of cmcs is out there

635
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with all different vendors now have</font>

636
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,720
built-in up converter so you don't have

640
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,980
the to buy a card has a built-in up

641
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,600
converter so we have one less piece of

642
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,600
equipment so that's the one we hook in

643
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,110
the motives to right now but just a

644
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,790
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> side note so 44 megahertz is what</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable world so our upstream again I</font>

647
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,719
was explaining earlier our upstream

648
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,720
ranges from five to forty two megahertz

649
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,409
typically that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty low that's</font>

one analog TV channel but if you're

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,370
doing digital I

659
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,639
actually fit 10 digital channels in that

six megahertz block if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't HD I</font>

661
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,690
could probably put<font color="#E5E5E5"> three HD channels in</font>

662
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,610
that six megahertz space but if you're

663
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,870
doing analog is extremely wasteful and

664
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,330
it takes that whole six megahertz

665
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:31,260
carrier that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another reason the FCC is</font>

666
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:34,419
pushing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get rid of analog TV because</font>

667
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:37,600
from 88 to 500 megahertz is the analog

668
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,840
range and that's basically wasted

669
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,600

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,890
rid of the requirement to carry the

673
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,020

674

channels and possibly 15 of giving

depending on compression in each one of

kind of what a capable de ms they

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,530

703
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,200
it real quick the downstream 88 to 880

there are a spectrum<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we could use</font>

710
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,180
that's another reason why you don't have

711
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,919
symmetrical services that's why you

called roll-off filters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> die flex</font>

740

at 27 megahertz so I can't put a docsis

control RC cars that's a 2742 megahertz

746
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:49,690
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of characteristics that</font>

people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think about but your</font>

constantly affected your decibel levels

751
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,910
in the morning and the evening are going

752
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,179
to fluctuate because what happens when

755
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:11,800

more to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it than just the extreme basics</font>

757
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,830
and if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get deeper in</font>

758
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,120
RF like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> take up with me but you</font>

759
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,620
can spend your<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole career just try to</font>

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,239
understand the characteristics of signal

761
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,070
so it's best just to get a good grasp we

762
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,710
have a good understanding of the basics

763
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,600
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then try to continue</font>

770
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,350
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff I don't know</font>

771
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,660
if I don't know what I'm gonna tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

772
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,530
don't know but I'll probably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

773
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,900
look it up for you so we're looking at

774
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,070
the downstream there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else up</font>

775
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,179
to us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I told you the channel with six</font>

776
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,100
megahertz there's one thing I didn't

777
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:57,620
tell you yet and is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modulation</font>

778
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,949
scheme so how are we modulating the

779
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,678
signal well currently you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two</font>

780
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:07,429
choices for modulation 64 qualms or 256

781
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,380
qualms so the raw throughput of a 64

782
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">quam carrier the six megahertz wide is</font>

783
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,650
about 27 megabits per second for data

784
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,370
traffic a 256 quam carrier will give you

785
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:21,320
about 38 megabits per second the other

786
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:22,850
two fields over here where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

787
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,460
about required a minimum CNR that's

788
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,350
actually carried a noise ratio it's not

789
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,669
the same thing as signal-to-noise ratio

790
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,418
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually two different</font>

791
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:35,510
measurements that people mix them up on

792
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,740
the upstream side and again we I'm not

793
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to sit there and read verbatim</font>

794
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,640
every part of this life is well run out

795
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,470
of time this is normally like I cut a

796
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,059
150 slides out of this so there's only

797
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,590
70 here so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad and we</font>

798
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably won't cover all that but</font>

799
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,030
normally the basics class would take a

800
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,799
week to go into with labs to kind of

801
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,360
cover some of this but on the upstream

802
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:55,340
side we actually have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font>

803
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,750
waves we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use so on the downstream</font>

804
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,399
we're locked in its debt at six

805
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,799
megahertz and<font color="#CCCCCC"> x ir b because those are</font>

806
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,840
TV that's that's what the TV industry

807
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,610
did way back when and the FCC gave them

808
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,309
that's how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were a lot and how to</font>

809
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:09,020
give out spectrum well on the upstream

810
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:11,870
side that's more recent that's for like

811
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,490
pay-per-view for the internet stuff so

812
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,830
it was a little more flexible with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

813
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,940
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have different channel</font>

814
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,580
whips<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can select when you're</font>

815
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,190
configuring the router you can do 200

819
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,168
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> even do a 6.4 wide</font>

820
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:36,169
megahertz carrier on the upstream and

821
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:39,590
then down below there again is also

822
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:42,980
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of modulation you have</font>

823
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:44,600
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have qpsk which is robust and</font>

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">can handle noise but doesn't provide</font>

825
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,409
a lot of throughput you have 16 qualms

826
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:56,659
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis 10 11 20 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 are all</font>

828
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,260
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more susceptible to noise but</font>

829
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,670
gives you more throughput so if your

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,840
maintenance guys out there those bucket

831
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:05,360
trucks aren't tightening it up and

832
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,620
fixing that plant daily you're going to

833
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a harder time running 16 quam</font>

834
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,209
without taking a higher bit error rate

835
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,250
or modular modulation error rate

836
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,890
depending on where that you know where

837
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:18,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the failure is you may only be able to</font>

00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qpsk because it's much more robust</font>

839
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,370
and basically just think of it as error

840
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,929
checking if I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> one error i can</font>

assume what it was and fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

842
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,740
take three errors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a row at that point</font>

843
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably can't fix that because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

844
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,350
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I don't know how to</font>

845
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,420
correct that one or zero that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

846
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,250
basic theory here what noise comes in it

847
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:36,890
overrides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of legitimate data and causes</font>

848
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:39,740
his scrambled garble crap and you're in

849
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,860
able to really correct it do error

850
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:48,440
correction on it the throughput ratings

851
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:51,770
here so with<font color="#CCCCCC"> qpsk you got 200 400 800 in</font>

852
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,180
a 1.6<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 3 12 wide channel whiffs you're</font>

853
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,690
not going to see anything out there

854
00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:00,050
today that is smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 1.6 the</font>

855
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">average is a 3.2 wide carrier if the</font>

856
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,250
company that's servicing you thought

857
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,780
ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> got rid of the 10 modems in 11</font>

858
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:08,659
modems and all the motors in their plan

859
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,489
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 then they actually can do a higher</font>

860
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,889
upstream modulation and a bigger channel

861
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:16,209
with they could do the 6.4 wide and they

862
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually can do a 64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qualms upstream</font>

863
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:24,070
which a 16<font color="#E5E5E5"> qualms would give these gives</font>

864
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:28,190
you about 10.24 megabit per second up a

865
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:31,910
64 qualm is somewhere around 24 megabit

866
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:35,360
per second and then there's also other

867
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:37,100
ways to do that too again you have your

868
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,530
required CNR your minimum seeing our

869
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,529
values any questions at this point

870
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:53,409
quam is a modulation type it's it's much

871
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,460
beyond this talk but yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we'd</font>

872
00:34:53,409 --> 00:35:01,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get we'd have to go into some</font>

873
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:03,190
deep math to to explain it it's easier

874
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,869
to just explain this and try to go

875
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,700
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides but basically through</font>

876
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,860
the picture you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red</font>

877
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,390
line would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a downstream and then you</font>

878
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,550
see the other color lines the blue

879
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:13,960
orange and green those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> up streams</font>

880
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,970
remember I told you you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

881
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,940
downstream but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might have multiple</font>

882
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,589
up streams in this case each one of

883
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,350
these streets<font color="#CCCCCC"> are service areas are</font>

884
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:24,730
sharing a downstream which as we just

885
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,160
seen has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more throughput than an</font>

886
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,470
upstream but each service area may have

887
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,210
may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a direct route back to that</font>

888
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:37,868
seems yes on its own upstream so how's

889
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:38,800
that work well each of these up streams

890
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,150
can actually be set at the same

891
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,030
frequency because they're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

892
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:45,310
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> people just because they share</font>

893
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,990
similar downstream doesn't mean that's

894
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:50,740
in a different frequency there's a

895
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,419
diplexer filter there so you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

896
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,129
high frequency here in the low frequency

897
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,050
there and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> combine them together and</font>

898
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:57,609
you feed the customer there's no back

899
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,230
feet across the downstream or the

900
00:35:57,609 --> 00:36:02,230
upstream from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other carrier or</font>

901
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,850
connection so that allows you to

902
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually run the same frequency on your</font>

903
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,450
up streams and run the up streams to

904
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,190
multiple service groups you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

905
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same upstream you can't use upstream</font>

906
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and upstream</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one to the same node</font>

907
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,339
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same frequency</font>

908
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,270
because again you're writing a top each

909
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:23,350
other they may be at different

910
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:25,750
frequencies so how does the cable modem

911
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:31,109
come online anybody have any idea right

912
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:31,109
now besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that know me</font>

913
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,990
you plug it in and how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font>

914
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:41,779
to transfer data and actually

915
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,779
communicating the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmps is it automagic</font>

916
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,839
so at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point if you're if you're not</font>

917
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,330
bored to tears just yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

918
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually explain the cable modem ranging</font>

919
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,710
process and how it comes online because

920
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,810
it is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> semitic it is a systematic</font>

921
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,580
process and when troubleshooting errors

922
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can pretty much figure out where the</font>

923
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,440
problem is by looking at how it ranged

924
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,030
or if it was able to complete ranging

925
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,050
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I mean mother</font>

926
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,700
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us here understand</font>

927
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,140
troubleshooting right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> start at</font>

928
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,868
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 we normally start a layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

929
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,759
right but is it is it plugged in and

930
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:17,760
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is the playdough is it turned</font>

931
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,350
on and that's the basic truck that's the

932
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,640
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory here is when the cable</font>

933
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">modem first gets there right and you</font>

934
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,910
plug it in and you turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on well</font>

935
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,460
what's it going to do well it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

936
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:29,629
scan for a downstream frequency it's got

937
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,350
to listen before it can talk well

938
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's actually encoded in peg on</font>

939
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:38,480
the rfm but there's a special frame

940
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,640
header on the impact frames for docsis

941
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,140
well you can actually a multiple you

942
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,549
could have one cable company but you can

943
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reselling their cable</font>

944
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:48,900
service plant with another<font color="#CCCCCC"> scene PS from</font>

945
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">a competitor or another company on the</font>

946
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">same cable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plant so you got to make sure</font>

947
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,190
the motor was go to the right place well

948
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:57,390
part of the ranging the initial ranging

949
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,190
process the first thing is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

950
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,710
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk it asserts its going to charge</font>

951
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:04,560
scanning frequencies on the downstream

952
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:07,770
and in this example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a</font>

953
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,670
debug session from a cisco modem we can

954
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:13,200
see it's at 537 didn't see nothing so

955
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,450
then it goes next the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next frequency</font>

956
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,850
what why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the next frequency 66</font>

957
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,549
megahertz up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a channel</font>

958
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,200
with North America keeps going

959
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,990
eventually it'll actually see it in here

960
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,470
it says cable modem logged es downstream

961
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,259
64<font color="#E5E5E5"> quam lock acquired it found a</font>

963
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:37,440
i found<font color="#E5E5E5"> my downstream now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i gotta wait</font>

964
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,379
and the wait state at the very last line

965
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,880
there where it says wait UCD state<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

966
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">see d stands for upstream channel</font>

967
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,430

968
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,250
it

969
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,710
not know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate back to the</font>

970
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">cmps it doesn't know what frequency what</font>

modulation scheme what channel width it

972
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:56,440
doesn't understand that yet that's why

973
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,849
it's waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the upstream channel</font>

974
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,290
descriptor because the cmcs and the

975
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:00,520
downstream is always telling everybody

976
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,770
just case someone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come online</font>

977
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,509
it's always screaming out the upstream

978
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,770
requirements for that downstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

979
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,030
you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this downstream bother you</font>

980
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,460
know if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this downstream</font>

981
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,160
by the way I have these associated up

982
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,270
streams at these set parameters if you

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,920
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it goes through</font>

984
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:20,770
the UCD so now it's scanning through and

985
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,690
it actually finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> an upstream upstream</font>

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,040
upstream channel descriptor is telling

988
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,940
it 33 megahertz is the center frequency

when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you comes your</font>

1017
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,170
be different characteristics to the guy

1018
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:37,869
that's closer won't have to transmit his

1019
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,430
loud the guy further away down the plant

higher than the guy that's closer up

1025
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:52,569
there are other ways to combat that the

actual taps they plug your drops in to

sell you the less customers per node you

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:24,020
want right I yet to actually be a cable

company that over subscribes on purpose

1039
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,130
and once to like get ninety percent

1040
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:32,240
bandwidth utilization per node most the

1041
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,710
time I've seen anywhere from a customer

1042
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,319
recently worked with only had 32

1043
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:40,130
customers for fiber note the average<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

about 250 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 depending ninety</font>

not downloading stuff right and that's

1049
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,820
the customers you like they pay you the

1050
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,830
50 70 bucks a month and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't even</font>

1051
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">really use a service then you have the</font>

1052
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like us we want the cheapest cost</font>

1053
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,560
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to</font>

1054

bittorrent that thing until<font color="#E5E5E5"> it bleeds</font>

1055
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,200
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take as much</font>

1056

bandwidth as we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it we are</font>

1057
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:12,500
the bad customers so the theory goes you

1058
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,580
know five percent of your babe you know

1059
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,140
one hundred percent of you like ninety

1060
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,759
percent your bandwidth is actually being

1061
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,589
utilized by like the top two percent of

1062
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers like only two but here's</font>

1063
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,410
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two it's only like two percent your</font>

1064
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,930
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using most your van with</font>

1065
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,790
everybody else is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing nothing</font>

1066
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:30,410
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their windows updates and</font>

1067
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:34,790
like searching on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google so kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> acts</font>

1068
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:36,529
the rage process so this is debugging

1069
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:40,700
actually on a cable modem and this is

1070
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:42,200
basically this is a physical console

1071
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,060
into a cable modem I'm actually looking

1072
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,980
at its process and the messages it does

1073
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,810
i'm watching at each stage as it tries

1074
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come online</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get an IP</font>

1075
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,350
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hit the internet so the</font>

1076
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">first stage was it scans the downstream</font>

1077
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,940
it finds a frequency that is actually

1078
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">docsis once it finds that downstream it</font>

1079
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,780
waits for a depth stream channel

1080
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,450
descriptor a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we found that 33</font>

1081
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:04,250
megahertz well now in the raging process

1082
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,040
we actually have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on getting our</font>

1083
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,980
power levels correct so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font>

1084
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:13,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I say the same TS can you</font>

1085
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:16,100
me and I wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> response on the</font>

1086
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,480
downstream that'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response my</font>

1087
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,529
assumption is I didn't speak loud enough

1088
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,910
you can you hear me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit louder</font>

1089
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:27,530
and I keep screaming until finally I get

1090
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:29,690
a response so in this debug here you see

1091
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:34,000
that it starts at six TV then it goes to

1092
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:36,619
nine then 12 then 15 then 18 and then

1093
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,980
write their range response message

1094
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:41,660
received it got word back that the CHS

1095
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,730
could hear it at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same TS</font>

1096
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,540
might say do why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you screaming turn your</font>

1097
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:50,119
level down<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 DB or I can barely hear you</font>

1098
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,920
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little louder but that's</font>

1099
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:54,980
arranging process that's ranging state

1100

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called in it or one and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,320
works ice cream can you hear me the same

1104
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:08,750
she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> came exit I can hear you by the</font>

1105
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:10,520
way don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yell at me for so the next</font>

1106
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,109
part of it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less the</font>

1107
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,490
fine-tuning part where he says hey yeah

1108
00:44:12,109 --> 00:44:18,259
I hear you you're too loud you're too

1109
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:20,540
quiet duo power adjustment for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1110
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,010
that's done the last stages ranging

1111
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:27,529
complete we're good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can talk</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cts but I don't know what my you</font>

1113
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,250
know that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an IP address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1115
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,200
I have is a mac address I don't know

1116
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,430
what my service levels are what's my

1117
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,549
upload and download speeds suppose to be

1118
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,690
set to do I have devices hooked into my

1119
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,030
ethernet port and do they need IP

1120
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,890
addresses so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done at this point</font>

1121
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,890
was give the five level activity done

1122
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,990
and now i'm at layer 2 next stage

1123
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,160
familiar to is going to be layer 3 we

1124
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,830
need an IP address we need more

1125
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,649
information so we go into the what's

1126
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:59,210
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the provisioning stage so in the</font>

1127
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,859
provisioning stage and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1128
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a passion a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1129
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,880
slides because they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what</font>

1130
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,500
I've already said twice probably but and

1131
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,790
the provisioning stage the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing</font>

1132
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,510
we're going to do is the modem is now

1133
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:15,350
online but it has not completely

1134
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:17,930
finished registering so if I'm allure to

1135
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:20,779
device and I'm in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unquote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subnet</font>

1136
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,319
or domain right and I need to EGP but

1137
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,299
this guy is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on another network</font>

1138
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,699
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to him as a liar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to device can I</font>

1139
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:31,288
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ken to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makana mac address be</font>

1140
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:33,599
routed know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to depend on the</font>

1141
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:39,839
CMT<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to relay my information if the</font>

1142
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:45,839
dhcp server is somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else yes but</font>

1143
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:49,589
it's called cable helper and the CLI so

1144
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,019
i sent a dhp discover the CMT s realize

1145
00:45:49,589 --> 00:45:53,369
that action out to the dhcp server now

1146
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:56,069
the dhcp server is directly connected

1147
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,599
the CMT s still wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be involved it</font>

1148
00:45:56,069 --> 00:46:00,089
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because at</font>

1149
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,039
the other day there are some security

1150
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:05,549
issues here we have to make sure the

1151
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:07,229
correct DSP server is responding so you

1152
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:08,999
know your normal discover offer received

1153
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:10,468
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dora process when it comes with dhcp</font>

1154
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,660
so this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little lame or</font>

1155
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:17,910
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yeah I hear you offer offer</font>

1156
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:21,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledgement ok so our modem now has</font>

1157
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:23,368
its IP address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hfc</font>

1158
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:25,049
address it's normally a 10 or 192 it's a

1159
00:46:23,369 --> 00:46:27,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">private network between the cable modem</font>

1160
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:31,739
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CMT s no computers behind it yet</font>

1161
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,390
just the modem itself and the CMT s so

1162
00:46:31,739 --> 00:46:34,529
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually two separate networks</font>

1163
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,328
here when you plug your computer in

1164
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:38,009
you're going over basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a media</font>

1165
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:40,109
converter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media converter has</font>

1166
00:46:38,009 --> 00:46:41,579
its own layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 connectivity to the CMT</font>

1167
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:43,469
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable modem CFG has have their</font>

1168
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,449
own IP addressing structure over the hfc

1169
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:48,569
interface or the coaxial cable network

1170
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:51,119
and then on top of that it passes along

1171
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:53,219
IP addresses to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers devices</font>

1172
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,759
your linksys router or whatever d-link

1173
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:59,719
whatever you have or your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers well</font>

1174
00:46:56,759 --> 00:46:59,719
in the provisioning process

1175
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:11,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I suppose get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1176
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:13,199
slices<font color="#E5E5E5"> right over the load time but once</font>

1177
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:14,339
i get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhp address and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1178
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,959
have an IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the cape modem</font>

1179
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,359
itself I need something called tu t or

1180
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:20,368
time of day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I ever dealt with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1181
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:28,439
time at a server maybe I have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1182
00:47:20,369 --> 00:47:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that is not that timing there is a</font>

1183
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:32,459
frequency timing oh that's a little bit

1184
00:47:29,609 --> 00:47:33,929
different the time of day server is kind

1185
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:35,069
of funny but have you ever turned a

1186
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:37,289
device on they didn't have a bios

1187
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:41,189
battery what date did it give you

1188
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:42,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1970 well the motor was going</font>

1189
00:47:41,189 --> 00:47:44,368
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because it doesn't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1190
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:46,140
bios better<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else so it needs a</font>

1191
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:48,119
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of day server because any time it</font>

1192
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,709
has a log or an error or an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue it</font>

1193
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:52,079
saves<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to its own little log saw log</font>

1194
00:47:49,709 --> 00:47:53,669
server internally and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1195
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,729
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to accurately timestamp that</font>

1196
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:59,719
information so you know if I had a flap

1197
00:47:56,729 --> 00:48:02,819
at this point it's not 1970 was in 2010

1198
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:04,829
this date this time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond so</font>

1199
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:08,459
as you're coming up party of a

1200
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:11,609
provisioning process<font color="#CCCCCC"> through RFC 868 is</font>

1201
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:12,719
a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a server once you do your time</font>

1202
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:15,328
at a server then you can move on the

1203
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,880
process the next process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

1204
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:20,910
the tftp so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the cable</font>

1205
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,809
modem is requesting its config file from

1206
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:26,399
the msos THV server this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

1207
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:28,189
provide the modem information it could

1208
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,689
even be providing it a firmware upgrade

1209
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:31,828
but this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the upstream and</font>

1210
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:34,078
downstream filters the caps

00:48:31,829 --> 00:48:36,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote that some people want to</font>

1212
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,719
break it's also going to provide

1213
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:42,209
protection for the customer you may not

1214
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:44,039
want your your information and your some

1215
00:48:42,209 --> 00:48:45,928
of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff filtered but it's</font>

1216
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:48,269
always probably not a bad idea if

1217
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:51,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known important numbers are blocked</font>

1218
00:48:48,269 --> 00:48:53,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i'm not talking about port 80</font>

1219
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:55,650
because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a web server i'm</font>

1220
00:48:53,009 --> 00:48:57,239
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> known exploit ports it is</font>

1221
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,420
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in the modems config</font>

1222
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:02,219
file port filters are a meany access

1223
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,630
control list into it where it knows that

1224
00:49:02,219 --> 00:49:06,599
it doesn't need to speak to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ten</font>

1225
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,459
Network it knows that it shouldn't go

1226
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,959
here or shouldn't go there they're very

1227
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:11,759
limited and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very small and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1228
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:12,779
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only put a couple in there but nine</font>

1229
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:14,699
times out of ten those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1230
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:16,019
actually protect the customer there are

1231
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:17,660
some service limiting ones you can put

1232
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,919
in there like port 80 and

1233
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,200
keep people for something you actually

1234
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,819
running an email server because we all

1235
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,069
love spam and we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody to have</font>

1236
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:26,270
a spam server but there's some of the

1237
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:32,180
things that it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be put in the config</font>

1238
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:34,130
file maximum IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> request</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1239
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">another one so if your cable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming only</font>

1240
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives you one IP the they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1241
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,829
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there so if you ever plugged a</font>

1242
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:43,879
computer into a cable modem you got it

1243
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:45,349
online everything else that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

1244
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch it over something else and you</font>

1245
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,680
plug it in doesn't work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta power</font>

1246
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,559
cycle the thing well because i had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font>

1247
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">CP hosts file in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there said one and it</font>

1248
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">already knows the mac address of the guy</font>

1249
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was plugged into it so you've got</font>

1250
00:49:53,809 --> 00:50:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to clear it out by resetting it that's</font>

1251
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:02,359
another thing too so once we actually

1252
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:06,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">finish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tftp process the last stage</font>

1253
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:10,279
is actually option files we're not going

1254
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:13,669
to go into that registration request for

1255
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,579
official response once it finishes its

1256
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:19,280
registration there is one more stage

privacy interface that's the encryption

1259
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:29,119
so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about every cable company that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1260
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:32,180

00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea so V</font>

1264
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:41,930
PIR BPI plus depending on what version

00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:44,538
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis baseline privacy interface so</font>

1266
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,180
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that well basically it's a king</font>

1267
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:49,880
mechanism where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can encrypt the data</font>

1268
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,740
going down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer I can encrypt</font>

1269
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,049
that data so only<font color="#E5E5E5"> that modem can</font>

1270
00:50:51,740 --> 00:51:01,038
unencrypted it and read it so there's no

1271
00:50:54,049 --> 00:51:03,259
snooping BPI plus came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis 11 and</font>

1272
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:05,390
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually added an additional field</font>

1273
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,770
so BPI the baseline privacy interface

1274
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,470
what's Ted up to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers</font>

1275
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,940
privacy you don't people sniffing your

1276
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,578
banking information you can't you can

1277
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,799
sniff on a dog in a data network there's

1278
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:17,170
ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that was talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to DEFCON the</font>

1279
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:19,490
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I bring up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON is</font>

1280
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:24,529
everybody uses BPI so the talk was

1281
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:28,339
useless but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is BPI plus that came</font>

1282
00:51:24,529 --> 00:51:29,420
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis 11 BPI plus went beyond is</font>

1283
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:30,558
protecting the customer but then

1284
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:34,950
protecting the cable

1285
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:38,040
so with BPI it didn't really verify that

1286
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:39,270
if the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> was cloned or not so you</font>

1287
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have two devices with the same</font>

1288
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,530
magnetars in the network because they

1289
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't work right so with with depending</font>

1290
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,710
on what vendor feature code you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

1291
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:48,210
will ignore the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> one or they both</font>

1292
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:51,359
get on they'll both get knocked off line

1293
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:52,890
depending on features but with BPI you

1294
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,390
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data so nobody's getting</font>

1295
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,609
the data stolen but you're not

1296
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,980
preventing theft of service BPI plus

1297
00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:01,230
they actually had the manufacturers

1298
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,359
inject x509certificate into the modems

1299
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,770
firmware that's actually built into the

1300
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,990
modem that's signed with the frequency

1301
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:08,940
to a root certificate that CA verisign

to replicate it what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:52,940
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've changed the whole</font>

1321
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,759
idea on it and it's actually 256 AES

1322
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:57,470
encryption now and the the rekeying can

1323
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,400
be said is as low as every five minutes

1324
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:04,129
per device so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be really</font>

1325
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:05,330
hard to break that encryption and most

1326
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:10,790
of us can't afford the equipment and

1327
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:13,160
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the modem is always going</font>

maintenance functionality it's almost

1336
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:33,680
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> heartbeat that's what I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

1337
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,350
right there maintenance so at least one

00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,680
every 30 seconds it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> expecting to see</font>

each modem in the plan what they didn't

1340
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:46,069
touch so the VXR<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have upstairs the CMT</font>

capable of supporting easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5000 modems</font>

1343
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,500

1344
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:56,150
the small one the one I normally work

1345
00:53:54,500 --> 00:54:01,940
with my customers on is the cisco ten

1346
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:05,540
thousand twelve or called 10k 64,000

1347
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,070
cable modems / chassis but if you're

1348
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,259
providing any real service you're going

1349
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:12,950
to probably have it around 20,000 to

1350
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,880
30,000 so the way negress ports and some

1351
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,730
of the newer stuff of doctors here

1352
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:19,640
because you're increasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

1353
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:22,310
in the speed per customer you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

having 10 gig interfaces and multiple to

1356
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:31,460
engage interfaces so I'm just about out

1357
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:35,480
of time this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer getting</font>

up streams 20 down stream's then on top

1365
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:57,500
of that there's the ability to do what's

1366
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:59,600
called MC mts modular see if yes we're

1367
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,700
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the when the high-capacity Wayne</font>

00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:08,450
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can buy these little koala</font>

modulator and i can add like 24 channels

1372
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,750
per one you and just start stacking them

1373
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:15,170
and add 24 more down terms on top of

1374
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotten more cost effective</font>

1375
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:18,170
to be a cable company with these newer

00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:21,770
technologies the cost has come down a

00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:23,270
lot to any questions at this time this

1378
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:29,110
is all product literature stuff so it's

1379
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:29,110
not really too deep good

1380
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,000
no if if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable company one to pull</font>

00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,820
ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of people don't turn the</font>

1396
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,900
modems off that they actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1397
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,270
to scale to make sure that there's no

1398
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,590
outages by seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> those online motives</font>

1399
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:18,200
because they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> every 30 seconds</font>

1400
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:18,200
anyway what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1401
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:28,890
they're pretty generic it depends on the

1402
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:30,240
vendor but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot you can do</font>

1403
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,470
there it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to trigger anything if</font>

1404
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,569
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> screwing with your modem</font>

1405
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:36,029
they're already going to see for the

1406
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:38,970
most part because<font color="#CCCCCC"> your config file</font>

1407
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:40,230
either one you don't have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 private</font>

1408
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:44,220
key from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor so you're not going</font>

1409
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:45,650
to modify that too if you change your

1410
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:48,240
bin file name they're going to see it

1411
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,799
because they're talking every 30 seconds

1412
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,930
so I know what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the changes</font>

1413
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:54,210
even beyond signal level I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font>

1414
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:56,640
pull that plus if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tried to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clone a</font>

1415
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:59,490
device one you would have to be on a

1416
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,960
different CMT s and I would see<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

1417
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,220
you were and I would see your signal

1418
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,809
characteristics like it pretty much

1419
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,578
guess where you're at physically in the

1420
00:57:03,809 --> 00:57:07,380
real world I could overlay my cable

1421
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:09,150
plant over google maps and then have a

1422
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,980
little dot show up like<font color="#E5E5E5"> right your house</font>

1423
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,329
the only time they get so slightly

1424
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,660
difficult when it's an apartment complex

1425
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:27,569
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the houses are so close together</font>

1426
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:31,910
I'm out of time so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and room</font>

1427
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:31,910
226 six<font color="#CCCCCC"> o'clock related</font>
