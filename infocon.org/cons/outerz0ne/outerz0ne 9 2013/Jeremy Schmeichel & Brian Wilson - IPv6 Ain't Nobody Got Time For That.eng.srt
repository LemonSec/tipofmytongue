7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,840
ipv6 we here last year we talked a

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,150
little bit about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

15
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,599

right transitioning to IP version 6

61
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,170
Brian you want to say our meetings

62
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:39,280
apparently we support about about one

63
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,640
and a half million cable modern devices

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,100
just put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it closer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your mouth yeah</font>

their problems out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big</font>

76
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,579
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is they're out of IP for</font>

77
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,640
space and they have to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

78
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,110
to get to IP version 6 so last year when

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,660
we're here we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

80
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,310
solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are to mitigate the</font>

81
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,329
exhaustion of IP version 4 whether

82
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,589
that's brokering with Aaron and the

83
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,830
specified transfer listing service that

84
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,270
they have you know reclamation of IP

85
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,669
version 4 addresses through using

86
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,760
private addresses for cable modems MTA

87
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:34,370
so on so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then hardware and</font>

88
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,659
software net so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

89
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,220
of experience with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these over the past</font>

90
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,190
year just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some review IP version 4</font>

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,979
deployed in the 80s internet protocol

92
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,320
version 6 was brought up in a round 1999

93
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the differences in the address</font>

94
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,440
size the 32-bit versus 128-bit

95
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,770
hexadecimal the addressing format

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,540
kind of displayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> there your prefix</font>

97
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,789
notation is a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier in IP</font>

98
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,340
version 4 versus IP version 6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

99
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,780
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sheer number of addresses and</font>

100
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,690
even the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deployed in on IP version 6</font>

101
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,690
there's been so many changes since 1999

102
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,310
that if you were a compliant at that

103
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,140
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time they are you probably be</font>

104
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:19,490
compliant today so even today they're

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,810
still adding and updating the spec yeah

106
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,190
changes every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually really</font>

107
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting if you've watched the way</font>

108
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,700
that IP version 6 has evolved over time

109
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,760
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the biggest things</font>

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,620
with IP version 4 is a network address

111
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,890
translation that became very necessary

112
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,420
in the 90s due to the pending exhaustion

113
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,760
everybody knew eventually we're going to

114
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,010
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of address space so NAT was</font>

115
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,080
invented as you know kind of a solution

116
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that obviously an IP version 6</font>

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,919
there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know real no real need for</font>

118
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,229
net so at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time there was a</font>

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,720
form of net and IP version 6 but that's

120
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,460
been stripped out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol since</font>

121
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,630
so talking more about IP version 4 then

122
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,330
there was you know highly limited

123
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,990
address space<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT was seen as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bane</font>

124
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,250
of innovation<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they just</font>

125
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,260
abandoned yeah it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a band-aid I</font>

126
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,510
mean it basically took your public

127
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,030
addresses and you shared either a single

128
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,039
or multiple public addresses and that

129
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,770
resulted<font color="#CCCCCC"> in issues with application</font>

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,960
layer gateways several devices that

131
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,909
depended on you know functionality of

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,859
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the ports available on the</font>

133
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,400
public address space just broke when it

134
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">came to using that so over time there</font>

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,060
were solutions that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed</font>

136
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,710
around that but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue so in</font>

137
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,730
IP version 6 they rip NAT out and

138
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,400
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plenty of space for everybody</font>

139
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that is a bad thing when you do that</font>

140
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,000
and that and that so a lot of cases

141
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,340
you'll see where you're trying to

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,380
reserve IP space or control users<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

143
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,429
hotel environment they may double or

144
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,440
triple match it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got the</font>

145
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,830
internet so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks a lot of tools</font>

you may use<font color="#E5E5E5"> near your computer</font>

147
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,870
so IP version 4<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus IP version 6 i</font>

148
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,960
wish i had the mortal kombat theme here

149
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:57,610
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't just in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regards to the sheer</font>

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,140
number of addresses this is again this

151
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:05,860
is just review you know have about 4.3

152
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:08,620
billion roughly if you round up of which

153
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,030
only 3.7 billion are actually publicly

154
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,040
addressable the rest are either private

155
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,119
or shared address space defined by

156
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:20,320
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked so on and so forth ipv6</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you get to the if I'm if I'm going to</font>

164
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,140
point right here is IP version 4 roughly

165
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,630
and then the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up is all</font>

166
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:58,300
of IP version 6 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think somebody</font>

167
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,980
calculated there was a IP address for

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,790
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> three square feet in the Milky Way</font>

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,660
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a cutter little</font>

172
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,030
few more so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know the funny</font>

173
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,130
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that the funny thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

174
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,169
that is when IP version 4 first came out

175
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,550
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI na was just like here</font>

176
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,680
take this implement it use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your</font>

177
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,030
network I was experimental to it was

178
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,470
experimental<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that point in time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

179
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,820
people took<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented it</font>

180
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,930
and oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> gosh now we're out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of space</font>

181
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,520
they're doing the same thing with IP

182
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,169
version 6 they're giving out these huge

183
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,049
allocations to people saying here please

184
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">take it use it implements it no real</font>

185
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:41,260
regard for what happens if we run out of

186
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,390
these huge allocations that you're

187
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,160
sending to us well know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the idea in</font>

188
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,240
regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the huge allocations are</font>

189
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,819
giving out now is that you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> never need</font>

190
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,530
another one hopefully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron recently</font>

191
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,900
modified their policies instead of just

192
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,720
handing out / 32 s of IP version 6 which

193
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,720
was a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in IP version 4 but</font>

194
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,310
is a lot in IP version 6 they're

195
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,630
actually allowing you to get smaller

196
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,130
allocations and

197
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,750
returning some of that address space to

198
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,220
pay less per year because people just

199
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,570
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that much and they also</font>

200
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,950
supposedly they're not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give out</font>

201
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,960
more than fifteen percent of the whole

00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,250
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space initially so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're Reese</font>

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,460
opposable that's what they say so

204
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,270
basically go request for ipv6 addresses

205
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,340
are going to give you pretty much

206
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,840
whatever you ask for but you will you

207
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,810
know you will pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it your annually</font>

208
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,950
with Aaron but<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposedly they're only</font>

209
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,839
going to give out the first fifteen

210
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,610
percent and then start you know locking

211
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,560
it down a little bit supposedly until

212
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,850
the spec is revised as they say so the

213
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,689
image you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see at the bottom your screen</font>

214
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:38,500
here Aaron IP version space for

215
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,930
available this 2.48 / eights remaining

216
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,700
basically we're out pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much I mean</font>

217
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the global registry is completely out</font>

218
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,540
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the bad space I mean this is</font>

219
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,240
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bogue andheri the blacklist</font>

220
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,380
space they got back even if you got an

221
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,370
address block in this there's a good

222
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,020
chance you won't give to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

223
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,350
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> because these are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

224
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,840
addresses well<font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron aaron has said as</font>

225
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,730
depletion occurs as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the address</font>

226
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,260
space starts to run out they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

227
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to run into that nasty address</font>

228
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,350
space that's just really the dirty

229
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,910
bottom of the barrel stuff and they

230
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,310
won't have time to scrub it completely

231
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,750
because people are so hungry<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

232
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,069
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space again that they're just</font>

233
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to kind of look at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

234
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,790
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we cleaned it up in here</font>

235
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:21,069
have it yeah the fans exceeding the

236
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:24,310
supply so it's good stuff so here's a

237
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,660
beautiful chart showing about where

238
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,160
we're at right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting line</font>

239
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,150
here is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at the blue line</font>

240
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,939
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asian-pacific allocations</font>

241
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:37,270
it's like all of a sudden they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

242
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that again actually the funny thing</font>

243
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,660
about it is I had written<font color="#CCCCCC"> down here that</font>

244
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,090
wonderful reference to there will be

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">blood they actually approved</font>

246
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-regional transfers so the</font>

247
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:53,140
asia-pacific folks can drink Aaron's

little purple line here this is aaron

250

going down steadily steadily steadily<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

251
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,780
expect before the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year for</font>

252
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure Aaron will be completely exhausted</font>

253
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's talks of some organizations</font>

254
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,300
in Asia or even the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. possibly buying</font>

255
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,860
companies of South America to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

256
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,849
address space

257
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,100
so they can go ahead and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> locking</font>

258
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,540
in outer space and work on transfers so

259
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,530
technically its regional you're supposed

260
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,449
to keep the address blocks within the

261
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,709
region but now it's gotten so low where

262
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,900
they're allowing some exceptions to the

263
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,300
rule and<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger companies are actually</font>

264
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">going and looking to find cheaper</font>

265
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,709
solutions to get address space because

266
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,990
the cost of an address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is anywhere from</font>

267
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,220
five to fourteen dollars right now and

268
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,360
it's not going to go down it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

269
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:43,810
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up that's ridiculous</font>

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I actually you know because sorry how

271
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,729
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it's not better all right</font>

272
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,320
we're good what I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

273
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,780
was actually talking because we work in

274
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,740
the cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry we have a lot of</font>

275
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,970
experience working with different

276
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,710
providers talking with them about

277
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,630
whether they get address space from

278
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,370
their direct service provider because

279
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,689
even cable providers have to get

280
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,580
internet circuit from somewhere whether

281
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,600
that's 80 or comcast in this case

282
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,120
comcast is getting ready to charge this

283
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,700
guy 400 bucks a month for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a / 24 s worth</font>

284
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,150
of IP address space<font color="#E5E5E5"> juicy address is not</font>

285
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,700
bandwidth<font color="#CCCCCC"> per month so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

286

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,720
for like fifteen hundred dollars

288
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,460
annually so but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is Aaron's</font>

289
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,870
about out so you know what are these

290
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,550
smaller service provider is going to do

291
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,590
when it runs out then we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back into</font>

292
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,469
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole mitigating ipv4 exhaustion</font>

293
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,330
brokering black market IP addresses so

294
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:36,100
but the companies are looking at

295
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,340
acquiring other companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're</font>

296
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,540
actually viewing the IP address

297
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,250
resources that companies have as an

asset and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's actually a</font>

299
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:48,580
measurable asset now due to the

300
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:50,200
depletion so last year IP version 6 was

301
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,740
launched

302
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh-huh it's climbing high but yeah it's</font>

303
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not past four point three percent</font>

304
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,080
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Google's graph the toll</font>

305
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,960
disclosure here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the</font>

306
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,450
traffic all native IP version 6 traffic

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,160
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1.3 percent as of yesterday when i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pulled the graph or a couple days ago I</font>

310
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:16,420
guess but still it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot not a lot</font>

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of native IP version 6 traffic yet so</font>

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,870
even though it's out there it's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,100
not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using IP version 6</font>

315
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,890
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's still</font>

consumer challenges to a certain extent

317
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,730
windows XP last year had like thirty

318
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:34,740
five percent penetration still it's down

319
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:39,670
to about 17.6 1078 the kingpins for sure

320
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:42,240
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ate so much as seven but the problem</font>

321
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">is most people aren't connecting their</font>

322
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,790
individual machines directly to their

323
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,110
internet connection usually have a

324
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,569
router or something like that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

325
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,980
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't usually replace</font>

326
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,360
their routers unless they break so you

327
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably have a 56 year old router</font>

328
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,200
sitting in your house for most folks

329
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,850
anyway that there's no chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will do</font>

330
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,610
IP version 6 at least with the way the

331
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,320
spec exists today so the interesting

332
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,940
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our labs is</font>

333
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,370
even different consumer routers

334
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,690
implement the spec differently we'll

335
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,210
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about that more in a</font>

336
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:16,180
bit but I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody heard</font>

337
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,260
about the debacle well we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

338
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,209
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second but they remember the</font>

339
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,840
cisco linksys debacle<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think was last</font>

340
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:27,990
summer where they did a forced cloud

341
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:30,990
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> on all the consumer devices and</font>

342
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,990
basically

343
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:38,950
drew me for a loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're forced update</font>

344
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,120
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer devices and said hey you</font>

345
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,410
guys gotta register for our cloud

346
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,930
service if you want to use your internet

347
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,180
connection well you can about imagine

348
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,089
exactly how well the consumers took to

349
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,339
being told what they have to do so that

350
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,420
was a big issue for linksys but you have

351
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,540
to understand what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

352
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,530
do is from my perspective new<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

353
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,430
understand what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were trying to get</font>

354
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,800
out they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it so that</font>

355
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the linksys routers are fully</font>

356
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,660
capable and updated to the latest

357
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,099
firmware so they can accept v6 addresses

358
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,900
and read<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data but no I'm</font>

359
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,250
just kidding they probably a good

360
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,530
attention they went about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong way</font>

361
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,450
yeah so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a lesson learned</font>

362
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,740
hard and now Cisco is actually selling

363
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,590
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sister belkin so it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

364
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,600
anyway but comcast actually there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

365
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,310
news article this week they fully

366
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,340
deployed IP version 6 on all of their

367
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,869
eres infrastructure I'm not exactly sure

368
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,340
since I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't work for comcast how that</font>

369
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,760
compares to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco infrastructure</font>

370
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,470
but you know probably 5050 roughly that

371
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,850
is a milestone I mean there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

372
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,300
growing pains again we're getting into

373
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,920
the consumer router differences here we

374
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,550
have a lab at the company we work for

375
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,969
we've got a cisco 7246 vxr ipv6 is

376
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,990
aliens yes by the way and we've got you

377
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,310
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable bundle on there that's</font>

378
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,310
configured with all the necessary

379
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:54,069
commands to make dhcpv6 work because in

380
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,750
the cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> world you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use DHCP in</font>

381
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,700
order to track your customers so if you

382
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,500
get a clear subpoena requests on

383
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,390
subpoena is not a big deal but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clea yeah</font>

384
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,470
that one you got to worry about and some

385
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,790
of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things do is you just need</font>

386
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,250
to control out the allocations as you

387
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,260
issue amount so you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

388
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,030
platform so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the</font>

389
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,860
same basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory going instead of just</font>

390
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,870
throwing<font color="#E5E5E5"> statics out there you need to</font>

391
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,940
stick with<font color="#CCCCCC"> gcp and one of the first</font>

392
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,710
things you run into is<font color="#E5E5E5"> d HP v6 this is</font>

393
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,480
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only supported very few operating</font>

394
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,160
systems you got to be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

395
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,800
Mac you got to be at least snow lion to

396
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,689
even see it and then on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 7 and 8</font>

397
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,120
mm-hmm what

398
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Snow Leopard whatever was mal mine it's</font>

399
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,630
some the line is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Josh's new operating</font>

400
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,870
system that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't released yet</font>

401
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,100
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just no I'm just kidding but um</font>

402
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,019
anyway was interesting because we have

403
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,430
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different router vendors in our</font>

404
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,019
lab right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we need to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a netgear</font>

405
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,769
and the belkin but we don't have yet but

406
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,509
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sous d-link and a linksys</font>

407
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,220
the linksys router we were working on it

408
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,810
and it would accept an IP version 6

409
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,339
address but it wouldn't hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything to</font>

410
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,689
the devices behind it unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> he put it</font>

411
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,790
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> bridge mode which is really strange</font>

412
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,620
and then asus just didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

413
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,209
nice until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did a firmware update the</font>

414
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,250
d-link won't accept an individual IP

415
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,899
address that has to get a / 64

416
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,000
allocation so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hand out addresses</font>

417
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices behind it it's very greedy</font>

418
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,619
so it's it's really goofy<font color="#CCCCCC"> because every</font>

419
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,230
vendor has a different implementation so

420
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,879
as we move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward hopefully you know a</font>

421
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,039
firmer standard will be developed but

422
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,449
for now there definitely are a lot of

423
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,189
differences in the consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> router is</font>

424
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,199
available to people that go to Walmart

425
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,030
and buy a router today and our idea with

426
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,010
our testing is to basically match up

427
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,869
what a consumer can purchase because you

428
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,760
know when you're dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an ISP</font>

429
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,928
unless they're giving you the equipment

430
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,700
you're probably gonna want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to use</font>

431
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:34,740
whatever you have so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

432
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what what they can go pick up</font>

433
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,190
at best buy or walmart and how

434
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:40,500
compatible it really is so we can kind

435
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,720
of gold certified devices we know work

436
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then say you can use what you want</font>

437
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,500
but we can we can support these devices

438
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:51,360
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to get ahead the</font>

439
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ballgame well trying to the complexity</font>

440
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,299
in regards to the configuration so it

441
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,490
was interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> he brought up static</font>

442
00:17:54,299 --> 00:18:00,139
addressing earlier who's going to type a

443
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:02,450
static IP v6 address into their device

444
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,560
you'll probably do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it once you'll do it</font>

445
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,940
once but you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

446
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,610
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again everybody know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to copy and</font>

447
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,290
paste it's a very useful skill when it

448
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:15,250
comes to any person<font color="#E5E5E5"> six one of the other</font>

449
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:16,940
say what that's right truncation

450
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,380
abbreviate we're actually going to get

451
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,910
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a little bit but I'm</font>

452
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,290
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the carrier great</font>

453
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,640
night issues too so like he was saying

454
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,960
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have NAT on top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mat on top</font>

455
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,000
of net on top of well yeah if you run

456
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,920
into some problems things break not

457
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,730
everything works as intended because it

458
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,800
wasn't designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> function like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

459
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,720
you know your video streaming your skype

460
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,940
calls you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there netflix and their</font>

461
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">xbox don't work they call and call and</font>

462
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,660
they call and they are very upset<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

463
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,310
yeah you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the more</font>

464
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,990
compliments to keep them up on on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is compatible with their</font>

466
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,400
current devices and a lot of devices in

467
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,770
the house won't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> iv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compatible so you</font>

468
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,080
have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of edge device</font>

469
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:02,000
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't get online and play with</font>

470
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:04,429
my pandas in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of warcraft to</font>

471
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,830
access that's right but I be virgin<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

472
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,960
has ipsec built-in doesn't it yeah yeah

473
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,939
it does it does make end-to-end

474
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,000
encryption a lot easier in IP version 6

475
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,070
but it's not backwards compatible it

476
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,660
introduces a whole host of new problems

477
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,860
when you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement a brand</font>

478
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,770
new protocol on your network this is

479
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:29,629
actually one of my favorite slides the

480
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:31,400
link local address in regards to how

481
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> host communicate on a network</font>

482
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,610
so what we've seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lab testing is</font>

483
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:39,110
when a host comes online it's a sign it

484
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,090
assigns itself its own link local

485
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,189
address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the 169 254</font>

486
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses an IP version 4 but it</font>

487
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:50,360
actually has a use IP version 6 its the

488
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:52,970
hole let's see fe 80 followed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5854</font>

489
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,179
bits of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeros the last 64 bits is the 48</font>

490
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,250
bit mac address with FF fe stucked in

491
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,320
the middle so if you know if you're on a

492
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,350
network and you know link local

493
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,669
addresses every link local address has

494
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,899
that devices MAC address in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

495
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,340
with FF<font color="#CCCCCC"> GE and</font>

496
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,270
you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip that right out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

497
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,409
look I've got a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac address table</font>

498
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,690
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a security flaw</font>

499
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,620
unfortunately all hosts when they come

500
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,630
online especially if they're using

501
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcpv6 or slack a stateless</font>

502
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto-configuration they'll use their</font>

503
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,160
link local address to talk to their

504
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,470
local router and say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need an IP</font>

505
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,240
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey what's the address of this</font>

506
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,190
neighbor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and</font>

507
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,080
so forth so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more traffic</font>

508
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,120
on an ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that you have to be</font>

509
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,659
mindful of in regards to what we had an

510
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,370
IP version 4 let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intrusion</font>

511
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,110
detection intrusion prevention systems

512
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,709
they don't understand the traffic

513
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,320
they're going to drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well ipv4 is</font>

514
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,550
incompatible with IP version 6 ipv6

515
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,250
isn't backwards compatible with version

516
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:56,570
4 so you have to have network devices

517
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,620
that understand both and are capable of

518
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,939
filtering both yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font>

519
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,310
to run dual stack and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

520
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,740
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to correctly interpret all</font>

521
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,720
the standards within IP version 6 any of

522
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,790
the security security potential risks

523
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,020
you have there and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

524
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> landscape as we move</font>

525
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,450
forward so if you you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

526
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,159
an exploit it may not work<font color="#CCCCCC"> in v4 because</font>

527
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,960
it's locked down and you know the

528
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">security systems in place can prolong</font>

529
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,270
that but with ipv6 every device in the

530
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,010
network's public

531
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,389
it's connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet so it's</font>

532
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,540
out there so how do you protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

533
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,340
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually pretty interesting</font>

534
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,230
that was there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tat an attack that</font>

535
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">I read about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this week while I was</font>

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:38,750
prepping<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this talk in regards to</font>

537
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,820
pack lamp packet amplification so the

538
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,250
router header in IP version 6 is a

539
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,810
simplified version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the v4 header what</font>

540
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,520
you can do is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can place a</font>

541
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,560
zero and the routing header of each

542
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,600
packet it causes them to travel<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

543
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">dilute path so the ping-pong exploits</font>

544
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,080
take advantage of the wealth of / 64

545
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,760
subnets available in the protocol that's

546
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">what every router is going to get in</font>

547
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,120
your system is they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a /</font>

548
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,490
64 so they can delegate addresses to

549
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,290
devices behind them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it basically</font>

550
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:05,710
allows attackers to send packets from

551
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:10,310
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-existent connection together</font>

552
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:12,050
thus you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> unbeatable sorry but um</font>

553
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:15,260
it's kind of like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARP attack on a</font>

554
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,970
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 platform with v6 it basically</font>

555
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,760
results in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> endless series of ICMP</font>

556
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,440
unreachable messages so networks it just

557
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,680
flooded with garbage data there has been

558
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">an RFC that's been proposed to</font>

559
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,000
depreciate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router heading of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font>

560
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,170
hopefully that will go through soon

561
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,440
because this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest known</font>

562
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,880
ipv6 exploits at this time so you have

563
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,950
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues with your security</font>

564
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,380
information and event management systems

565
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,180
no there's no current security

566
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,880
information event management system that

567
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,600
fully supports IP version 6 yet so

568
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,280
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to ID</font>

569
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,110
multiple addresses by the same host

570
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,210
because everybody that has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> link local</font>

571
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:57,709
address will also have a global IP

572
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,580
version 6 address there's there's no

573
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,780
efficient way to track that yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

574
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,860
sometimes they're running dual stack and

the running<font color="#E5E5E5"> both brother calls at the</font>

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:09,010
same time yep

577
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,270
so talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the issues with grep</font>

578
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,190
and you're logging servers there's

579
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,480
different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> display IP version 6</font>

580
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,910
addresses we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

581
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,500
truncating the addresses earlier so you

582
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,000
have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> first method where you don't</font>

583
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop the leading zeros and you have your</font>

584
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
second method where you forget to use a

585
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,310
double colon or you just have the actual

586
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,010
RFC 5952 standard you're logging systems

587
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,899
all may use different logging methods so

588
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,240
you have multiple different IP version 6

589
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,410
addresses throughout your different

590
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,940
logging systems there needs to be a

591
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,570
standard basically is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down</font>

592
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,620
to if you don't have a standard then

593
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,750
you're just going to be like well I'm

594
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to grip this style address well</font>

595
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,250
half your logging systems might have it

596
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,630
the other two-thirds might have well<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> us may not use RFC 5952 anywhere</font>

599
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,260
so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand the</font>

600
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,840
standards and try to reconfigure your

the host of the content well you know

630
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,820
reputation based production nobody has

631
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,860
established an ipv6 reputation database

632
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,960
so no one's using a reputation based

633
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,129
security database with ipv6 address and

634
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,070
therefore no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is building a</font>

635
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:16,350
reputation database it's looping logic

636
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,809
you're basically screwed until somebody

637
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,908
takes action and even once they do build

638
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you have such a large range of</font>

639
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,600
addresses from Aaron you just start

640
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,159
spamming off the new address<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

641
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,049
move down your block to another area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

642
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,970
you it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be difficult to block the whole</font>

643
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:32,250
subnet because then you're blocking a

644
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,990
huge chunk<font color="#CCCCCC"> of address space which if</font>

645
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,399
it's a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider that could be</font>

646
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:39,419
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousands millions of</font>

647
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:41,729
customers so how you manage a blacklist

648
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:43,350
will also change dramatically so that

649
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,360
and that talk ties right into the next

650
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:47,668
point effective rate limiting is almost

651
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,279
impossible in IP version 6 due to the

652
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,690
sheer size of the spec it's just

653
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:54,750
impractical especially since most

654
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:58,049
current standards deal out / 64 subnets

655
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:02,490
to edge routers so for some perspective

656
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:04,289
anyway a slash 96<font color="#CCCCCC"> an IP version 6 is</font>

657
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,899
roughly equivalent to the entire IP

658
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:09,600
version 4 internet there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are four</font>

659
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:13,739
billion 294 million nine hundred sixty

660
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:18,178
seven thousand two hundred 96 /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 sixes</font>

661
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:21,269
in a single / 64 so that many IP version

662
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:22,110
4 internets exists in 1 / 64 which is

663
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:23,789
what we're handing out to customers

664
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,709
saying here have all this address space

665
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:27,120
so the customer can just be like

666
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,860
well I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an attack on this</font>

667
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,658
site<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that IP got blocked let me just</font>

668
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,860
switch to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the other millions and</font>

669
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,909
millions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> millions of addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

670
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:40,320
have and just slide right through it so

671
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:42,539
what would we do what will we do build

672
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,918
solid transition plans I mean that the

673
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:45,870
same can be said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just networking</font>

674
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,000
101 right you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

675
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,439

676
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,240
network elements it's going to impact

677
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,830
and implement one thing at a time so I

678
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,890
mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on y'all's got understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

679
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,299
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be running dual stack</font>

680
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,190
probably another decade so even if you

685
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,529
at the end of day you're still going to

686
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">be running a dual stack you're going to</font>

687
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:14,279
be running both address spaces so you

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,260
have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to manage that migration</font>

689
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:19,380
of Wendy you eventually finally drop the

690

v4 space and that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be like</font>

on and so forth the syntax<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was an</font>

717
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,809
interesting actually thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

718
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,610
go over the syntax is it's pretty

719
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,250
similar type your version<font color="#E5E5E5"> for right it's</font>

720
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:29,428
just hexadecimal so at the base of it

721
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,070
all it's pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

722
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:34,620
got letters in your numbers

723
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,240
but knowing the syntax makes it much

724
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,800
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly deal with the security</font>

countermeasures since it's already been

727
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,150
around for more than a decade there's no

728
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,970
shortage on information on IP version 6

729
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,440
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderful 188 page guide from</font>

Technology ok the US government if you

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,320
want some light reading so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep</font>

735
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,950
moving forward check the data

736
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,510
documentation if it's pretty old there

737
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,430
may be rfcs that have been updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

738
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,900
upgraded since then you don't want to
