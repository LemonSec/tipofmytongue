19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,328
we set up a fictitious corporation and

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,000
we break the hell out of network systems

21
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,180
and give them two teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> that compete for</font>

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,910
three days we've been going since 2005

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,980
believe oh yeah by the way here are my

24

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,489
every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the word cyber drink</font>

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,380
and now you're what three behind so take

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:15,210
a shot no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but why the is nobody</font>

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:17,610
drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so competition started in</font>

31
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,089
2005<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a pilot program we became</font>

32
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,990
involved 2005-2006 and it was a rotating

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:27,000
situation we discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a hell</font>

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,140
of an effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with physical</font>

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,909
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and setting all this up</font>

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,100
and getting other colleges throughout

37
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,509
the region to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us was not</font>

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,789
possible so when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a 2009 i want to</font>

39
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,670
say we started hosting this thing full

40
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,750
time at Kennesaw State University so we

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,670
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this during spring break</font>

42
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,649
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically wire an entire</font>

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,079
building with a three separate

44
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,509
competition networks and set up set up

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,820
rooms for seven or eight competition

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,229
teams who have to come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first</font>

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,570
time this year we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had to do a</font>

48
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,460
qualifier because we have too many teams

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,309
that we could more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could take</font>

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,079
care of physically with hardware so as I

51
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,939
mentioned we<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're required to</font>

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,000
maintain critical services each year

53
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,640
it's some type of smtp<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS a couple of</font>

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,960
web servers database server so forth

55
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,579
so on and they're required to keep those

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,140
up while being tasked with the mundane

57
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,569
 that we have to do every day add

58
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,399
this employee take this employee out add

59
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,769
this new piece of hardware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CIO</font>

60
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,170
heard about on a radio talk show on the

61
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,810
way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the office evaluate this piece</font>

62
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,299
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software meanwhile they're being hit</font>

63
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,150
by red team members and and they have to

64
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,220
keep the services up against all that so

65
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,410
yeah like we said we've been hosting

66
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,800
this since we became<font color="#E5E5E5"> the permanent home</font>

67
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,230
in 2009 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hope to stay the the home</font>

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,000
for four years to come go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go</font>

69
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:50,170
if you're if you're waiting 30 seconds

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,640
of slide to just pick it up go go go so

71
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,200
like I said we are judged on three

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,630
criteria red and speed it up that's fine

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,339
we measure service up time with a with a

74
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,980
scoring engine we also judge them

75
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,040
against how they respond to injects and

76
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,738
we do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things drink we do</font>

77
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,799
all kinds of things with with with these

78
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:14,610
injects and and when we meet<font color="#CCCCCC"> precede</font>

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,380
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems with with malware</font>

80
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,390
inappropriate content and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect them</font>

81
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,100
to report<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all to us it's the same</font>

82
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,859
stuff that you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and deal with</font>

83
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,780
every day we put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three day</font>

84
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,269
