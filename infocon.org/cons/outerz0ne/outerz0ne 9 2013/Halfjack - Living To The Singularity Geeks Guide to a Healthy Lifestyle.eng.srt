00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,469
chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight barehanded against a</font>

141
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,849
brawny member of the weasel family who's

142
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,150
to say that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> share that flawed</font>

143
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:55,150
DNA I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a bathroom and find out</font>

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,638
but seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if I disregard the</font>

145
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:08,770
Uncle Carl factor at best I have 60

146
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:12,850
years left 60 only takes me to hear I

147
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,370
need to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear what's there the</font>

148
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,380
earliest estimate of the singularity

149
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,570
when man will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer his</font>

150
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:23,469
consciousness into machines and achieve

151
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,030
immortality so you're upset about

152
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:30,720
missing out on becoming some sort of

153
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:30,719
freakish self-aware robot by this much

154
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,979
so the singularity was proposed by Ray

155
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,180
Kurzweil while back he's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I many</font>

156
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,310
people probably know his name he's done

157
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,949
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology was very very much</font>

158
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,360
in the early days he struggles to do

159
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,750
that he takes about two hundred

160
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,990
supplement pills a day tries to<font color="#CCCCCC"> live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

161
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,419
you know this nice stuff so but I'm not

162
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,240
sure that's a good good path is you'll

little sucker<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but actually that's</font>

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,760
not too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much true most of the diseases</font>

169
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,830
that we associate with old age are from

170
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,710
a lifetime of not doing the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

171
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,448
rather than a lifetime<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being alive</font>

172
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if we you know if we sort of</font>

173
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,330
take care of our bodies work with them

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the way that they're built to work</font>

and you know rap you know chase down

00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:49,990
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is possible but lifestyle choices</font>

184
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,670
have a huge impact on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

185
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:56,350
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem evolutionarily</font>

186
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:59,260
speaking we are screwed<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we don't</font>

187
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,830
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our bodies</font>

188

evolved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

189
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,470
for the last couple hundred thousand

190
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,010
years up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple hundred years ago</font>

191
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:15,760
we lived in small mostly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know clean</font>

192
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,110
type of groups we were struggling<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

193
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,880
find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat so we were very</font>

194
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:24,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">very active stress was a cute you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

195
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,330
I'm worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know this</font>

196
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,240
large beast i'm going to kill and eat

197
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,640
might kill and eat me first so very very

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,680
direct stress largely under our control

199
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay we ate anything that came along</font>

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:43,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">groves leaves berries roots tubers nuts</font>

201
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,980
animals you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could</font>

202
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,250
sort of you know get a hold up and

203
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,530
wouldn't get us first and we had very

204
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">little access to concentrate the sugars</font>

205
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,860
except for fruit which has a little

206
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber which really really helps balance</font>

207
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,590
it out and the fat we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much</font>

208
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was you know from animals and you know</font>

209
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:06,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">we were eating the meat and the all that</font>

210
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort stuff so today we live largely</font>

211
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,890
individualistic lives we have limited

212
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,690
social interaction except now by

213
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,870
technology which we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

214
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,670
the same we were plagued by not<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress</font>

215
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,480
we can do stuff about but intellectual

216
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,310
stress<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the boss is on our case and</font>

217
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,700
we can't either kill him or run away

218
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:31,630
from it so we just what I sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font>

219
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:34,480
stew a while yeah yeah so we make a

220
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">living and we find our entertainment by</font>

221
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,150
sitting in front of a screen you know we

222
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,280
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside under our fish lights way we</font>

223
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,000
are today we consume highly processed

224
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,329
food that's salty fatty has lots of

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,830
sugar in it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes lots of</font>

226
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:53,650
money for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies that sell those</font>

227
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:57,520
foods and we watch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff down with</font>

228
00:10:53,650 --> 00:11:00,459
a caffeinated sugary drinks so yeah I

229
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,110
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just wonder</font>

230
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,330
granddaughter this is the modern life<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

231
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,030
would say it's maybe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimate</font>

232
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,400
achievement of the geek life you know is

233
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,620
that that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so</font>

234
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,540
likes it evolutionarily we're screwed

235
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built to live the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

236
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,160
that we're mostly living that dream but

237
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:20,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a we can make smallish now say</font>

238
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,150
smallish because some of these do

239
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,060
require a fairly significant sort of

240
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:28,730
change in how we do stuff but if we do

241
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,869
that we greatly improve our health and

242
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:37,310
our longevity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

243
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:39,380
so what we need to do is rtfm the manual

244
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,979
for our bodies that is think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

245
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:45,020
evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> built us to work and then try</font>

246
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,780
to do stuff that sort of lines up with

247
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:51,140
our operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters that involves</font>

248
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:57,350
several<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas activity diet sleep stress</font>

249
00:11:51,140 --> 00:12:00,590
social interactions string yeah this as

250
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,250
you may recognize is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cell introduced</font>

251
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:08,150
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grade third</font>

252
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,230
grade biology class ring the college

253
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:14,990
okay all right that is a load of crap

254
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,630
okay that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seem like that our</font>

255
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">cells are small little discrete</font>

256
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:23,780
component elements you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

257
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,069
know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idealized description of</font>

258
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,329
network traffic or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font>

259
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:32,300
okay and it's not they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are incredibly</font>

260
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:35,060
credibly complicated sharpened over for

261
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,479
billions evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> micro machines right</font>

262
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,449
so think more about looking at the

263
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,300
picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know a cpu die rather</font>

264
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,250
than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know thinking about cpu and</font>

265
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,870
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveling in and out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it the</font>

266
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,990
graphics<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you see in your computer</font>

267
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,120
classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we would like to</font>

268
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,340
really really really complex systems

269
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,980
highly interactive highly they have got

270
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,930
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of self feedback loops and stuff</font>

271
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,910
in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thinking about it is</font>

272
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,650
you know okay I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the mitochondria</font>

273
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,219
over here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got the necklace over</font>

274
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,230
there just doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you know come</font>

275
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,680
close to what's really going on there

276
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,540
right so I liking this sort of the

277
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,880
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a web page</font>

278
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,800
it's got a form you type in stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

279
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,439
well that's a pretty simple

280
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,849
representation of output on that but

281
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,770
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know many people in here</font>

282
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,400
a programmer know enough think about the

283
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:30,590
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes behind that okay it's not</font>

284
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,329
simple as complex it has to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a</font>

285
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,160
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places where something can muck</font>

286
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,000
up the work you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font>

287
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,770
against you know server side or SQL

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,600
insertion attacks stuff like that so

289
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:46,100
yeah really really complex stuff and you

290
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,070
think my gosh how can I ever understand

291
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,680
that and deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yeah it's not that</font>

292
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,020
hard because just as we have to just you

293
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,390
know plug in our name<font color="#CCCCCC"> and credit card</font>

294
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,460
number to the website and you know we

295
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,680
get our stuff ship from amazon no

296
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,010
problems there the operation can be

297
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,900
fairly simple as long as we sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

298
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,900
sure to put the right stuff in the forms

299
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,610
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do we figure out</font>

300
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:22,340
what it is we need to do how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

301
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:25,040
how to live hmm well one way to do or

302
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:29,150
one way to not do it is listen to stuff

303
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,589
you hear in the news hmm so three types

304
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:35,439
of lies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people make new this</font>

305
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:37,940
quote lies<font color="#E5E5E5"> damn lies and statistics</font>

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
family attributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark Twain he actually</font>

307
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,750
attributed it to dizzer<font color="#CCCCCC"> ailey although</font>

308
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,120
there's no evidence written evidence

309
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,160
that does Railly ever said it but it was

310
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,820
sort of us phrase going around and and

311
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,850
he took<font color="#CCCCCC"> possession of it so what we have</font>

312
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,430
is that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of scientific research</font>

313
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,070
is being done on metabolism body health

314
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,800
office kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and they all get</font>

315
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,900
reported and they're almost always

316
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,510
reported shallow<font color="#CCCCCC"> II and probably</font>

317
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,449
incorrect<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so they tell us the</font>

318
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,900
big numbers but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell us you</font>

319
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,830
know what's all the subtleties of

320
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,939
qualifications when this happens all

321
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:20,999
that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so january third this</font>

322
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,939
year may recognize some of these

323
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:28,600
overweight people live longer a little

324
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:35,339
extra fat may help you Oh way people

325
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:35,339
have lower dance routines<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah</font>

326
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:45,040
yes oh so like said this was actually a

327
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,379
meta-analysis study which means they

328
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,179
took like 216 studies of people that

329
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,490
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> went out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and did work measured</font>

330
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:54,040
body fat and track<font color="#E5E5E5"> people for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

331
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:58,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all this kind of stuff and it was</font>

332
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">severely flawed plus it didn't reach the</font>

333
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:05,229
conclusion that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news reported this</font>

334
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:07,779
to hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> man okay so they didn't fail</font>

335
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,389
distinguish between smokers severely ill

336
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:13,259
cancer patients people who were well

337
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:16,029
smokers traditionally are slightly

338
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:19,089
lighter or slightly have lower body

339
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:21,519
weight than non-smokers people like

340
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,679
cancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and AIDS patients who are not you</font>

341
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they're not dying because they're</font>

342
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,050
thin<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're thin because they're dying</font>

343
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,319
which sort of counteracts that then is

344
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:34,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">good you know that thing is bad for you</font>

345
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:37,449
extremely elderly folks which as you say

346
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:39,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know people sudden until I tend tend</font>

347
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,378
to waste away is they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into extreme</font>

348
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:45,550
age and so they're thin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

349
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:47,230
die and then the regular folks you know

350
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no distinction between these</font>

351
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:54,459
categories and so the fact that you know

352
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,620
thin people who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> AIDS die doesn't</font>

353
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:58,239
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact the saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regular</font>

354
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,699
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal healthy person walking</font>

355
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,309
around are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they better off thinner or</font>

356
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:06,339
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten extra pounds over or 40 extra</font>

357
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:07,990
pounds or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's kind</font>

358
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,869
of thing we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't really trust</font>

359
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,329
those statistics in any way okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

360
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:16,148
of this mix of data if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

361
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers it pushed up mortality a</font>

362
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:19,958
little bit compared to people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

363
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:22,390
slightly overweight and regular weight

364
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,760
but you know the way the numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

365
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,370
just a little bit past overweight into

366
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,610
the obese category the number

367
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:32,070
you know mortality shot way up vegan so

368
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:36,300
bad data bad study and this is typical

369
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:39,720
of news reports train suck<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my us</font>

370
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,870
against the media the women start

371
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,760
looking at you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live good</font>

372
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and healthy one of the things we have to</font>

373
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,160
be careful of<font color="#E5E5E5"> is inflammation and I said</font>

374
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:54,510
this is sort of a recalls of a lot of

375
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:57,360
our problems ok so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that complexity</font>

376
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,720
the inflammation cascade is a complex

377
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,840
series of biochemical operations that

378
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,220
when we damaged tissue we are stung by

379
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,340
bee we're cut we over exert a muscle and

380
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,200
you know tear some of the muscle<font color="#CCCCCC"> fibers</font>

381
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,050
all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff get infection all of</font>

382
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,420
this stuff causes chemical<font color="#CCCCCC"> reactions in</font>

383
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the body that marshal the body's</font>

384
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,420
defenses to come in and you know attack

385
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,710
the bacteria later rebuild our muscle

386
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:35,600
repair you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cut or something like</font>

387
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:39,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but um chronic</font>

388
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,459
inflammation is very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad okay and</font>

389
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,250
we get chronic information<font color="#E5E5E5"> inflammation</font>

390
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,890
from a lot of sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but when we do</font>

391
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:53,280
have it all the immune disease like

392
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:55,650
asthma arthritis diabetes especially

393
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,629
heart disease<font color="#E5E5E5"> clogging and arteries</font>

394
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,010
inflammation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the arteries which is</font>

395
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,300
caused by everything from high blood

396
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:05,940
pressure too high glucose levels to

397
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,889
chemicals that we is the main killer of

398
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,210
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there okay most people die</font>

399
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:15,179
of heart attacks right so having clear

400
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:18,740
arteries is you know what we won't and

401
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:21,510
inflammation make some clogged-up things

402
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:25,470
can't say for sure there's some evidence

403
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:28,460
that cancer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of link to that</font>

404
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,480
although information also likes it

405
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,100
depresses the immune system and immune

406
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,179
system is key and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cancer so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

407
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,679
hard to work it out like say it's

408
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,210
complex

409
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,700
so what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information is</font>

410
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,950
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of sources and stress</font>

411
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,390
is one of our sources and again to

412
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,270
understand the complexities we sort of

413
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,060
need to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens when we get</font>

414
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,580
stressed thing so everybody's heard of

415
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,220
the fight-or-flight reflex you know

416
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,770
Sheldon said yep it's you know how much

417
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">of one we got is genetically coded also</font>

418
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually tied a lot to environment that</font>

419
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:09,210
is certain types of environmental

420
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,160
factors when we're young greatly

421
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:14,190
influenced our response to fight or

422
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,520
flight situations and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

423
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,710
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had bad childhoods are sort</font>

424
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,480
of on a hair trigger as far as this and

425
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,810
that leads to lots of problems you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

426
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,250
drug abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> mental illness poor</font>

427
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,669
relationships lots of things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

428
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,190
thing but you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a tiger</font>

429
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,340
jumping out of the bushes at you you

430
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:38,040
need some adrenaline to kick in and you

431
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,750
know make blood pull to the center so

432
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,070
that we can distribute oxygen from our

433
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:46,290
lungs and get powered up run like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell</font>

434
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">or grab a stick and beat it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

435
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:52,020
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so sharpens our senses</font>

436
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sorta gets our minds as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

437
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:58,740
our bodies in a hyper state so that's

438
00:20:54,930 --> 00:21:01,590
good it can save your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life however that</font>

439
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:05,940
chronic stress you know boss problems

440
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:08,850
traffic problems you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting you</font>

441
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,870
know and I the DMV all of these you know

442
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:15,000
first world problem types of issues they

443
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,830
do the same thing they cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> the release</font>

444
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,650
of some chemicals from the adrenal gland

445
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,820
that are you know getting a set to fight

446
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,010
something but there's nothing there that

447
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,610
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can fight or there's nothing there to</font>

448
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:28,850
fight you know at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so this cortisol</font>

449
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,770
chemical which is you know shown there

450
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:34,740
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the one this is the</font>

451
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,510
stress hormone and having it running

452
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,470
around in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our blood system all the time</font>

453
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:42,210
is really really bad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us okay and it</font>

454
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,440
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like said that hyper when</font>

455
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:49,039
we're in hyperdrive we ignore regular

456
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,789
maintenance so we're you know our

457
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,620
glucose fat metabolism is messed up

458
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:56,330
calcium is pulled out for for use and

459
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,508
you're on neural transmissions rather

460
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,759
than put into our bones we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

461
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:08,480
thinking about sex while we're trying to

462
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:10,789
survive so decreases libido right so

463
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,100
especially in women I'll put it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

464
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,769
so this is typically why the higher

465
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,360
education and woman has the<font color="#E5E5E5"> load the</font>

466
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:20,269
less times a week she had<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex because</font>

467
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,809
she has a stressful job and you know

468
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:26,240
that decreases our vehicles having this

469
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,009
floating around in our body leads to

470
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,919
inflammation especially the arteries

471
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and of course you know leads to</font>

472
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,340
mental health<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got a billion-dollar</font>

473
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,529
industry of anti depressants and mood

474
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,889
enhancers and xanax and all that kind of

475
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:42,409
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but what are we going to do</font>

476
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:44,539
about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems well let's</font>

477
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:46,460
start thinking with diet first okay

478
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,200
which of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

479
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:56,450
probably the healthiest thing to put in

480
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:59,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">your mouth black coffee right bacon is</font>

481
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:03,610
number two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would put okay orange juice</font>

482
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:06,919
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not do that oranges</font>

483
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:09,439
fantastic for you orange juice<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

484
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:11,210
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks a high sugar drink it's like</font>

485
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,210
drinking a coke just about Scott dynavin

486
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,279
say sure and not enough really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort</font>

487
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of counterbalance that Sugarbush they</font>

488
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:20,480
get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and of course wheat bread</font>

489
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,000
well if it's wheat bread that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you made</font>

490
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,850
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole wheat it would be probably up</font>

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,679
there number two is right however go

492
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,949
ahead wheat bread that you buy in the

493
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,720
store is brown white bread Jane which

494
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:36,980
leads into a couple of points that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

495
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,250
be seeing later on so chicken alfredo of

496
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,889
course you know the fat and the pasta

497
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:47,389

501
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:58,830
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said the black coffee is is packed</font>

502
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,290
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> photochemical called flavonoids</font>

503
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,280
there's a whole class of these we give

504
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">them lots of places berries beans nuts</font>

vegetables dark<font color="#CCCCCC"> chocolate is a great</font>

506
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,870
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flavonoids so you know i would</font>

507
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:15,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that basically if you had coffee</font>

treating symptoms and leaving the cost

523
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,270
the cause there to continue profits into

524
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,919
the next 40 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what what</font>

name's pollen and he's written several

530
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,130
books he wrote an excellent book about

531
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,370
plants that we have changed and have

532
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed us including what Apple Apple's</font>

marijuana and potatoes was as I couldn't

534
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,610
couldn't answer but but those you know

535
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,160
three plants that really had a huge

536
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,469
impact on them and other books about

537
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:40,500
food the you know the chain food chain

538
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:43,820
stuff later so his advice it's

539
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,820
surprisingly left to eat food

540
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:51,059
yeah but so much I didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font>

541
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:52,649
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't find it actually there's a</font>

542
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:56,070
great get fuzzy cartoon about how

543
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:58,139
satchel the dog is describing that you

544
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,210
know while sixty-two percent of the

545
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:02,969
stuff in the apartment is edible only

546
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,289
eighteen percent is food<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

547
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like the remote control in the</font>

548
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:09,450
carpet we're in his list and that's

549
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,460
that's a situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find ourselves in</font>

550
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,429
is much of the stuff we eat is not

551
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:17,369
really food if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a you know more</font>

552
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:19,979
came from a factory than a farm is

553
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:24,149
probably not you know deserving to be

554
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:29,369
classified<font color="#CCCCCC"> as food Twinkies you know</font>

555
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:31,738
process bread frozen meals all that kind

556
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:34,889
of stuff if it's been processed it's

557
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:37,259
it's lost most of its food pneus<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

558
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:41,070
now the reason it's in the grocery store

559
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:43,859
is really really really profitably okay

560
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:47,009
you know you take a bag of corn out of

561
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,869
the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> frozen food section and you</font>

562
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:52,710
know it's what 99-cent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say well</font>

563
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:55,709
half of that corn goes into the 395 bag

564
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:58,080
of corn chips at your Bible so they're

565
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,789
making lots of money by processing and

566
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,949
then selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> processing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a higher</font>

567
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:04,769
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what we get new is trying</font>

568
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:09,239
to eat flex it avoid stuff this process

569
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:11,239
so vegetables meat beans all these kind

570
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:13,769
of things that basically are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

571
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:17,070
they came came off the tree out of the

572
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:18,330
ground whatever that stuff this hasn't

573
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,399
been messed with hasn't had the good

574
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,619
stuff taken out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it in a tenth of what</font>

575
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,258
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> took out put back in so they could</font>

576
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:28,178
label it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fortified that's the kind</font>

577
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:31,160
of stuff we won't need a few

578
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:33,110
per unit price comparison between an

579
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,330
ounce of potato chips and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ounce of</font>

580
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:38,090
potato mm-hmm I forget what it was that

581
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone 40 yeah yeah and that is</font>

582
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,080
staggering and I said the potato is not

583
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,590
that bad for you in the potato chip is

584
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,820
not that good for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the</font>

585
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:51,500
tater chip is a lot tastier so yeah so

586
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,129
see that's the things we've gotta sort

587
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,660
of we<font color="#E5E5E5"> firstly need to sort of tone down</font>

588
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:58,760
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> taste but sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get them used to</font>

589
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:02,600
more natural flavors rather than this

590
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:07,010
just bang of salt<font color="#E5E5E5"> foil and you know the</font>

591
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:09,110
starches so well I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doritos oh you</font>

592
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,570
know I got a six-pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's covered</font>

593
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,889
by bag of Doritos so you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

594
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:18,740
do any good to impress women with so not

595
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,720
too much which of course is if we're

596
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,820
going to we you know need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut down on</font>

597
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">calories probably and mostly plants</font>

598
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:29,178
because those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that we</font>

599
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:31,120
mentioned flavonoids<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the chemical</font>

600
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:32,780
chemicals that are anti-inflammatory

601
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,289
antioxidants and all these categories

602
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,059
all of those sort of things we find in

603
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:41,870
high concentrations and all types of

604
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:43,129
plants ok so now based upon this and

605
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,949
other information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

606
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,870
prices I think sky dog hates us and is

607
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,500
trying to kill us because if you open up

608
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,239
your bag this are possibly the pinion is

609
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,880
probably the healthiest thing in there

610
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,720
as far as avoiding the stuff that we're

611
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to avoid</font>

612
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:09,910
hmm I've got I've got one of the matrix

613
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:12,340
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot there you yes sir that's it</font>

614
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,070
all right let's get minerals in it so

615
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:17,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> riddled smells good so if you</font>

616
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,820
note the stuff that we're talking about

617
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,510
the Michael Pollan other people talking

618
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:26,110
about is the pre-industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> diet that is</font>

619
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:29,110
before we developed machinery that would

620
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:31,209
grind grain and throw away<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to</font>

621
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,590
throw away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from grain the throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away the</font>

622
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,900
parts that are good because they have

623
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:38,020
all in that spoil so it's all part of an

624
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,660
industrial<font color="#CCCCCC"> process that makes you know a</font>

625
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:45,270
product that is easily shipped and sold

626
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:47,680
and you know distributed but not healthy

627
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:49,360
so the same that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like it's like</font>

628
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,950
the tomato everybody knows you know the

629
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,229
tomatoes basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> their pick green</font>

630
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,780
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Laria their hardest you</font>

631
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,790
know softballs and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> punk get a</font>

632
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,410
ethylene gas on them to try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

633
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:00,610
ready so that they can sell them in the

634
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,960
grocery store you cut them off they're

635
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,780
still green in the middle there

636
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,730
tasteless because shipping you know

637
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">times and needs and distance and putting</font>

638
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,450
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in packing the trucks and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

639
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,910
like that they need a hard tomato they

640
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,010
don't need to taste you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomato so this</font>

641
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,230
happens with everything with you know

642
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,180
grains let's take all the stuff that's

643
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,890
good on the grain<font color="#CCCCCC"> drying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up in the</font>

644
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,320
flour<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put this in things and</font>

645
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,320
sell stuff you general<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian</font>

646
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,140
yeah the food travels most of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

647
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,060
thousand miles and it's often you know

648
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,940
what goes through a factory on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

649
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,679
where they take out the good stuff and

650
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know there's local food</font>

651
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,520
movement slow food movement saw this

652
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,860
kinda stuff and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core of many</font>

653
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,840
of those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of food movements is you</font>

654
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,360
know let's get some food that was grown

655
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,480
locally didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a huge impact on the</font>

656
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:02,350
environment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tastes good and is a</font>

657
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:05,030
lot healthier so all right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

658
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,860
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our ancestors we do not</font>

659
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:09,830
have to worry about starving to death

660
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,530
right our problem is the opposite thing

661
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,939
so whenever we need to eat we need to

662
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,760
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about oh I don't need to fuel up</font>

663
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go sit down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> codeine</font>

664
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,860
right we need to think everything about

665
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,209
nutrition that's right they said our

666
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,770
brain<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a tremendous glucose user but</font>

667
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,710
we slice it we could probably eat half

668
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:34,790
of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> eat and still have plenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

669
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:37,370
fuel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but nutrition is a different</font>

670
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,409
story okay most of the food like said

671
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,959
and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things are going to</font>

672
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:46,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">be well what I go out to buy my food</font>

673
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,560
from you know McDonald's or wherever

674
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,389
this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the food that you say</font>

675
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,760
we need matches the stuff that's on

676
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">there meaning which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again relates back</font>

677
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,460
to the industrial processes the ease of

678
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,800
you know building and selling stuff but

679
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:05,360
we need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things far as you know II</font>

680
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:07,760
for nutrition and here's here's the bad

681
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,909
thing process carbs are pretty much the

682
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,690
villain in most health related issues in

683
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:16,940
America including heart disease diabetes

684
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,540
obesity all those kind of stuff why I

685
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:22,520
process cards are they evil you know

686
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,170
well as you may have heard you know if

687
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,170
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a five hour</font>

688
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:29,750
energy drink commercial the sugar crash

689
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,310
well the sugar crash happens because

690
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,280
when we eat something that's already

691
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:35,240
been pre-chewed and had the fiber taken

692
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,820
out over to the fact

693
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,710
it hits our stomach and pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

694
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,139
straight into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloodstream chain</font>

695
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,850
which is great if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

696
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,140
jumping on the road and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

697
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:50,030
marathon<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but not so great again if</font>

698
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,800
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pop our butts in a chair</font>

699
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:56,450
and type on the computer or play video

700
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:58,280
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is that when we get</font>

701
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,980
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much sugar in our blood it's very</font>

702
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,309
damaging so the effects of diabetes are

703
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,020
awful right the excess sugar molecules

704
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:07,879
in our blood plug up little capillaries

705
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:11,330
in our eyes and our fingers<font color="#E5E5E5"> leads to</font>

706
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">amputation blindness damaged organs all</font>

707
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,290
kinds of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in order to</font>

708
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,970
prevent that our body throws out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font>

709
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">insulin so we get a big sugar low we get</font>

710
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,160
a big inch of insulin Russia ok so the

711
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:24,170
crash comes in is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big load of</font>

712
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,480
insulin far more than our bodies are

713
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,010
really designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

714
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,429
didn't grow up in an environment where

715
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:34,970
sugar was was plentiful is it sucks out

716
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:37,100
too much it over corrects and now we

717
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,260
have low blood glucose we feel drained

718
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,290
we're hungry because when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have low</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glucose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

720
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:47,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the sugar is stripped out and put</font>

721
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,250
in fat when stored in fat for later use

722
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,900
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd never need to get views</font>

723
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,340
later because we keep dumping some more

724
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,320
sugar over if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to many times</font>

725
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,000
you get insulin insensitivity which

726
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically means your body says oh that</font>

727
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,610
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to respond and this</font>

728
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,940
is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with all type 2 or adult</font>

729
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:11,899
onset diabetes which has exploded in the

730
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:14,270
last 40 years right it's just didn't go

731
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:17,779
check the rates but it is tremendous and

732
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:20,330
if you you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat the typical</font>

733
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:24,010
American diet and you live longer you're

734
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:28,509
going to get diabetes so

735
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:31,250
in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our insulin cortisol is</font>

736
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:34,250
released as far that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know action</font>

737
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:37,690
response and that least inflammation and

738
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:41,119
all the bad stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it does so</font>

739
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:43,760
avoiding that sugar high<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then crash</font>

740
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:47,480
is really the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoiding disease</font>

741
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,760
and losing what I said those two things

742
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:54,199
just go hand in hand if we can avoid

743
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugar bump and drop okay now one of</font>

744
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:58,189
the big things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it is fiber if you</font>

745
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,890
don't have a recommendation but if you

746
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,680
add fiber to a meal that has a lot of

747
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:05,420
sugar in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it slows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down resource and a</font>

748
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,810
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times you get both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in same thing</font>

749
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,940
you eat fruit eat vegetables the fruit

750
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:15,380
comes with the fibers<font color="#E5E5E5"> come with both</font>

751
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:17,960
sugars and fiber and so they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

752
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:22,670
work together and you get a long release

753
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:27,260
of glucose so now in addition the carbs

754
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,490
okay that is the other meal or other you

755
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,440
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> substance you may have learned</font>

756
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,649
about in your college nutrition class

757
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:37,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Americans have been</font>

758
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,320
taught that fat is bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and there is</font>

759
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:42,980
very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> little evidence that actually</font>

760
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,839
directly ties dietary fat to heart

761
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,359
disease which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the theory has</font>

762
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:50,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">been for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last 40 years okay now</font>

763
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,369
trans fats which thankfully because of

764
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,980
the big fuss about them have pretty much

765
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,240
gone away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> most things a lot of</font>

766
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,480
stuff used to have trans fats and trans

767
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,220
fats we're horrible for you but most

768
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,130
places have actually taken some you know

769
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,529
either quietly or loudly taking trans

770
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,150
fats out of their products so they're

771
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,410
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as big a thing you want to watch for</font>

772
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,420
them but you're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

773
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,170
see them in too many places ok so our

774
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:17,570
cell membranes our neurons all of the

775
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:20,540
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our bodies have fat in them and</font>

776
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:24,530
we need fat to build those components so

777
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:26,550
we need fat now the kind that we get in

778
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,880
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little careful about</font>

779
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,590
so protein you know carbohydrates

780
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:37,290
poaching fat those who think they're

781
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:39,510
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the protein is just another fuel</font>

782
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:44,400
source unless we happen to need it to

783
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:46,260
add muscle<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

784
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,300
know working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out really trying to you</font>

785
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,940
know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get toned get fit bulk up</font>

786
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:54,050
you might want to increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> your protein</font>

787
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,400
and whey protein<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know from</font>

788
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">leftover from cheese manufacturer is one</font>

789
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,350
of the better<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that I have sort of</font>

790
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,000
seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you know being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to be</font>

791
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,610
picked up and put in muscle mass iron

792
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,110
geek to maybe kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

793
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:09,000
contradict or contribute to that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

794
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">as what proteins are is good for</font>

795
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,830
building up muscle in recovery from

796
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:15,120
exercise extreme pain thing but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

797
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,920
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of that you don't need a lot of</font>

798
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,109
protein so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> Americans eat too</font>

799
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,130
much protein too much fat and not enough

800
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,810
complex carbs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what we're</font>

801
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,450
looking for in our diet a balance of

802
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:31,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">clamtxt cards good fats lean protein</font>

803
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:35,040
with fiber mixed in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good fats</font>

804
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,020
would include non saturated fats<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

806
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff like that but fat from nuts fat</font>

807
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:48,540
from other plant sources canola<font color="#E5E5E5"> olive</font>

808
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff like that those those oils useful</font>

809
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,790
for building cell membranes and neural

810
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,220
tissue making our actually getting your

811
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,770
brain and your skin is made of almost

812
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same stuff so if you improve the</font>

chemicals going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your brain you</font>

814
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,870
actually make your skin look younger and

815
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,680
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible too so it's sort of a</font>

816
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:09,420
double win question to me the only

817
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason I added this slide in as I found</font>

00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that picture and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I loved it so is</font>

819
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:21,090
me good or bad um well

820
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,299
some of it is is you know it's not going

821
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,330
to hurt you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay again probably don't</font>

822
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:31,500
want a ton of it should you eat meal at

823
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:34,350
every meal probably not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know</font>

824
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,740
good mix of edges<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want us good um when</font>

825
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,360
you do eat it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can skip the skinless</font>

826
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,549
chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> breast that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're eating</font>

827
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you think it's healthy that skin</font>

828
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:46,920
has got good good fats in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

829
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:50,400
need some fat<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all that tissue growth</font>

830
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,070
so you know fish protein really good is

831
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,470
very very lean lean beef and pork and

832
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,790
other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

833
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:59,700
partial to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know pasture-raised</font>

834
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,890
chicken because it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> that chicken that</font>

835
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,509
we can picked up a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

836
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:06,120
flavonoids photo chemicals and stuff

837
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,380
like that that is helpful for its<font color="#E5E5E5"> body</font>

838
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">building and then we're going to eat it</font>

839
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it collected all of those good things</font>

840
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,100
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us some unique likes it be sure to</font>

841
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:17,750
eat the skin you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that chicken</font>

842
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:21,390
because we do need that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat for gross</font>

843
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,990
right so here's the recommendations or

844
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:26,250
not ok we're looking for variety lots of

845
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,319
different types of foods you know

846
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,880
typical McDonalds meal you know it's got

847
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,130
like three things on it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

848
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the meat it's got the bun you don't</font>

849
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:39,390
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run and you know potato</font>

850
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:41,910
sit on so not much variety there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

851
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:45,870
we're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> color colorful</font>

852
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:47,970
vegetables are good<font color="#E5E5E5"> red to know I could</font>

853
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:51,299
stuff and generally we're looking for

854
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,709
unmess<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tyrone witness that is it hasn't</font>

855
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,140
been through a factory<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's processed</font>

856
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,420
the hell out of it and left us with

857
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,069
stuff that's easily transportable you

858
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,740
know but stand is very easily

859
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:05,160
transportable but not good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us right</font>

860
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,810
so if it's made with flour you probably

861
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,640
shouldn't pick it up I said if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

863
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:17,040
key thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw out processed grains</font>

864
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:20,040

the stuff that's been messed around with

876
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,790
you won't have to try to decipher these

877

probably should get that our sleep

of how we stay up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it's hard</font>

1008
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,830
because our bodies for some weird reason

have a 25-hour circadian rhythm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1027
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,980
really sort of wrecked our circadian

rhythms and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only things I said this</font>

1031
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,460

lighting it was just handy that it would

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,810
always be resetting itself to the thing

1035
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:53,640
it would never sort of get too short it

1036

would always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to reset itself back to</font>

1038
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:05,430
check you were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shirt says do not</font>

1039
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:07,740
expose the Sun line now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because of</font>

circadian rhythms which if you don't

1043

know skating rhythms are the natural

body cycles of arousal and depression as

1045
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,540
far as doing it and sleep is kind of

1046
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,509
interesting scientists still can't

1047
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,820
figure out why we sleep think maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1048
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,920
evolutionary to keep us in active at

00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,130
night when bigger bigger meaner things

function learning at kind of stuff but

1052
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,900
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get it getting on</font>

1053
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,120
a schedule for sleep is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

1054
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,830
for motor off stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know i</font>

00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:02,339
incredibly you know he and verify tied

1059
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:04,619
to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things so we are active we</font>

1060
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:06,930
have better mood stresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduced we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">meat the more you exercise generally the</font>

1063
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:16,440
better your mind works ok so the

1064
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,399
increase in libidos especially in women

1065
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,710
that's a more pronounced in ribbon on

1066
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,660
the body boost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the immune system gets</font>

00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood pumping kind of washes out all</font>

1068
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,799
of the stuff their chemical reaction on

1069
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:33,149
their weight control all that good stuff

1070
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:34,980
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the brain when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we exercise we</font>

1071
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,660
produce chemicals which are called nerve

protecting compounds including

1073
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:42,328
brain-derived neurotrophic factor which

1074
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:45,899
helps build neurons and maintain them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1075
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:48,930
in high school students exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

1079
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:58,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">exercise for a year and what so four</font>

1080
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,180
points on your IQ just by you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

1083
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:09,288
better blood flow to learn especially

00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:12,750
for later life<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe reducing</font>

1085

cardiovascular disease so slow in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1086
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,980
blood plugging up you know blood flow

1087
00:50:15,029 --> 00:50:21,029
going into the head and providing a

1088
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:23,089
things there so and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Earth's</font>

1089
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and things is exercise is produced</font>

1090
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:27,869
compressive stress to the body but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1091
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:30,450
repeated stress is like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after</font>

1092
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:32,220
repeated stress anybody sort of calms

1093
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:35,089
down didn't get too excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so</font>

1094
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:39,410
it reduces our cortisol response and

1095
00:50:35,089 --> 00:50:41,779
people who exercise are much less

1096
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:45,538
responsive to emotional distress than

1097
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:47,849
people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I've had many</font>

1098
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:49,319
doctors tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that exercise pretty</font>

1099
00:50:47,849 --> 00:50:51,690
much is the Fountain of Youth the more

1100
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:54,569
you move the younger you'll be longer in

1101
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,880
life and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> burning calories</font>

1102
00:50:54,569 --> 00:50:58,349
before and after sort amps up the immune

1103
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,759
system so now I do you work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know</font>

1104
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:01,570
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> my benefit while you're working out</font>

1105
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,490
but when you

1106
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:05,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sit down your body</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still burning a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit faster our body gets</font>

1108
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:10,330
strengthened the whole inflammation

1110
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:23,500
from this right and it has a huge impact

1111
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:26,350
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cholesterol so walking is fine if</font>

00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,440
you walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good you know Park it the</font>

walk into the store don't try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

1118
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,310
benefits yeah all should probably do

1119
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:44,020
intervals which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said would make you</font>

1120
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to run outrun the zombies if we</font>

1121
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:51,850
have zombie apocalypse because because

1122
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:52,720
it and we the interval training you can

1123
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:55,990
look it up on the internet basically

1124
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,879
it's a hard stress and then a slow pace

1125
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:59,709
hard stress<font color="#CCCCCC"> lefay stuff if you're</font>

1126
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,810
paddling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pedal like hell for two</font>

1127
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:04,480
minutes and then you likely pedal for

1128
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:06,130
three minutes held for two light for

1129
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,250
that and actually this burns a lot more

1130
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,350
calories if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> burn your do a medium</font>

00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,780
pace for the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of time so</font>

1132
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:15,819
intervals fact our body really really

1133
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,850
responds well to that stress of action

1134
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,200
and improve you know proves oxygen

1135
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:22,029
uptake endurance and all that kind of

1136
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,549
stuff so not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits from</font>

1137
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:27,180
doing arrows and strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> training</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1138
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:29,980
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be swatching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> negar but</font>

1139
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,589
doing the street trading is really

1140
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,350
important especially as you get older a

1141
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:39,010
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the effects of your losing</font>

00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:41,770
balance bone loss you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just you know</font>

1143
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,240
general lack of energy if you do

1144
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,800
strength training<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they go into</font>

1145
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,839
nursing homes they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people to</font>

1146
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,540
work out for you know three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months and</font>

1147
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:52,090
they see market improvements in their

1148
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,500
overall health so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easier the course</font>

1149
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,720
they're getting habit when you're young

1150
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,820
and you know don't hurt so much after

1151
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but</font>

1152
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,290
regular exercise a good bit intervals

1153
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:05,860
you know just sort of boost your whole

00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:08,860
metabolism and strength<font color="#E5E5E5"> training right</font>

1155
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:11,260
so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at diet and exercise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which of</font>

1156
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:14,980
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the big ones a few</font>

1157
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:17,950
recommendations whatever we're looking

1158
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know at eating or are working out</font>

1159
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:23,109
our schedule try to stack the deck for

1160
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,550
your success<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> things don't buy the bag of</font>

1163
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,609
Doritos if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the house you</font>

1164
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,130
don't want either okay you will try to

1165
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:36,310
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more exercise you know park at the</font>

1166
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">other end of the parking lot you know</font>

1167
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:41,619
make a reminder on your calendar to you

1168
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,390
know get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and walk every 25 minutes</font>

1169
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:45,640
just once around the office get the

1170
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:47,650
blood flowing bump<font color="#E5E5E5"> into somebody get a</font>

1171
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,299
good idea from whatever so sort of

1172
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:51,760
structure your environments to you know

1173
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:54,190
pump up<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a game</font>

1174
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,930
personal challenge have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> checklist of</font>

1175
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,170
hey every day I want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I do</font>

1176
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:01,839
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you you know</font>

1177
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:03,880
have a thing where you can sort of do

1178
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know get up and walk around every</font>

1179
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,869
once in a while get a pedometer and say

1180
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,030
hey you know today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

1181
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:11,920
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> five thousand steps which means</font>

1182
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:13,990
okay if I want to phone a check off

1183
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,880
today on my calendar i'm going to have

1184
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:17,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get up and walk around every once</font>

1185
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,119
awhile rather than just sitting there

1186
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,810
the whole time when i'm writing that

1187
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,460
program and a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask about</font>

1188
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:27,880
supplements you know should we you

1189
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:30,100
something vitamin D is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

1190
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,010
spend so much time inside and because

1191
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:36,130
being outside in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun is maybe not</font>

1192
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:39,280
good for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well vitamin D is one</font>

1193
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:42,550
that we probably should take and vitamin

1194
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,990
D is again a deficit here is really

1195
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:47,020
really implicated in development of

1196
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,790
cancer and several other diseases so if

1197
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,650
you're not if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't take any</font>

1198
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:52,779
supplements i would say probably adding

1199
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,369
a vitamin<font color="#E5E5E5"> d would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1200
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,700
have a look on learning that for the

1201
00:54:54,369 --> 00:55:00,279
research thing yes

1202
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:04,509
I think they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good marketing</font>

1203
00:55:00,279 --> 00:55:06,490
programs a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff for those if</font>

1204
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:08,319
you eat the regular balanced diet you

1205
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:10,328
probably are going to get some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1206
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,759
stuff enough of that stuff to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1207
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:15,369
the thing with supplements is that it's

1208
00:55:12,759 --> 00:55:18,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">very hard for the reductionist theory to</font>

1209
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:20,650
work out you know people who eat a lot

1210
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,328
of X get this chemical so if we give

1211
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,980
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a pill with that chemical</font>

1212
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:27,460
that will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it never</font>

1213
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:30,430
is you know with antioxidants with you

1214
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:32,140
know olive oil with you know almost any

1215
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things as well you know there's</font>

1216
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,950
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who eat this eat a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of food</font>

1217
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,140
with this in it if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give them a</font>

1218
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:40,089
pill for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it hasn't ever worked out</font>

1219
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there are a few that I think are</font>

1220
00:55:40,089 --> 00:55:44,799
probably going to be out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

1221
00:55:42,609 --> 00:55:47,980
stuffing great skins reservoir or

1222
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:49,420
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there probably is</font>

1223
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,980
something on those in two or three other

1224
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,509
ones so hopefully with the the research

1225
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:55,289
will finally pan out and everybody will

1226
00:55:52,509 --> 00:55:59,529
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what it is but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

1227
00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:01,750
other kind of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> bios things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1228
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:03,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the yogurt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's got active</font>

1229
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,829
bacterias or whatever yeah if you eat

1230
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,779
what four to eight of those a day it

1231
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:09,880
might regulate your<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you know</font>

1232
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:12,279
all the sugar in it sort of

1233
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">counterbalance is any benefit of a</font>

1234
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:16,420
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> bowel movement that it might</font>

1235
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,589
give us so I'm kind of doubtful for most

1236
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,750
anything that they're really really

1237
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:20,890
marketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz that I said they don't</font>

1238
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a lot of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know money when you</font>

1239
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:24,759
buy vegetables but if they can give you

1240
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">some chemical else they can sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a</font>

1241
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot higher I always recommend folic acid</font>

1242
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:33,940
for women because if you are of you know

1243
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,529
getting pregnant age it's really

1244
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to have a good amounts of</font>

1245
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:39,910
folic acid at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early stages of</font>

1246
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:42,160
presidency so that one there's other

1247
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:45,069
benefits of folic acid but but that one

1248
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,288
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known wants it add fiber if</font>

1249
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:50,288
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> else if you you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I love</font>

1250
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:51,880
pizza I love pizza but<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

1251
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:53,710
weeding there's good and something I try

1252
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,680
to make stuff that's pizza like lots

1253
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:59,769
tomato sauce meat veggies little crust

1254
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I eat regular pizza I don't</font>

1255
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:03,399
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know take something with a lot</font>

1256
00:57:01,509 --> 00:57:05,170
of fibrous either a fiber supplement or

1257
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,040
some fruit or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1258
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:09,080
does kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of help</font>

1259
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,970
south of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aster can't count on that every</font>

1260
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,529
meal but if you add fiber to your diet

1261
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:17,709
it's going to be a benefit I didn't get

1262
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:20,770
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it and have time</font>

1263
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:23,810
have any active mental and social life

1264
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:27,290
again because it I think our brains are

1265
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:28,940
really built for working with other

1266
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,650
people and all of the circuitry in there

1267
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,170
for facial recognition emotional

1268
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:35,150
recognition things like that I think the

1269
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:38,390
