Billy was supposed to do a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

fun alright cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> either gonna</font>

143
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:15,389
go incredibly well or incredibly bad so

144
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,889
well well depends on how far not the

145
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,160
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how much of this week ensue</font>

146
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:23,729
thank you Miss guy dog<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah thanks for</font>

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,770
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Corey yes yes so Adrian thank you</font>

148
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:29,280
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience is to lose it yes yes</font>

149
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,219
everybody loses um so kind of the reason

150
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,159
I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this is that sometime the</font>

151
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,199
most one I have it at hacker cons is not

152
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,910
so much watching technical talks though

153
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,760
I mean yeah you can see something that's

154
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,289
kind of interesting I've always kind of

155
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,669
been one of those people especially when

156
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:46,620
I was working at a company<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd hire</font>

157
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,240
people I never cared what was on their

158
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,979
resume like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the person</font>

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,229
I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what motivated them I</font>

160
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,090
wanted to know their stories I wanted to

161
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:57,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how they got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be where they were</font>

162
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,650
not do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> C sharp do you know XML</font>

163
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,120
do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this do you know that</font>

164
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,370
because competent people can pick that

165
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">shit up like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I was more</font>

166
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,539
interested in the people and then when

167
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,750
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to hackers I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

168
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,270
more interested not necessarily in oh I

169
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,560
worked on this cool topic and I like Mac

170
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,479
stripes and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done with</font>

171
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,650
mag stripes it was more of like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

172
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,050
you get there what interests you about

173
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,060
them what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel about this or that</font>

174
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,699
so that's kind of why I wanted to do

175
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,320
this and I've known Adrienne now for

176
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,580
several years I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> him talk a lot</font>

177
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,789
and adrian is is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people i</font>

178
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the hacker community needs more of</font>

179
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:36,990
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's he's pretty selfless he</font>

180
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wants to get up there and talk and</font>

181
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,949
kind of educate people and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

182
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,710
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a lot more of those folks</font>

183
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:45,050
in the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> so thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for being</font>

184
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,719
my victim Adrian a

185
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:50,270
yeah let me just start out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way</font>

186
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,860
victim victimized away we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of talked</font>

187
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,099
a little bit beforehand and you said

188
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,240
some interesting stuff and so I was

189
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering if you just kind of summarize</font>

190
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,710
like how what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> your first computer</font>

191
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:06,379
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it first one I</font>

192
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:08,359
actually owned I had a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> grandfather</font>

193
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,370
passed away at a great uncle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

194
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">mother had some money so she moved to</font>

195
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,710
the house she bought some new things and

196
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:18,710
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we got was a tandy</font>

197
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:21,169
1000 e<font color="#CCCCCC"> X so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was my first pc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font>

198
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,239
buy that radio shack yes that was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mat</font>

199
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,669
yeah settle stuff something like a trash

200
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,400
ad but um yeah it was bought from radio

201
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,139
shack and everything was proprietary and

202
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,260
you had to keep buying stuff video<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shack</font>

203
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,810
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mana ms-dos</font>

204
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,640
played around with that a lot and had a

205
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,429
buddy that lived two doors down who was

206
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,409
big into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Commodore scene and also</font>

207
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,170
the Amiga<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene he ran a bulletin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font>

208
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,120
system called madhouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> fed so I learned</font>

209
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit about those systems but I</font>

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,209
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really get into computers big</font>

211
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:55,729
time until I got into gonna trying to

212
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:58,399
school yeah so we talked a little bit

213
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,140
about this earlier so as when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

214
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,630
growing up you really like horror movies

215
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,760
and special effects and kind of wanted

216
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,040
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how did they do those</font>

217
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,189
things and this kind of led ultimately

218
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,939
to your interesting computers yes I was

219
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:16,130
well Megan who FX loved well zombie

220
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,079
films is to some extent to that point

221
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dom becomes much more now but what's</font>

222
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,000
your favorite zombie film that would be

223
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,790
Donna de in 1978<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay nice now if you</font>

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,699
want go outside of your strict<font color="#CCCCCC"> onra</font>

225
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,800
maybe army of darkness but it's kind of

226
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:33,380
more of a comedy action adventure thing

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,859
than it is a horror film so and it's

228
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,240
also pushing up those zombies<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

229
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,600
mmm that sometimes episode<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,759
mistake

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,350
but yeah I got into special effects I

232
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,269
saw how people make any things stuff

233
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,759
like what how can be put together props

234
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,670
how Tom Savini put together props and I

235
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,259
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some things involved</font>

236
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,939
animatronic so I figured well I'm

237
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,160
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going into a special</font>

238
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,810
effects makeup those are school do about

239
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,339
it teaches electronics that be a good

240
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,709
fallback of nothing else than I can use

241
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">that knowledge so at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this time by</font>

242
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:04,920
special effects what you're talking

243
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,069
about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> practical spectacle effects</font>

244
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,349
this would have been like 92 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

245
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:15,000
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so how so you're looking</font>

246
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">at kind of practical special effects and</font>

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,529
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking okay animatronics you</font>

248
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:21,569
know are kind of similar that like the

249
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:25,199
you know the thing and stuff like that

250
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:28,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">so how did you kind of transition from</font>

251
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:31,349
electronics into computers well well as

252
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:33,060
taking electronics I started taking some

253
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,680
programming classes as well as what like

254
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,849
what what were the program in a daily

255
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,670
first one so I think they were using

256
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,380
basic a 02 kind of like control the

257
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,550
servos and things like that no actually

258
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,750
we wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even use some servos at that</font>

259
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,569
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I think we didn't do some pics</font>

260
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,550
programming later on but no that was

261
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:49,199
just a into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> protein classroom itself</font>

262
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,839
to this necessarily have to do directly

263
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,339
with microcontrollers okay but what if

264
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,860
Adele was taught in basic a and then I

265
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">found a think it was a the turbo basic</font>

266
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,420
compiler and start doing some stuff in

267
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I started getting bigger in the</font>

268
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,329
programming then I was into electronics

269
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,709
so eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I decided to go off and I</font>

270
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,388
didn't quite finish the electronics

271
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:13,079
degree I went back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished it later</font>

272
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:15,680
and would start taking classes on

273
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:18,020
computer science to learn about

274
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,839
programming and so forth so what was it

275
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,910
about my boy yes that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great so what</font>

276
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,190
what was it kind of about computer

277
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,750
science as opposed to almost like more

278
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,450
like electrical engineering or the

279
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,310
electrical components of it what made

280
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,540
you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switch into that I don't I</font>

281
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,369
guess it was a creativity you can make a

282
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,439
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what you wanted to do like I</font>

283
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,700
I kind of start trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things</font>

284
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,080
before I really knew how to do them

285
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,339
right like uh like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first programming</font>

286
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,620
language they really taught us was basic

287
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,020
and basic can allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write some</font>

288
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,240
really shitty code and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance I</font>

289
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,160
the program languages i was using they

290
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,899
had the capabilities of doing functional

291
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,279
programming which would be a faucet

292
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">further but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't know about</font>

293
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,200
functions bad knew about go to so I had

294
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,910
this tic-tac-toe program<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had AI in</font>

295
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,640
it written in nothing but go tues it's

296
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:07,730
some pretty so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you t need some variables</font>

297
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,080
and like do a go to and then sets of

298
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,790
different variables and do a go to like

299
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,279
yeah she calls yes like poor man

300
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,079
functional yes that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

301
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,490
sad but it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking function and I</font>

302
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,770
guess I got a lot better at debugging

303
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,779
because of that I see it and did your

304
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:24,770
did your tic tac toe program helped

305
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,959
Joshua not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> world war three well it</font>

306
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,850
always win as long as I'm this way you

307
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,500
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never lose and it would always win</font>

308
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,779
if you didn't make your first move the

309
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,630
middle so it did pretty well I'm not

310
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:39,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure how to do against Josh widow so</font>

311
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,630
that's kind of cool what was that like a

312
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,300
class project like nice game I was um

313
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:47,480
didn't don't huh I think I had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

314
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,890
very part time job and I had spare time

315
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,500
I think I did with my brother pick me up

316
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,810
at the school so I just sat in the

317
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,279
computer lab programming okay see this

318
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool part this is what I like</font>

319
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,579
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the difference between I</font>

320
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,880
had a class that I had to do an

321
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,439
assignment and it's I was bored and

322
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,510
there's this really cool thing that can

323
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,459
do anything at world I got way too

324
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,400
interested in some sci-fi aspects also

325
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,989
because I started programming um

326
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,689
animations using basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue Yoda and</font>

327
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:16,480
designing stuff like I

328
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,590
you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them oh great well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then that</font>

329
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,210
rail gun isn't quite the right

330
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,580
terminology for it but like a

331
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,260
multi-stage coral can but proposed for

332
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,420
shooting up the side of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain to</font>

333
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,760
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something into yeah like the big</font>

334
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,650
guns that they have yeah launching

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,150
lights up in the low Earth and it was

336
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,199
reading books and it'll still travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

337
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,400
I saw what these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like oh</font>

338
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,870
that's cool they I can do an animation

339
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,860
on the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and that's the</font>

340
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:42,280
kind of thing I do in my spare time

341
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:43,690
really that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool um so when did</font>

342
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could make a career</font>

343
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,050
out of doing stuff with computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

344
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:52,560
yeah those enough people that seem to be

345
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:56,260
thank you very much I appreciate that

346
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,270
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw people getting jobs so it</font>

347
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,830
seemed reasonable and it's not people

348
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,390
going into it I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't really</font>

349
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:06,220
know what exactly I was going to do

350
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:07,300
career wise i mean i go i meandered most

351
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,220
of my life<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

352
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,760
careers at that age not really no I was

353
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:16,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think I was like 17 it got a high</font>

354
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,860
school so I was like well I got take

355
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,200
college of some kind i'll go do this

356
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to college close to home</font>

357
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,870
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool so did did you said that</font>

358
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,030
like when you were growing up some of

359
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,430
the you had some friends that were like

360
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:31,390
in the effects and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff as</font>

361
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,400
you did they end up going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> school</font>

362
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,870
that's what mostly just for me I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

363
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,079
buddy though who was into computers

364
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,380
specifically uh amigas and Commodores oh

365
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,960
ok so almost like amigas were really big

366
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,340
for like video editing yeah I'm posting

367
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,720
what the video toaster from him I think

368
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the back of my mind one of the</font>

369
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,140
reasons I gravitated out of

370
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">special-effects is well a few years</font>

371
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,640
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a year before I got high</font>

372
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,710
school I suppose a terminator<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 would</font>

373
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,920
come out and then a couple of liquid

374
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,150
metal and a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years after that</font>

375
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,069
Jurassic Park came out at that point

376
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,660
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going there isn't much that</font>

377
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,850
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to do a few</font>

378
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,680
years with computers let's set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

379
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:13,060
computers got it so but what made you

380
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,920
then did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into computers because</font>

381
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,869
you're like I like effects I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

382
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,449
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on almost the movie</font>

383
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,700
side of things it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems that it's moving</font>

384
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,470
away from practical effects and

385
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,760
animatronics into computer-generated

386
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,140
graphics let me do computer science so I

387
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,610
can go into kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computer graphics</font>

388
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,410
for movies well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I just like</font>

389
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,330
programming I telling the computer what

390
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,130
I wanted to do and making it do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

391
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,110
and I also started get into security

392
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,240
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I've always had the second for</font>

393
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,450
like a forbidden knowledge stuff that

394
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,790
wasn't supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know I grew up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

395
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:48,010
Oklahoma<font color="#E5E5E5"> City and way before nine eleven</font>

396
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,620
back when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a kid if you live in</font>

397
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,490
place that was least somewhat rule you

398
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,959
could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away with being a powder</font>

399
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:56,650
monkey my powder monkey i don't mean

400
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,819
cocaine right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean depending on it</font>

401
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,010
launched out literally living in the

402
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,480
city i mean back then it was because it

403
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,680
boys be boys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

404
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,940
the local drugstore finding various

405
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,209
chemicals mixed together the blow shit

406
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,880
up in the backyard<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you were like</font>

downloading<font color="#E5E5E5"> G files off of be back in</font>

408
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,820
the day I didn't have an anarchist

409
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,410
cookbook so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the g files</font>

410
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,730
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole lot of</font>

411
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,219

<font color="#E5E5E5">popular ones out there improvised</font>

430
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:04,439
weapons<font color="#E5E5E5"> found books on hacking or things</font>

431
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,819
laid the hacking right though now in

432
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,860
hindsight they weren't particularly good

433
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,539
i even tried to write a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it</font>

434
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,369
to paladin fest yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

435
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,990
bet it now it is a living hell out of me

436
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,678
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people don't seem to</font>

437
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,569
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that like hacking is not</font>

438
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,819
that it's accepted as a mainstream thing

439
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:23,039
now but it used to be way more

440
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:25,470
underground it was kind of lumped in yet

441
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,230
well the deal is using some packing with

442
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,940
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday end of illegal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

443
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,730
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've had a lawyer professor but</font>

444
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,620
apparently freaked out about that and I

445
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,590
had a mentality from the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who</font>

446
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,149
was my doing person who was my barber my

447
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,559
barber I expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> but once you supposed</font>

448
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,299
to get a law degree and you know have a

449
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,970
great studio<font color="#CCCCCC"> documenting something you'd</font>

450
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:47,059
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit better but it's so</font>

451
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,370
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the education does not equal</font>

452
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,629
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> so no that's interesting so</font>

453
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,360
actually let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that because</font>

454
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,860
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we may think hacking and</font>

455
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,629
security is kind of moving more

456
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,479
mainstream because you actually can have

457
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,460
a profession around it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt yes right</font>

458
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,890
which you wouldn't necessarily be able

459
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,570
to do before but outside you know you

460
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,039
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to most people and their perception</font>

461
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,030
of hacking is like what they see in

462
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,649
swordfish or you know on TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes I i got</font>

463
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,059
into hacking through the chicks yeah he

464
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:18,270
got into hacking for the chicks how do

465
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:20,970
you explain to people like like family

466
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,510
or relatives or you're at a cocktail

467
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,220
party right and someone's like you know

468
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:29,960
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes ago what do you</font>

469
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:31,970
have it so anyway how do you explain to

470
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,400
like regular people what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do I</font>

471
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,650
generally don't really just tell them I

472
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,150
do computers like speaking for my

473
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,260
grandmother<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely my mother my</font>

474
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,520
probably a little bit more she's just

475
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,490
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a job that pays</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

476
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">suppose grandmother I think she still</font>

477
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,330
has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that everything on</font>

478
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet is evil and there's all</font>

479
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:51,139
sorts of badness going on that the night

480
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,649
you'll go blind if all you watch is the

481
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,570
evening news that's what you're gonna so

482
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,910
like when you're at a cocktail party and

483
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,919
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I don't want</font>

484
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,690
to delay my eyes are like you're at a

485
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,340
party you're on a social<font color="#CCCCCC"> event that is</font>

486
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,320
not hacker related you're meeting people

487
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,820
and someone's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh Adrian what do you</font>

488
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,030

489
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,649
computers in inappropriate ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

490
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">assuming they continue to want to talk</font>

491
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you after you say that I basically</font>

492
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,219
say I do computer security work what do

493
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,540
most people think that means i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

494
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,250
think at that point most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that's</font>

495
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,889
actually in the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to board to ask</font>

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,480
they immediately soom surprise surprise

whatsoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some people free got</font>

546
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,370
about four bit of knowledge and some

547
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,750
people freak out about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

548
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,250
having some kind of potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> powder</font>

549

they don't understand like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

550
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:17,210
people freak out about guns because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

551
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,950
afraid of some object that someone else

has and it's some kind of power that

553

they don't grasp but understand somehow

554
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:24,260
fearful of I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that way</font>

555
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about knowledge and I've always liked</font>

556
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea of knowing things that aren't</font>

557
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,570
supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> known about</font>

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,520
doing this and said I'm a hacker and you

562
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:41,190
are afraid and that makes me you more

563
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,289
dangerous than I ever could be yeah I've

564
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,700
been recently I've actually accused of

565
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:46,620
threatening behavior because i've used

566
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,600
woods with people and did someone else

570
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:56,789
of threatening behavior because about

571
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,889
using woods obviously this is a very

572
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:00,870
threatening and imposing person right I

573
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:03,120
guess I'm a fairly large guy guess

574
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,799
that's what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and someone</font>

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,809
wouldn't cop to talk to me about God's

576
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,100

581
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">men country but some people get scared</font>

582
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,320
real easily of absolutely nothing and I

583
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,330
think that's one person who did wrong by

584
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,700
me and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to counter things and</font>

585
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,020
it bc seem to have taken the presents

<font color="#E5E5E5">like I'm concerned about it one thing</font>

674
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,530
much more novel because now you can run

675
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,360
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff on my android phone yeah</font>

678
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">i thought right about that putting on my</font>

679
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,700
website and now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting more</font>

680

681
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,150
should buy my own domain and so i moved

682
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,860
everything off it and posted other

683
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,440
security stuff though slightly before

684
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> soros i was actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw a tool</font>

685
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,370
called camstudio and so how you can make

686

screencast I was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow there's all</font>

687
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,639
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little security tools out there</font>

688
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,709
are nifty to play with but they have a

689
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,170
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a learning curve to ya so I</font>

690
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,150
started like here's a man file have fun

691
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I start doing videos on those and</font>

692
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,720
posting them so that those two things

693

699
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,390
problematic yes I last I checked when I

early early two thousand four<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

712
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,990
let's we kind of jumped pretty far into

713
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:13,729
it walk me through you know you're out

715
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,080
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> deciding that practical effects</font>

716
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,758
electronics probably isn't the way to go

717
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested in programming you're</font>

718
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,490
kind of playing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it how do</font>

719
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,370
you go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to making tutorials</font>

720
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,320
about hacking tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always had</font>

721
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:32,840
an interesting forbidden knowledge and I

722
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,418
saw uh messing around with school

723
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,709
systems and we used to use Nobel as i

724
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:38,509
read novell manuals like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ooh you could</font>

725
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,070
do this this and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

726
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commands hey I didn't lock down</font>

727
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,418
shit oh you know you really make up a

728
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:47,059
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> users on oh this is some kind of</font>

729
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:49,370
HP Otis<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a printer monitor account</font>

730
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:53,149
can't log into it oh it's like an ad man

<font color="#CCCCCC">locket but they didn't and you see the</font>

737
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:08,750
novell logins and it was all well I

738
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,418
can't say kisses base but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font>

739
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:15,019
was all text right and it was easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

740
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:18,259
emulate a login screen for novell<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

741
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:20,330
adding a simple basic program so<font color="#CCCCCC"> user</font>

742
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:22,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like backdoor the login program to</font>

743
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,408
put up your own unless saying what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did</font>

744
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,029
this but yeah something like that but

745
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:28,039
essentially yeah it basically would

746
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">pumped up the same prompts and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

747
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,419
you long and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ooh bad password you</font>

748
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,769
entered the right password prompt you

749
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,379
bad pass but then it would start<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

750
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:39,259
actual login so you basically put in

751
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:41,959
basic no less you put technically my

752
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:45,080
turbo basic turbo basic you put a fake

753
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,960
login in front of whatever novell system

754
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,490
was running to capture passwords yes I

755
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,500
didn't do anything bad of him but out

756
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:55,370
this kind of curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> whack what I've</font>

757
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:57,920
done that's awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok cool so the</font>

758
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,959
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're at college</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

759
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all this amazing hardware and</font>

760
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,140
networking and you're exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

761
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,090
sorts of software you haven't seen and

762
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,559
you're doing shit log then and there in

763
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,169
there isn't shit logged out so you just

764
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,210
kind of start poking and playing yawning

765
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,220
pretty much what was the thing that you

766
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,390
found during those formative years that

767
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,340
like shocked you the most where you're

768
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,620
like surely they can't be this stupid oh

769
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,428
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god they were open to shit on default</font>

770
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,139
you scared a network I don't do exploit

771
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,670
development I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you were</font>

772
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,170
talking about understanding memory

773
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,340
structures and so father Lee I need to

774
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,380
get a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> grass to that cuz I'd like</font>

775
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,340
to understand things better or the truth

776
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the matter is there's so much</font>

777
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:35,678
low-hanging fruit out there yeah you can

778
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,700
make a career out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing nothing but</font>

779
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,880
vulnerability scans but ancient

780
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:44,210
unpatched crap and shares that shit up

781
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,490
to everyone and blank or default

782
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,230
passwords yeah you know we're seeing

783
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,090
that a lot today right with SCADA

784
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,530
systems this whole like oh well this

785
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,120
system was ever intended to be connected

786
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as they keep</font>

787
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,070
it knocking out in it that might be okay

788
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,190
but it's it's ancient you know NT for

789
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:03,200
windows 2000 boxes they're not patched

790
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,730
it where offs and dies yep yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

791
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,960
let's do research on printers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

792
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,429
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those a lot of printers who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

793
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,410
somewhat sensitive she talked about

794
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">printers a couple times like we're those</font>

795
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,200
just low hanging fruit on the network

796
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,790
well I saw putting us out that I saw no

797
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,110
one had will of tutorials out there so

798
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,820
it's like one will stop fucking around

799
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,840
punches and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found</font>

800
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,840
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about fucking around with printers</font>

801
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,889
was a way back in the day in map<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

802
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

803
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,200
2005 2004 we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were sent a probe he'll</font>

804
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,059
just send the probe will put it was

805
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,070
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what it was and it</font>

806
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:33,020
would say just part of the port scan of

807
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,070
the OS detection actually this would be

808
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,220
part of that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

809
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,500
detection okay but it hit bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9100</font>

810
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,850
and on the average HP printer you

811
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire team of paper because every</font>

812
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,020
single famous in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port 9102 oh come</font>

813
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,449
on the printer wait so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like</font>

814
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:51,530
raw you send a packet whatever's in that

815
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:54,530
it gets printed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready much whoa okay and</font>

816
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,970
so I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fueled about that um you</font>

817
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,320
know this might be slightly problem so

818
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,230
it was added some one of those I can't

819
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,149
know his terminology for it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

820
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:05,360
what's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful with so by default</font>

821
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:08,420
in map won't now do probes at 90 100

822
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,340
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay possibly let's</font>

823
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,140
say it's open right<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't sensitive cuz</font>

824
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,189
otherwise could potentially all of our

825
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,940
campus and this is what i was doing

826
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,590
legitimate scans it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wasting</font>

827
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,510
reams of paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> campus whenever not</font>

828
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">scanned up in math so you're just</font>

829
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,800
scanning the the campus<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and like</font>

830
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,420
printers around campus<font color="#E5E5E5"> just freaked out</font>

831
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,800
yet don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll bring out made her</font>

832
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,850
acquaintance were you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

833
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,220
they were just printing like one

834
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,540
character of gibberish oh ok you know

835
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,790
it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something like a basically</font>

836
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">equivalent of grabbing a header did you</font>

837
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:38,720
ever thought to like send messages from

838
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,670
God to people you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this have done</font>

839
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,670
that got in trouble of debt once too oh

840
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,940
yeah don't you don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain</font>

841
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,010
things HL because whoever has the power

842
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get to explain things they</font>

843
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,240
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to you wait you had to go</font>

844
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,240
with the HR office and they're like

845
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a letter from God and we 40</font>

846
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,890
actually I was going to nada con to give

847
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:02,720
a talk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> posted this on this</font>

848
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,280
website where you could go and you have

850
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,450
a webcam you could see what was peering

851
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,490
on the screen because you could set so

852
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,290
you like pointed a webcam at the printer

853
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,640
yeah and the screen you should you say

854
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,230
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert coin or whatever</font>

855
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,250
apparently someone was flowing racial

856
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,050
slurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there that showed from the</font>

857
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,060
video and also they got freaked out and

858
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,620
I got compared with bad judgment and

859
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,169
compared negatively the two people who

860
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,239
made way more money than I am wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait</font>

861
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,310
was sorry more money and I'm shoot wait

862
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,420
more money than I did yeah and couldn't

863
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,070
do the things I did and just a general

864
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,410
abusive behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> for someone could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

865
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a dhryn don't do that crap right I</font>

866
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,770
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lost faith in</font>

867
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,439
well get enough space<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HR people and</font>

868
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,690
came to the conclusion that don't expect

869
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,750
actual due process or people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay</font>

870
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:47,040
attention to you so as as somebody who

871
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,840
has been sued I think this is an

872
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,490
interesting point right because pretty

873
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,750
much everybody hits this where you kind

874
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,490
of like lose your innocence and you're

875
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,410
like you're like hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can admit doing</font>

876
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,910
something wrong but the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

877
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:59,130
people went after being right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

878
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,020
what actually I think later on it came

879
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,420
out that part of it made men that I was

880
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,160
running a<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum system that was talking</font>

881
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,290
about things that the university was

882
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,120
doing that wasn't particularly good for

883
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,320
students and I think they use that is

884
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,000
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the excuses to take that down</font>

885
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,409
because I mean one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways people</font>

886
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,679
found out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was because of the</font>

00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:52,220
did you I I guess it's kind of an easy

1041
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,040
transaction because you are a transition

1042
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,770
but you were already about let's

1043
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,230
document things on iron geek<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm let's</font>

1045
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,640

1048
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">in at ND to wanting to present I thought</font>

1049
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,950
I had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I hadn't seen</font>

1050
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,970
presented before I was like well I like

1051
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,250
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in front of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1052
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,189

1053
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,630

1054
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,060
first card stock of a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that was</font>

1055
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,220
probably the cybersecurity summit in

1056
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,320
indianapolis that are you put on and it

1057
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,439
was on like basic password cracking and

1058
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,240
password exploits and odds and ends like

1059
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,580
that like well here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font>

1060
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,189
I'll admin password hashes are so weak

1061
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,040
right explain it and that was like the

1062
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:44,360
very first should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put on and then the</font>

1063
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,860
nautic on one in 2006 was a affect the

1064
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,130
first hack econo actually presented at

1065
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,710

1066
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,560
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was presenting on a boat's PE</font>

1067
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,150
build or whatnot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

1068
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,000
built and then i start speaking one more

1069
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:02,240
and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> started doing some classes for my</font>

1070
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">local issa chapter and one of the core</font>

1071
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,299
my own stuff so i started messing<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

1072
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">more and more with video equipment and</font>

1073
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,210
eventually got enough video equipment

1074
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,070
and got<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i start</font>

1075
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,960
doing videos of<font color="#CCCCCC"> other conferences and</font>

1076
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,940
now a lot of my content isn't even my

1077
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,850
content it's someone else talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

1078
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,740
so that's kind of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I've as</font>

1079
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:22,310
someone who has talked a lot and did on

1080
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">your site normally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well drunk how how</font>

1081
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">did you decide like I should film these</font>

1082
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,790
people and ask the conference's whether

1083
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,760
I can film them and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish it like</font>

1084
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,050
free content so literally you were just

1085
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,020
looking for more stuff to put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> iron</font>

1086
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:37,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">key calm largely i got i see i won't be</font>

1087
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,650
hypocritical and i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how much</font>

1088
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">was altruistic and how much is purely</font>

1089
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,340
papa motor bringing more people come to

1090
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,230
my site so it's hard for me to say but I

1091
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,020
mean the comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PM me</font>

1092
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:49,530
coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and I think I drive at</font>

1093
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,750
least

1094
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,820
some publicity for the conference sure

1095
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,670
and they get someone to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I</font>

1096
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,350
get more content the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker's get the</font>

1097
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,240
name out there because that's various

1098
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,520
because I google search the name my web

1099
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,229
site comes up first so there aren't a

1100
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,960
lot of hacker<font color="#E5E5E5"> Collins kind of like in</font>

people to pitch in and help and I like

1199
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,120
divisive instead of just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font>

1203
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:22,140
kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the massive amount of</font>

1204
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,880
certificates that have kind of pushed

1205
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,420
into the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> space where it's like</font>

00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,070
oh you need a cissp to do this oh you

1207
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,950
need this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a negative impression</font>

1208
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,570
in general of HR types but at the same

1209
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,220
time I also recognize they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1210
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:38,430
something that filter with from sho-me

1211
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:40,169
people winning certain jobs and a cert

1212
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,750
is no worse than a college degree for

1213
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,160
proving you know something not not

1214
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:46,740
saying that it actually proves anything

1215
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:49,440
but take the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still be the best</font>

1216
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:51,390
way is a hide from people you know

1217
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately that also gets to be a bit</font>

1218
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a good old boy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good oh gosh system</font>

1219
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">measure nepotism isn't the right one for</font>

1220
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a bit of</font>

1221
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,990
cronyism going on there sure so it's

1222
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,500
it's a devil if you do devil if you

1223
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:06,359
don't sort of situation um so I see the

1224
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,550
value of suits as at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least the baseline</font>

1225
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,310
like okay it was able to pass this so he

1226
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:13,320
must have this bit of knowledge even he

1227
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,460
can't practically you know apply it at

1228
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">least knows the words I'm saying</font>

1229
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,740
hopefully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just understand the words</font>

1230
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,840
that are coming out of my mouth so

1231
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,810
English do you speak English do you

1232
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,670

1233
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,610

1246
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,920
feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like a racket right it feels</font>

1247
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,410
like we do universities feel like a

1248
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,360
racket to me so I'm okay with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this least</font>

1249
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:12,069
it's a much shorter amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1250
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,870
in the racket I guess um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so kind of</font>

1251
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:16,450
along that line we were talking a little

1252
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,910
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier about a you know messing</font>

1253
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,370
around on a college network and then HR

1254
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,379
talking to you and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1255
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:26,109
were joking earlier about pirating

1256
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:29,110
Photoshop there's kind of this trend in

1257
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,970
ethics with hacking right and i'm

1258
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:32,470
interested in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts we were</font>

1259
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:33,490
talking earlier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we could</font>

1260
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:37,209
kind of have the conversation almost

1261
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:38,890
again you know it those who talk to most

1262
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,290
about ethics understand the least it's

1263
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:44,529
been my personal experience no good call

1264
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,910
so but we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some so we'll</font>

1265
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,740
see how little we know that's right so

1266
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:52,029
if you find a security issue in a

1267
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:54,490
product do you kind of feel responsible

1268

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting that issue I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

responsible reporting it by be careful

1270
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,170
who had bought it too<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'd might look</font>

1271
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,980
up the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font>

1272
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:05,860
company it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sooo crazy I'm like okay</font>

1273
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,970
full disclosure anonymously right yes if

1274
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,340
they seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of people that</font>

1275
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:13,299
are well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's a problem oh shit</font>

1276
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:15,640
fuck fix it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> do put it the chain</font>

1277
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,900
to a negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin policy or whatever</font>

1278
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:21,609
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really does the pin i</font>

1279
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,570
bet i'm not using the position to find

1280
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of thing because most the</font>

1281
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,290
things i find us it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be known</font>

1282
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,180
issues that people just didn't configure

1283
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:29,920
things right it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to learn</font>

1284
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,520
about what's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that i</font>

1285
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,140
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the low-hanging fruit</font>

1286
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,270
individual exploits go away they get

1287
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,600
patched and fixed right a bad design

1288
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:42,850
decisions and bad configurations last

1289
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,589
forever i completely agree i've always

1290
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,509
been much more interested in design

1291
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:49,330
flaws<font color="#E5E5E5"> in technology there's always been</font>

1292
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:50,950
a long-running some service as

1295
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:57,280
printing like who print queue<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

owner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is something admin that's</font>

1297
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,810
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good I don't know of a particular</font>

1298
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,370
exploit that you could sit in like you

1299
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,400
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a postscript file that would fuck</font>

1300
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:07,839
up that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cooling system or</font>

1301
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,190
that particular print tracking system

1302
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:15,700
but that should not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> advent yeah so</font>

1303
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,640
how do you go about I mean you were

1304
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,919
working at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a university I'm sure you saw</font>

1305
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">university networks are right we don't</font>

1306
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more fucked over than they do like I</font>

1307
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,830
maybe they doing this don't know it's

1308
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,880
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I put out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of college</font>

1309
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:29,410
students and griping they owned since

1310
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,630
ethics isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> high so it's not that</font>

1311
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:33,370
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ethics is Kim doing it but I'm</font>

1312
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,130
surprised there's not more students

1313
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:39,940
stealing free print jobs it's like so

1314
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:42,100
pathetically easy but I don't see them

1315
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,320
doing it maybe they're doing it I'm not

1316
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,740
seeing it so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of</font>

1317
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,350
retreated a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being open</font>

1318
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:53,470
and testing the things that you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1319
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,390
so let's say you work at a company do

1320
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,799
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of this is along the</font>

1321
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,089
ethics I'd you know you're working in a

1322
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,220
company let's say it's university

1323
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,020
because they tend to have a large number

1324
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,819
of networks that are of all different

1325
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">types there</font>

1326
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,660
you know controlled by different

1327
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,360
departments you kind of view it as all

1328
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:12,100
right to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know wat it or</font>

1329
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,200
you know not necessarily i'm not saying

1333
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,410

interesting ok cool so is there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1412
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,859
anything you wish you could like if I

1413
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,598
had a time machine I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adrian like</font>

1414
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:24,190
you know doc brown and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got back</font>

1415
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:26,769
when this baby hits 88 miles per hour

1416
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:29,140
and all that if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and on</font>

1417
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:31,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 years when I even said you're 15</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">years and tell your past self so it's</font>

1419
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:40,720
what is that 2019<font color="#CCCCCC"> 97-98 you go back to</font>

1421
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,669
related to stocks or something that

1422
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:47,109
would allow you to be you know japen why

1423
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:48,640
I don't apple looks like is it the

1424
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:50,288
shitter right now but the Steve Jobs

1425
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,529
character I think he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got another one</font>

1426
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:55,299
in it right like you can't say that if

1427
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:59,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say something to kind of like</font>

1428
00:53:55,299 --> 00:54:03,009
alter how what you focused on with

1429
00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:05,319
computers would you possibly say<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

1430
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:07,390
even more on computer security aspect

1431
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:10,808
read more books play with more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1432
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:12,700
technology and get a real job in the

1433
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:14,559
real world sooner because you'd probably

1434
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,749
make a whole lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money Keshari</font>

1435
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,460
might be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> stressful you might have</font>

1436
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:21,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough money to be tired by now so are</font>

1438
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:26,920
that's Rob's working on finishing up my

1439
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,600
master's degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh wow though machine</font>

1440
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,490
learning

1441

teachers doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good job of trying to</font>

1442
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,970
teach but I'm not to stay picking it up

1443
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,300
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been too long since I've had</font>

1444
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:39,279
calculus linear algebra and a buttload

1445
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,960
of matrix mathematics exactly seriously

1446
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,330
they start talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

1447
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,470
here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna simulate a neuron and</font>

1448
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:46,360
this is the neural network and here's

1449
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:49,480
the matrix transform we're gonna apply

1450
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,280
you're just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> frost / yeah but yeah</font>

1451
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,790
good job of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by I think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need a</font>

1452
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">different text book than what we have</font>

1453
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,580
but actually there's a book I saw from

1454
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,510
ovata is called a machine learning for

1455
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:00,430
hackers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like it actually</font>

1456
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:02,110
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something I like something's</font>

1457
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,970
actually applied like we have promised

1458
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:06,580
all give them sample code dozen similar

1459
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:09,669
right act this apart to make it do what

1460
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:11,880
you needed to do it so kind of along

1461
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:15,420
that line I mean you do a lot with

1462
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:18,580
publishing videos publishing how to's

1463
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,380
have you ever done any open source code

1464
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,020
or written things like that well

1465
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything I write receipt my coding</font>

1466
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,880
techniques is pretty sloppy like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you</font>

1467
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:29,260
don't want anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your bed I use</font>

1468
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:33,670
functions now but a lot of shit still

1469
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:36,370
looks like go to go to this function so

1470
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:37,780
in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all just jumps I'm not</font>

1471
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,890
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big project the biggest</font>

1472
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,240
product I've ever been a part of it I

1473
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:43,270
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and someone else took it over</font>

1474
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,979
was mattila day and then what was on

1475
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,560
that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> mattila was deliberately</font>

1476
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,790
vulnerable PHP which isn't hard it

1477
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,040
doesn't take much programming scale to

1478
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:53,170
make deliberately vulnerable PHP apps

1479
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement all the OS</font>

1480
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,910
top 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh like it's like a learning tool</font>

1481
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:00,100
yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> because found stone has like their</font>

1482
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">hackneyed bank and hack me this but I</font>

1483
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:05,380
want some super intro Ryan it showed

1484
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:07,089
exactly 20 I stopped luckily in PHP you

1485
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,770
can totally and that was so easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1486
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,120
then I hand it off and Jeremy drew ins

1487
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,610
been taking them done a wonderful job on

1488
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,410
it Oh stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source pretty much</font>

1489
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,970
everything I write it just gets phone up

1490
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,589
down as a script like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put it</font>

1491
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,180
what license on I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw it out</font>

1492
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:21,130
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying if I say any kind</font>

1493
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,779
license like it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the credits</font>

1494
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,160
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the code got so it's not even</font>

1495
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:25,780
like open source is literally public

1496
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,730
domain here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cody much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

1497
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:29,770
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't usually slap a license on</font>

1498
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,440
it so are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just putting this on your</font>

1499
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,730
site or using like github or

1500
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,369
just put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my side I need to look</font>

1501
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:37,260
more into a source code repositories and

1502
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:38,550
actual versioning and all that but since

1503
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:41,550
it's usually just me working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1504
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:43,230
what's the point yeah shoo interesting

1505
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:45,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I do some simple script</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

1506
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:47,369
silly thing like okay I need to collect

1507
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:49,680
the configs and all these Cisco devices

1508
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:52,200
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll mix on the ssh isn't the every</font>

1509
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,049
one of them does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> show but and pulls it</font>

1510
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,230
down and saves it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if you</font>

1511
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:00,470
could work at Microsoft for a day and

1512
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:03,869
any decisions you made were binding

1513
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:06,379
after you left what would you do whole

1514

using hacking techniques to promote a

01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:28,160
exploiting someone for those purposes I

1696
01:04:25,789 --> 01:04:30,039
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1697
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,940
were using hacking techniques as in

1698
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:34,700
programming or understanding systems

1699
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:36,410
work or taking total garbage and making

1700
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">something useful out of it then I'm cool</font>

1701
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:39,319
of it that volunteers of to him hacking

1702
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,480
means so many things that med student

1703
01:04:39,319 --> 01:04:44,569
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason Scott has an analogy that</font>

he uses about<font color="#E5E5E5"> bikers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that biker 21 put</font>

1705
01:04:44,569 --> 01:04:48,019
biker means that i'm totally dividend to

1706
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,029
a different biker and hacker means

1707
01:04:48,019 --> 01:04:51,379
different things to different hackers so

1708
01:04:50,029 --> 01:04:53,180
depends on what you mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

1709
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Johnny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Long's hackers for charity that's</font>

1710
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:59,538
a hacktivist group the activists who are

1711
01:04:55,910 --> 01:05:01,549
hackers but also people who label some

1712
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:02,809
synonymous and I all new boots have been

1713
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:04,670
honest i Dessay have a problem if that

1714
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:07,120
the people were screwed Scientology more

1715
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,560
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

1716
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,089
but those<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't not say all the same</font>

1717
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,920
people because the anonymous isn't one

1718
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:16,210
single group was referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

1719
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,850
you know the media different you can't

1720
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:20,110
really know hi so what know this

1721
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:22,360
actually opens an interesting line of

1722
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:23,890
questions I got go ahead was it a

1723
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,660
question of hacktivism over whether a

1724
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:29,170
question of ethics because to me for

1725
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:30,790
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give a shit you can go and</font>

1726
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:32,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Magra for all the right reasons are all</font>

1727
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,810
the wrong reasons and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still packed</font>

1728
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,790
the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's a chemical</font>

1729
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">line though and I'm not saying don't do</font>

1730
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:41,170
it or I don't know people would do it

1731
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:43,210
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say that effort why did</font>

1732
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,590
you break in and manipulate somebody

1733
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">else's shit because you find the plug</font>

1734
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:48,970
whatever your agenda is you still

1735
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,590
crossed that ending line whether or not

1736
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:53,529
you care about right people on phone

1737
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:58,270
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I go with gun has been cross</font>

1738
01:05:53,530 --> 01:06:03,130
my favorite ethicals up well I'm trying

1739
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put my favorite favorite uh the type</font>

1740
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:08,920
of lube it's not exactly a theory it's

1741
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:11,170
not exactly ethical framework it's not

1742
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,270
too awful yeah well my favorite ethical

1743
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:16,750
philosophy probably comes from Immanuel

1744
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:18,670
Kant and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the categorical imperative yeah</font>

1745
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:20,170
it's doing versions of what people

1746
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:22,570
interpret the categorical imperative is

1747
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,160
being one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is you know do it if</font>

1748
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:26,920
it's only logically consistent to

1749
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,319
everybody do it another one is do it if

1750
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:30,910
you can wish to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a universal that</font>

1751
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,770
everybody does it and those subtle

1752
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:34,390
difference is that but my thing is it's

1753
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:35,890
all it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit like you're doing</font>

1754
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:38,049
those you'd have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> do unto me but</font>

1755
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,549
that was true that truly worked i'd be

1756
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,940
going up to have a beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> woman and</font>

1757
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:45,530
you know sitting on her lap and wiggling

1758
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">black is not that is not going out but</font>

1759
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:53,450
but that's why I took your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pants off but</font>

1760
01:06:50,450 --> 01:06:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do things as you wish them to be</font>

1761
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:58,250
made a universal like is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to kill</font>

1762
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,960
this person well if everybody killed it

1763
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:01,520
someone else right that would break down

1764
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,250
that's an extreme case but sometimes

1765
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:08,690
extreme case described it oh we got to

1766
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:12,320
Hitler already<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right off</font>

1767
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:14,030
mic right now but uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know can you</font>

1768
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,490
wishes be a universal would you want

1769
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:18,050
everybody to do this you would you want

1770
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:21,500
someone hacking your particular

1771
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:22,760
political fan base what and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1772
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,810
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> you on this because you said</font>

1773
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,760
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting earlier you're</font>

1774
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:27,140
like oh anonymous know some of those

1775
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,200
kids ready some of the guys hacking

1776
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:32,089
about Scientology then that's okay I'm

1777
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,710
not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to taking hacking them but</font>

1778
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:35,120
if they're standing outside and causing

1779
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:37,010
a ruckus and causing people to go look

1780
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,990
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operation clambake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no sure I'm</font>

1781
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:41,330
cool with that so what you're saying is

1782
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:43,580
you don't think it's ever I don't have

1783
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:45,110
ethical to detail somebody to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1784
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:48,560
to shut them up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is sense of</font>

1785
01:07:45,110 --> 01:07:50,420
shit<font color="#E5E5E5"> shit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good that makes sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1786
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jesus anybody so what you're saying is</font>

1787
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:57,290
not using not using techniques of

1788
01:07:55,090 --> 01:08:00,080
infiltrating computers or disrupting

1789
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:02,240
computers against peep it's not

1790
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:04,910
justified<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that against someone</font>

1791
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:06,830
just because you disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them for</font>

1792
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:07,759
whatever we all some subtle lines for

1793
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:10,310
instance if you are an oppressive

1794
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,140
country if you're using tor to get the

1795
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,660
hell out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could very well be seen in</font>

1796
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:18,229
the type of hacking and you know what

1797
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:19,970
good for you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's almost a that's</font>

1798
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:22,339
almost in the sense that I believe my

1799
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,230
internet traffic should not be monitored

1800
01:08:22,339 --> 01:08:26,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">by a third party and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should not be</font>

1801
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:29,209
judged by a third party and so to

1802
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,790
enforce that belief i'm going to use tor

1803
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:35,630
I i think it's it's almost you're using

1804
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:37,220
the technology to enforceable leaf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1805
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:38,660
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's like well if</font>

1806
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,870
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a country where that belief is</font>

1807
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:45,380
true use tor don't use tor but it's your

1808
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:46,490
your kind of exercising right lack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1809
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:50,510
better term

1810
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:52,090
because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a I mean right I guess</font>

1811
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,300
right it well the only likes you

1812
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:57,529
obviously I believe in rights as a

1813
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,870
metaphysical thing I believe in rights

1814
01:08:57,529 --> 01:09:01,550
but unfortunately practical personal

1815
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:02,990
experiences led me to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1816
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:04,520
only writes that truly exists are those

1817
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:06,170
that you can enforce with personal power

1818
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right we've already gotten the</font>

1819
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,970
