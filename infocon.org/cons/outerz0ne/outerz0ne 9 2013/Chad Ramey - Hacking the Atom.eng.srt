1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:09,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we'll save that for later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:11,120
cued up and ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go all right that</font>

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:14,239
we're good we're live so again this is

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,549
chad<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ramey on hacking the atom thank you</font>

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,080
buddy thank you everyone its first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,070
all it's been great to see people that

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,720
I've talked to at conventions before so

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,470
if you've seen one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talks at</font>

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">dragoncon or freaknic this time this</font>

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,330
talk is new and improved with more

11
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,420
nuclear physics<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah nuclear physics so</font>

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,710
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something new for everyone</font>

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,310
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop me at any point in the</font>

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk I'm gonna try to go into as much</font>

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,880
detail as I can without going into too

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,690
much detail and without being too

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,300
complex and hopefully everyone will have

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,059
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time and nothing will explode</font>

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,480
we've all heard of trust exercises yes

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:01,940
like trust Falls thank you this is more

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,390
of a this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a nuclear trust</font>

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,360
exercise so but it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,970
I'll begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction most</font>

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,650
commonly I get asked the question why

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,150
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing this why do you have a</font>

26
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,250
nuclear reactor why have you spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

27
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,280
much money doing this I'll sort of

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,440
address that you have science for sure

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,810
well I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to attempt to explain</font>

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,090
nuclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> fusion and nuclear physics and</font>

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,760
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see how that</font>

32
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,710
goes I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this reactor</font>

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,409
works i'll talk about the particle

34
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,119
accelerator that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm currently designing</font>

35
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,580
to hopefully generate antimatter in my

36
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,490
garage<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do a demo and we'll have</font>

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">some questions so hopefully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a</font>

38
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,289
good time

39
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,279
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can figure out how to advance the</font>

40
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:50,439
slides I guess I'll go with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> button so</font>

41
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,270
anyways I suppose an introduction as an

42
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,789
older I'm Chad<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ramey as they mentioned</font>

43
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,830
i'm currently serving out my time at

44
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:00,009
georgia tech as a sophomore of computer

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,960
science at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment in my free time I</font>

46
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,360
work at a place on Georgia Tech campus

47
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,979
called the invention studio I work as an

48
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,570
undergraduate laboratory instructor I

49
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,038
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure mechanical</font>

50
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,609
engineering students don't mess up our

51
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:15,010
really nice machines I'm a 3d printer

52
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,959
master meaning that I'm maintain a fleet

53
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,700
of like 15 3d printers that we have

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,410
there on campus so if you ever around

55
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,119
Georgia Tech and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

56
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,970
really cool machine shop you can always

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,980
hit me up and i'll show you around as

58
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,440
hobbies<font color="#E5E5E5"> i play lots of music</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font>

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,850
drifting my car this picture of me

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
drifting with my one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends</font>

61
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,890
running in terror and nuclear physics

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,810
which has been sort of an odd hobby of

63
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,929
mine but perhaps the most gratifying

64
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">evolved my hobbies so why do i do</font>

65
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,580
nuclear physics first of all to learn

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,859
someone yelled science I think that's

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,709
one of my favorite yes thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

68
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:53,079
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that going on so it's just like to</font>

69
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,989
do science<font color="#E5E5E5"> to science as one should say</font>

70
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:58,959
and when I was in high school I got

71
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,010
really really bored with classes I feel

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,650
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really learning anything</font>

73
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,170
it was all super basic and by junior

74
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,790
year I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font>

75
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,530
big I want to generate real data I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

76
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do an experiment that actually proves</font>

77
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,660
something or explore something different

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a year of so thinking</font>

79
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,799
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I found a website called</font>

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,090
fuser net so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

81
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,859
anything I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the day to check</font>

82
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,450
out fuser net it's a great resources

83
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:24,670
where I started learn all my stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

84
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,230
found fuser net and saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

85
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,578
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> these nuclear reactors in their</font>

86
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,730
garage and I said hey that sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

87
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:33,100
cool idea then after about six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of</font>

88
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,640
convincing my parents they thought hey

89
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:39,010
it's a cool idea so four years later

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,010
it's it's here in front of us it took

91
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">about three years to build but I'll go</font>

92
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">into that a little later</font>

93
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I tried you though okay I can't use the</font>

94
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,790
arrow keys cool beans I tried using up

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,470
and down but apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> sidon anyways I</font>

96
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,298
really like doing this because at a

97
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,010
point you start realizing that you are

98
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:02,799
actually tampering with the things that

99
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,149
make up everything and I don't know if

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,040
it's a weird power kick or something

101
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,690
like that but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that you can turn</font>

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,040
the switch and actually do things with

103
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,319
Adams is oddly gratifying to me I think

104
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,769
humankind is advancing the point where

105
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,820
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going past our energy supply and I</font>

106
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,668
think we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need something in</font>

107
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,219
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future or very near future fission</font>

108
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:27,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">or fusion I think nuclear is the way to</font>

109
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,620
go for us particularly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fusion</font>

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,400
recently there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fukushima Daiichi</font>

111
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,169
and Chernobyl I think these reactors can

112
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,620
touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lot of the safety issues of</font>

113
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,150
traditional fission reactors and almost

114
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,130
kind of be implemented in ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve</font>

115
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,429
them I'll talk that a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

116
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:49,360
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fusion is clean</font>

117
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:53,050
and renewable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go into all</font>

118
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,400
the maths let's cover some basis Adams

119
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,289
small particles that make up everything

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">consist of electrons protons and</font>

121
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:03,599
neutrons science isotopes are atoms with

122
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,849
different variations in their neutrons

123
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,860
ions are charged<font color="#E5E5E5"> atoms so normally the</font>

124
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:12,219
universe favors a sort of order<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

125
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,740
atoms and other particles will tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,440
group themselves in systems that are at

127
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,120
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of equilibrium so atoms will tend</font>

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,889
to have a number of electrons and

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,810
protons that are balanced out so they

130
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,270
carry a neutral charge they're not

131
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,800
charged positively or negative the nice

132
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,599
thing about that is if we apply a little

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
bit of brute force we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock off some</font>

134
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,469
electrons and they become charged and we

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,450
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with them and that's what</font>

136
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,080
powers this reactor talk about a little

137
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,909
bit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally hydrogen perhaps the</font>

138
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,219
most simple element

139
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,860
one of one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that's essential</font>

140
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,840
to our life here has one<font color="#CCCCCC"> proton in one</font>

141
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Neutron it's very very or one proton and</font>

142
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,469
one electron excuse me it's very very

143
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it has one</font>

144
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,850
proton and one electron means that the

145
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,670

146
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,680
neutral and very very stable so if you

147
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,810
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it enough energy yet is going to</font>

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,170
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something but it's not like</font>

149
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,320
hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit other stuff and do</font>

150
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:11,170
cool things however deuterium has a

151
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,520
neutron and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its nucleus so the</font>

152
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">combination of the proton and the</font>

153
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,950
neutron hydrogen starts feeling a little

154
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,470
uneasy it's like it's eaten too much or

155
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,570
just totally like binge drink or

156
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:25,990
something and it's unstable and it needs

157
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some mass so deuterium is</font>

158
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:32,890
like an optimal sort of nuclear research

159
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,750
fuel deuterium is to fusion as uranium

160
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,580
or plutonium is to fission it's just

161
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,060
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really great it wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

162
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:44,229
down and deuterium is an isotope of

163
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:47,380
hydrogen so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just sort of basic</font>

164
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,000
diagrams underlying what what happens in

165
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,159
fusion and fission reactions the

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,960
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its fission reactions</font>

167
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,490
usually take something really really big

168
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">like uranium or plutonium and you're</font>

169
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,940
breaking it down into smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> components</font>

170
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,340
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so massive it wants to</font>

171
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,630
break<font color="#CCCCCC"> apart and usually that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be done</font>

172
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,340
by just taking a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> uranium</font>

173
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,669
bombarding it with neutrons and it

174
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,530
starts starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> fissioning and this can</font>

175
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,289
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used as a neutron source to</font>

176
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:13,359
do that sort of thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I'll</font>

177
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very end on how fusion</font>

178
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,470
reactors can improve fission reactors

179
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,800
but fusion you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

180
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:22,750
deuterium or tritium or helium-3 and

181
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,520
since they're small and unstable what

182
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,910
they end up tending to do is want to

183
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,890
clump together to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make bigger things in</font>

184
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,840
the grand scheme of things really really

185
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,760
heavy and massive things want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

186
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,469
lighter until they get stable and really

187
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,539
really light things want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get heavier</font>

188
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,419
until they get stable and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

189
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,009
a tendency of going down this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hill</font>

190
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,748
to a valley made of elements like<font color="#CCCCCC"> led</font>

191
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:47,639
and iron they're very very stable

192
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:49,860
elements perhaps most stable in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,930
universe so if your fusion you're always

194
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,729
getting bigger towards lead or iron if

195
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're fissioning you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always getting</font>

196
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:59,369
smaller to letter iron<font color="#CCCCCC"> until you get to</font>

197
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,139
something stable so you know like if you

198
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:02,909
do a fission reaction you get some

199
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,499
plutonium out it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decay for</font>

200
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,498
billions of years until<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets down to</font>

201
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:09,930
iron this stuff deuterium isn't

202
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:11,490
inherently radioactive it's it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

203
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,559
stable you actually have to put a little

204
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,529
bit of force and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start it</font>

205
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:19,620
along that nuclear pathway so deuterium

206
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,389
will not decay like that however you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

207
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,849
produce things like tritium through the

208
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,979
fusion process that will be inherently

209
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:30,360
radioactive and break down sort of later

210
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,338
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> download line essential</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know this</font>

211
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,440
reactor combines deuterium like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

212
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,139
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are two reaction</font>

213
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,490
pathways in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so about fifty</font>

214
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,440
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time you'll put two</font>

215
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,649
deuterium atoms together and get out

216
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:47,069
tritium and a proton like I said tritium

217
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,560
is another form of hydrogen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

218
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,209
inherently radioactive it's a pretty

219
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,069
cool thing they used to use tritium

220
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,279
everywhere and like exit signs because

221
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:59,189
if you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it inside of a a certain type</font>

222
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,750
of polycarbonate tube the decay of the

223
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,490
tritium would actually produce light

224
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,160
when the particles travel through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,870
tubes<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's so tightly regulated by</font>

226
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,689
the government now that almost no one

227
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,850
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hold of tritium unless you're</font>

228
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,449
at a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy research lab which I</font>

229
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,250
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in my and I'm in my garage so</font>

230
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:19,469
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to get tritium there are</font>

231
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,410
clever hacks for getting tritium however

232
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:25,110
they are very illegal and so the other

233
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,160
pathway is generates helium-3<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

234
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,010
neutron<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

235
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,410
helium-3 is it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most rare</font>

236
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,899
elements right now it's a gas that's

237
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,170
used in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things most importantly</font>

238
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,470
it's used in Neutron detectors and the

239
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">DoD a lot of other federal agencies have</font>

240
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,040
been buying helium-3 detectors like

241
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,989
crazy now because they use them to scan

242
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,790
shipping containers that are coming in

243
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,529
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States for fissile</font>

244
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,300
material and nuclear bombs and stuff

245
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,010
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only is there a</font>

246
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,199
shortage of helium-3 it's usually

247
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,330
produced when

248
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,570
companies or countries will reprocess

249
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,610
spent nuclear waste into plutonium for

250
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,990
bombs thankfully not many people are

251
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:08,280
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anymore so we aren't</font>

252
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,770
producing much<font color="#E5E5E5"> helium-3 these reactors</font>

253
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,220
can actually produce helium-3 to give

254
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,510
you an idea of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> little nuclear stuff</font>

255
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,640
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in one of these</font>

256
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,350
systems you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run one of</font>

257
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">these at steady state for just over a</font>

258
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,400
hundred thousand years to actually have

259
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,040
enough helium 3 in the chamber to be

260
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">detected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by a mass spectrometer or some</font>

261
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that very very sensitive instrument</font>

262
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,170
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to think about yeah you're</font>

263
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,520
making a detector roll over from the

264
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,439
number of counts you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on</font>

265
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,900
an atomic scale you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font>

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know individual atoms and you're</font>

267
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,920
only generating one atom at a time so

268
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,689
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to detect that and it's</font>

269
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,900
very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get from one atom to a</font>

270
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,550
detectable or usable amount of gas the

271
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is is that this could</font>

272
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,089
be a repetitive fuel cycle though if you

273
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,710
had a reactor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was operating at</font>

274
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,630
breakeven efficiency you would be

275
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,610
generating so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> helium-3 and tritium</font>

276
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,380
that those could just be put back into

277
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,570
the plasma and those would be burned as

278
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,430
further fusion fuels almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

279
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,430
fission reactor does with you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjust</font>

280
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,930
the fuel rods into different

281

configurations as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down the</font>

282
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:15,329
decay chain that's one of the really

cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about fusion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reactors so now</font>

285
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,730

recognize a is equal to MC squared

290
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,960
something Einstein was famous for

291
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:37,080
kinetic energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is equal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one-half MV</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">being mass and then electric potential</font>

294
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,030
is equal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a constant times the charge</font>

295

of two things / their distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> from each</font>

296
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,510
other

297
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,550
and when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at a system you</font>

298
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:52,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze it from kinetic energy and</font>

299
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,300
potential energy and in a closed system

300
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,239
those two things should cancel each

301
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,040
other out so when you look at a fusion

302
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,660
system there's a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

303
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,000
kinetic energy that you have to put on

304
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,730
them to overcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> the electric energy</font>

305
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,600
that they're pushing each other apart

306
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,519
everything inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the chamber is</font>

307
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,949
ionized so you have a bunch of positive

308
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,500
stuff floating around and it's just like

309
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two you know north or south poles</font>

310
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,649
of a magnet and trying to push them

311
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,529
together at a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that</font>

312
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,089
electrical charge will force them to not

313
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,680
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in contact with each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other and</font>

314
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:25,019
that's exactly what you want to happen

315
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to get them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually touch</font>

316
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,180
to actually fuse and do all the nuclear

317
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:33,449
cool stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen so</font>

318
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,069
per deuterium eye on it takes actually a

319
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:37,620
pretty small amount of energy to

320
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get that fusion to happen but</font>

321
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,540
this is per<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on so if you were to</font>

322
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:45,870
multiply this out by you know Avogadro's

323
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,000
number which is 10 to the 23 orders of

324
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,949
magnitude this number gets really really

325
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,930
large and so you do have to put in a lot

326
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:59,459
of energy into these systems to actually

327
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:01,709
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most minut amount out however if</font>

328
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,018
you take the the product equation of the

329
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,910
system so if you add up the rest energy

330
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,949
of the deuterium that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in</font>

331
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,709
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> its electric potential and</font>

332
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:12,930
then you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the helium-3 and neutron</font>

333
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,540
produced on the helium-3 side of the

334
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,790
equation these will equal up to this

335
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,839
number which multiplied by Avogadro

336
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:24,269
number is substantially huge joules per

337
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,140
mole is equivalent to watts per second

338
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:30,300
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially generating a very</font>

339
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,850
very large amount of electricity if you

340
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,670
were to actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> molesworth</font>

341
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,160

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">math after that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got on a</font>

343
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,790
math kick last night and I was the key

344
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna put in nuclear physics into</font>

345
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,899
the talk but essentially there are a

346
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:49,360
couple of different ways fusion can work

347
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,129
IEC is what my reactor is sort of

348
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,559
powered off of and what that means is

349
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:54,850
since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bunch of ions floating</font>

350
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,368
around in the chamber and they're all

351
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,259
positively charged it's literally as

352
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,850
simple as putting something negatively

353
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,589
charged in the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chamber and</font>

354
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,720
it will attract all of the positively

355
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,160
charged of stuff so you have a bunch of

356
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,869
ions floating around you put a big

357
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,149
enough voltage in it it's going to suck

358
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,889
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them towards the center and form</font>

359
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,410
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially a star I'll show it</font>

360
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,209
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we also have</font>

361
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">magnetic confinement and inertial</font>

362
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,439
confinement magnetic confinement has

363
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,878
been sort of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news as well as an</font>

364
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,730
ER<font color="#CCCCCC"> shull confinement recently there's a</font>

365
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:27,999
big project in<font color="#CCCCCC"> France called eater which</font>

366
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:30,819
is due to break even in 20-30 meaning

367
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:33,309
that France is planning by 2050 to have

368
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">fusion power plants they want to phase</font>

369
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:37,679
out all fission and have fusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

370
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,059
plants and be entirely fusion-powered

371
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:44,050
problem with eater is that it's like a

372
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:45,670
15 billion dollar experiment and with

373
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,769
the European Union over there they don't

374
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">get much funding rolling in all the time</font>

375
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,240
and they have cutbacks and so it's not

376
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,339
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going very well for them inertial</font>

377
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,889
confinement is actually it seems like

378
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,209
something out of a James Bond<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie we</font>

379
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,129
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> facility in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States</font>

380
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:02,319
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the National Ignition facility or</font>

381
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,230
an if where we have the most powerful

382
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:07,209
laser in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world we shoot it at a tiny</font>

383
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,689
pellet of deuterium which is the fuel in

384
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:13,050
a cylinder made of gold like the purest

385
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:15,699
gold that they can basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> synthesize</font>

386
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,248
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoot the laser at a certain</font>

387
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:21,519
angle that it generates a lattice of

388
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:23,860
x-rays and this lattice of x-rays moves

389
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,170
in to crush the deuterium pellet and put

390
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,350
it in diffusion but the fact that

391
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,479
they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-rays and I lattice</font>

392
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:34,449
configuration always makes me<font color="#CCCCCC"> laugh and</font>

393
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,189
as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> IEC uses electricity and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

394
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:38,049
thing with IEC that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so great is</font>

395
00:15:36,189 --> 00:15:40,929
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a superconducting</font>

396
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,029
magnet like eater uses or magnetic

397
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:44,529
confinement uses you just need a really

398
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:46,600
big power supply which is actually

399
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,429
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to get when I was first</font>

400
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,220
starting off I was like how in the world

401
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:53,920
do I take 120 volts from a house outlet

402
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,870
and get it to 50,000 volts it was like

403
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,248
baffling to me at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time because I was</font>

404
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,810
a junior in<font color="#CCCCCC"> high school and I did not</font>

405
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,880
know anything

406
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,529
a high voltage however when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

407
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,450
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into research it's very easy to</font>

408
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,430
go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a neon sign transformer</font>

409
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,950
off of craigslist and make a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

410
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,420
molta CH multipliers and get up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

411
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,940
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you could be doing fusion</font>

412
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,920
actually at one point I got on

413
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,950
craigslist and found a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was</font>

414
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,779
closing his neon shop and he sold me 40

415
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,540
neon sign transformers for twenty

416
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,130
dollars so i always tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> people when I</font>

417
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,529
do these talks that if anyone's getting

418
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,630
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fusion I have a garage full</font>

419
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:29,580
of neon science transformers that my

420
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,880
parents are you know threatening to

421
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,610
throw away yeah you can use them for

422
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,170
Tesla coils to so email me if you want

423
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,910
neon sign transformers because I have

424
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:44,670
too damn many but basically what happens

425
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,010
is when you suck the ions together with

426
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:49,439
enough electricity you literally get a

427
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,370
massive ions flying around that are

428
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,070
hotter<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the interior of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our Sun</font>

429
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,720
which is really phenomenal to to think

430
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,220
about a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say oh you're not</font>

431
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,600
doing fusion in your garage you have to

432
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,170
be in the millions of degrees and I'm

433
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:08,699
like yes I'm at 103 million degrees

434
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:10,589
Fahrenheit and so it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

435
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,050
this but the very fact that this could

436
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,849
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is due to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> electric field and</font>

437
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,800
the fact that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that much</font>

438
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,958
stuff at that high of a temperature and

439
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,579
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any ions escaping from</font>

440
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,589
that literally if they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just collide</font>

441
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,419
with an air particle they neutralize so

442
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,208
quickly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the temperature</font>

443
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,520
gradient<font color="#CCCCCC"> between them but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things in</font>

444
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:32,000
there are things that you'll see

445
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,470
emitting light the little star inside is

446
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,460
basically hotter than the Sun if it were

447
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:43,110
actually doing fusion so sort of a

448
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,610
schematic of system not unlike mine just

449
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on before I</font>

450
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,580
actually start turning dials and stuff

451
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,070
you have a vacuum<font color="#E5E5E5"> chamber of which I</font>

452
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,379
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> vacuum pumps hooked up to I have</font>

453
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,149
a two-stage mechanical pump which is

454
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,730
what you hear sort of gargling right now

455
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,380
in the background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort</font>

456
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,120
of roughs the chamber it takes out some

457
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,870
of the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it gets it down to a</font>

458
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty low vacuum</font>

459
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not low enough to actually do cool</font>

460
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">nuclear stuff the best analog i usually</font>

461
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,250
give people or analogy is that it's like

462
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,740
taking two cars at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of a runway</font>

463
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,720
and you're told to stick the cars

464
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,000
together but at the same time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

465
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,030
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of motorcycles or our buses going</font>

466
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,160
back and forth across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the runway so</font>

467
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,010
envision the cars as your deuterium and

468
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,660
the buses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the motorcycles as air</font>

469
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,280
particles it's very hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

470
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,990
those cars being able to hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

471
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,700
if you have air in the chamber or

472
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,890
motorcycles or buses going across the

473
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,080
runway so what you do is you remove all

474
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:43,660
the air so you just have the fuel and

475
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,399
it's more likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

476
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,340
called optimizing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cross-section</font>

477
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,900
basically so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that pump and then</font>

478
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,389
I have another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thats hanging off the</font>

479
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,400
side of the cart here and that's called

480
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,780
a oil vapor diffusion pump then

481
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,660
essentially it's got a boiler on the

482
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,720
bottom that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets up to about 220 degrees</font>

483
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,740
Celsius it boils an oil on the inside of

484
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,330
the the system the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oil shoots up and</font>

485
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,820
hits a plate at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of the pump and</font>

486
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,580
since there's no air in the system to

487
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,800
have friction or anything like that the

488
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">vapor streams end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling back down</font>

489
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,730
into the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pump that</font>

490
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">supersonic velocities and that velocity</font>

491
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,240
is high enough to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shift through</font>

492
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,178
the chamber to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of drag out the rest</font>

493
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air so basically with the</font>

494
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:30,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">combination of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these two pumps I can be</font>

495
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,800
zero out any standard vacuum gauge you

496
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,889
have it's it's a really really solid

497
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,870
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out of the whole system it's</font>

498
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,520
probably what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking me the longest to</font>

499
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,620
develop i've spent about two and a half

500
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,320
years just<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on vacuum systems I</font>

501
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,330
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely too much about vacuum now</font>

502
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,189
and it's nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something that I</font>

503
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,439
can set up flip a switch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd all be</font>

504
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">down to vacuum pressure within 15</font>

505
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,360
minutes now but so you have vacuum on

506
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,000
one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side you have</font>

507
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,320
a high voltage<font color="#E5E5E5"> power supply which is the</font>

508
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,140
big crate that's sitting in the middle

509
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,240
of the cart there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

510
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,800
the chamber you have an insulator which

511
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,660
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-voltage feed through it's</font>

512
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,280
basically a glorified<font color="#E5E5E5"> spark plug you</font>

513
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,890
have a big piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ceramic with a</font>

514
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,139
copper piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through it</font>

515
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,260
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what allows you to put the</font>

516
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,940
50,000 volts into the chamber you of

517
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,970
course have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vacuum gauge so you know</font>

518
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:26,170
what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pressure you're at</font>

519
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:29,620
radiation meter duh a neutron detector

520
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:33,430
if you're trying to get neutrons out of

521
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:38,050
the system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a fuel a fuel</font>

522
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:39,460
regulator this is an another engineering

523
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,659
challenge I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have the fuel</font>

524
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,810
on today because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

525
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,000
bombard everyone with neutrons it was

526
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,710
the dosage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this puts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out is not</font>

527
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,890
necessarily anywhere near dangerous

528
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,540
however it's it's very hard to actually

529
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,310
get it to the point where it starts

530
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,930
generating neutrons and it would take

531
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:58,149
much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 30 minutes just to get</font>

532
00:20:55,930 --> 00:21:00,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system stable enough to be you know</font>

533
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had a constant state generating a</font>

534
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,120
nuclear fusion so generally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

535
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:09,010
freaked everyone out with x-rays and

536
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,899
these talks and it's good for a laugh so

537
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,490
when you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all together this is</font>

538
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,760
sort of what you get these are pictures

539
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,770
from my senior science experiment when I

540
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">was still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in high school I did an</font>

experiment called the effects of cathode

composition on inertial electrostatic

543
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,850
confinement fusion reactors there's a

544
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,380
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun I got to go up to North</font>

545
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:29,649
Georgia College and use all of their

546
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,840
labs do my research this is actually a

547
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,130
funny story the first year I did science

548
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,290
fair I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams of going to</font>

549
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,360
international science fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got all the</font>

550
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,520
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to state science fair and ended up</font>

551
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,649
winning grand prize in physics I was the

552
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,150
only grand prize award winner at state

553
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,310
science fair that year to not go to

554
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,710
international science fair I started

555
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,419
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people and one of the judges</font>

556
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,520
came up to me and he said so<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

557
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,840
Neutron detector what are you using

558
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,240
because they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily believe</font>

559
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,879
that I was doing fusion in my garage and

560
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,100
neutrons are the tell-tale sign of the

561
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,190
fusion reaction actually taking process

562
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:06,639
and so I pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boron tin lined</font>

563
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:09,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">neutron detector tube which I had bought</font>

564
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,100
for ten dollars from a nuclear salvage

565
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,650
place called the black hole in Los

566
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,530
Alamos which sadly is out of business

567
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:20,260
now but to give you an idea of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

568
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,180
the tube is it said made for the United

569
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,890
States Atomic Energy Commission on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

570
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,539
tube so it's more of an antique than it

571
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,889
is functional but they said yeah we're

572
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,090
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually generating</font>

573
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:30,369
neutrons whether or not you're doing

574
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,289
what you what you say you are but<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

575
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:34,689
offer to take you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a college lab and</font>

576
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:38,169
do it on calibrated detectors so the

577
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,729
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year I did and my experiment ended</font>

578
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:41,529
up making it international science fair

579
00:22:39,729 --> 00:22:43,479
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good time but these are</font>

580
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:45,549
pictures from that experiment and what I

581
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,809
started noticing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a different</font>

582
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,119
grid than you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see me running today</font>

583
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:50,649
but basically the two metal lines you

584
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,350
see are connected to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

585
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:56,289
rectangular prism type grid made out of

586
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,799
titanium and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the electric</font>

587
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:01,599
charge sits on and in these pictures you

588
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:03,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see the little lines that are</font>

589
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,529
flowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the center of the grid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

590
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,210
that's where all the particles the two

591
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,070
particle beams are colliding and the

592
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,809
center of the grid there however there's

593
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,509
an interesting phenomena occurring you

594
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,999
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> around each of the four lot</font>

595
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,619
wires there are four little<font color="#E5E5E5"> white spots</font>

596
00:23:15,999 --> 00:23:19,239
on the top there much more defined and

597
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:22,238
they are on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom but those are</font>

598
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:23,889
actually pockets of electrons and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

599
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:25,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the grid is heating</font>

600
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:28,119
up so much that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's breaking down at an</font>

601
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:30,488
atomic level and emitting electrons and

602
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,019
so when the particles hit them<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

603
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:35,229
find them into those little circles

604
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:37,239
around the grid but that process of

605
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:40,049
confining is actually constricting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

606
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:42,009
ions and making the whole process

607
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:44,229
inefficient and so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

608
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:46,479
minimize that emission of electrons and

609
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:48,700
my experiment ended up change in the

610
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:51,340
material of the grid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were able to</font>

611
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduce that emission by twenty thousand</font>

612
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,869
percent which was it was a fun

613
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,879
experiment and thankfully it was really

614
00:23:55,869 --> 00:24:00,009
successful but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what's</font>

615
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:01,629
happening is the ions are going in

616
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:05,080
elliptical paths in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

617
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:07,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">Center they they get attracted in and if</font>

618
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,978
they don't they don't collide and fuse

619
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,960
together they<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounce out really quick</font>

620
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:12,549
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as they get sort of to the</font>

621
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,649
exterior of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chamber they start</font>

622
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:16,749
feeling sucked back in again so you got

623
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:18,340
a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just continual flowing in</font>

624
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:20,679
and out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center of the chamber and</font>

625
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,439
it's it's that process that really makes

626
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,999
these reactors so great because even

627
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,099
though there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an efficiency that</font>

628
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:29,649
prevents<font color="#CCCCCC"> them for fusing every time</font>

629
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:32,259
you're recycling your fuel and it's just

630
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:33,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">going back through again so it's a it's</font>

631
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,080
a pretty

632
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,690
it's very simple yet very functional

633
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,429
design now the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these that</font>

634
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,960
will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them never break even as the</font>

635
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,550
fact that you actually have that grid

636
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,290
there because you're exposing that grid

637
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,690
to potentially millions of degrees

638
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,550
Fahrenheit it's breaking down like I

639
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,410
said at an atomic level and every time

640
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it breaks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get things other than</font>

641
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,520
fuel into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plasma so you have</font>

642
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,560
titanium ions and electrons getting in

643
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,810
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's just like the buses</font>

644
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,210
going across the runway it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

645
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,010
destroy the reaction essentially so

646
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,050
that's a problem if you can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

647
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,180
invisible and not break down on an

648
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,300
atomic scale then this would break even

649
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,970
I would be a multi-billionaire we would

650
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:17,120
all be living off of deuterium from

651
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">seawater and our reactors and we would</font>

652
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,889
have no more war and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything would be</font>

653
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,590
great sadly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the case but I'll</font>

654
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,680
do a cool demo so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do</font>

655
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,030
is basically turn on the diffusion pump

656
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll light up a plasma one of my</font>

657
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,960
favorite things to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

658
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is not involving fusion is to</font>

659
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,360
actually observe the change of the

660
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">plasma as it sucks down into vacuum so</font>

661
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,399
I'll let the system go all the way back

662
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to near air will start up a plasma</font>

663
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,840
and watch how it changes as the vacuum

664
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:50,480
pressure decreases and what you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

665
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,060
is that it'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> from like a very</font>

666
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,700
undefined sort of area all the way down

667
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,169
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very defined sort of star will</font>

668
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,870
start to see those beams like the

669
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,790
picture that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had and it'll be pretty</font>

670
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,409
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point we'll get to a</font>

671
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,290
vacuum level where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll have to add more</font>

672
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more voltage will get over 10,000</font>

673
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,500
volts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll start generating x-rays</font>

674
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,080
and I've got the Geiger counter down

675
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:15,320
here now disclaimer I know x rays are

676
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,090
scary however at 10,000 volts this does

677
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,669
not generate a strong enough x-ray to

678
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,699
pierce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stainless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> steel of the</font>

679
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,950
chamber so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only area where x rays</font>

680
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,630
will come out is the glass that's on the

681
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,700
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chamber facing me I'm going</font>

682
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on the other side so whoever</font>

683
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,380
happens to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind this wall may get a</font>

684
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:35,510
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a dose but not much so it</font>

685
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,920
shouldn't hurt them and they won't know

686
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,150
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's all right ignorance</font>

687
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,940
is bliss

688
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,940
so let's let's see if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a star</font>

689
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:53,789
yeah so uh so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fail to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font>

690
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:57,238
this design<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually pioneered by</font>

691
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:59,789
Philo Farnsworth changed over to view

692
00:26:57,239 --> 00:27:03,690
this design<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually pioneered by</font>

693
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:06,389
Philo Farnsworth who is he was the

694
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">inventor of the modern television as we</font>

695
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:12,139
sort of know it he envisioned this

696
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:16,559
design when he was in his teenage years

697
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:17,609
and it's it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> works really well but</font>

698
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,320
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i'm going to do now</font>

699
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:23,519
hopefully this doesn't start feeding

700
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:25,350
back I've turned this valve off so this

701
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,489
is the vacuum gauge and hopefully the

702
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,469
pressure is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

703
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:32,399
bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:35,489
voltage on and we should see some plasma

705
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,029
there so this this is a really cool sort

706
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:41,309
of mode that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plasma gets into and</font>

707
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:43,169
dirt sorry something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's being really</font>

708
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:44,820
researched right now this little beam

709
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:47,489
right here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a bugle jet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

710
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,779
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high density beam of electrons</font>

711
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">I interned at NASA this summer and I was</font>

712
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:57,419
showing a couple of physicists images

713
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,889
that I had taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reactor and so</font>

714
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:00,419
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking me questions just sort of</font>

715
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,769
testing my knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you know</font>

716
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,419
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I said yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a high</font>

717
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:05,789
density stream of electrons is called a

718
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,169
bugle jet and they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly we're</font>

719
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:08,669
researching this right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

720
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,340
advanced propulsion division because

721
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:13,499
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of dense stream of</font>

722
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,590
electrons that will provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very high</font>

723
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:18,239
impulse and electronic space thruster so

724
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,689
it's this type of discharge that's

725
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:24,109
actually being explored by NASA and a

726
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:27,090
couple of other interstellar flight

727
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:29,279
divisions and research labs for

728
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,009
propelling spacecraft with electrical

729
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:35,190
systems now NASA is actually working

730
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:38,100
with a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a MC squared that</font>

731
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">was started by a guy who originated with</font>

732
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,840
this type of fusion research and they're

733
00:28:41,009 --> 00:28:44,549
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a fusion reactor that</font>

734
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,039
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually draw these streams of</font>

735
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:49,529
electrons off of so the fusion reactor

736
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,809
will both provide electricity to power

737
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:53,820
the spacecraft as well as have these

738
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:55,799
electron streams jetting out the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

739
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,760
it that will propel the aircraft I mean

740
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,620
the spacecraft forward

741
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,240
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great because once you</font>

742
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:03,370
start going there isn't any really

743
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,220
friction in space to stop you and these

744
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,449
drives could potentially get up to the

745
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:10,780
point where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could drive us very</font>

746
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,520
near light speed is there any way we can

747
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the lights off it'll look much much</font>

748
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:20,940
better and more clear we're getting a

749
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:24,340
little bit of reflection darn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

750
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,630
this is where it should get exciting i'm

751
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,129
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the valve and the vacuum</font>

752
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,590
pressure will start to drop and we

753
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,630
should see some changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it</font>

754
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,330
looks at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

755
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,710
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and turn the the Geiger counter on</font>

756
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:39,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand to the other side</font>

757
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the as the as</font>

758
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,090
the discharge changes another cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

759
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,130
you'll start to see is white dots on the

760
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,929
camera screen that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

761
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,540
high energy gamma rays hitting the

762
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,820
camera sensor and since the camera

763
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,379
sensor is not 100% chemically pure it

764
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,419
has some phosphors and things like that

765
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,090
in it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phosphorus in the camera sins</font>

766
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,500
are actually scintillating producing

767
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:07,030
light because they're hit by high-energy

768
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">photons and discern the the research</font>

769
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:13,930
agency that has the LHC has recently

770
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,440
built a out of actually the same cameras

771
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:19,960
that are used in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iphone iphone 4gs</font>

772
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:22,030
or a 4s because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that those</font>

773
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,290
sensors<font color="#CCCCCC"> are particularly chemically in</font>

774
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,020
pure and they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great to</font>

775
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,000
responding to<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-energy photons so</font>

776
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,830
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually using a sensor sort of</font>

777
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,450
like that at the LHC right now which is

778
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting as well</font>

779
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:39,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn on the high</font>

780
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,260
vacuum pump as well but i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

781
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:43,260
the microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for one second</font>

782
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,500
fun

783
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:01,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">told you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody yeah well it's so</font>

784
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,800
the thing is is in a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

785
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,840
spacecraft you would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus</font>

786
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,210
this and these are really easily focused

787
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,010
since the electrons<font color="#CCCCCC"> are charged you can</font>

788
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,290
focus them with electrostatic or

789
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,780
magnetic field which would be really

790
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,450
really easy to do so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

791
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concern for in terms of if</font>

792
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,050
they've ever be poignant someone you

793
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,260
wouldn't want this to be pointing at the

794
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:25,330
glass because it's in fact very very hot

795
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,270
so that part of the chamber may get

796
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,010
red-hot at the firework to let this run

797
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,170
for five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten minutes just because of</font>

798
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:34,750
how hot they are however the chamber is

799
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,890
grounded so at some point the electrons

800
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

801
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:44,630
deflection from the chamber since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

802
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:46,580
grounded they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to microphone what</font>

803
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,700
oh yeah sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should have picked this</font>

804
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,730
up they will deflect a little bit from

805
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the chamber so it doesn't get that hot</font>

806
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:58,070
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very rare this that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

807
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,900
ever be pointed to a person the thing

808
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,120
that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry about is if</font>

809
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,130
these electrons were at a high enough

810
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,689
speed which they're not right now you

811
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,360
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually design a system</font>

812
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:10,010
particularly to do this you could chew

813
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,719
them up to a high enough speed and then

814
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,910
hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on metal and you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

815
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,440
producing quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of x-rays but we</font>

816
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,380
aren't at that voltage yet to actually

817
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,270
do that and as we get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> voltage to</font>

818
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,580
do that since you're focusing everything

819
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,620
more and more you lose this bugle jet

820
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,030
and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on</font>

821
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:31,689
high vacuum pump and hopefully that will

822
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:31,690
happen see the bloody bit there

823
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,800
Oh

824
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,910
alright so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just asked where this</font>

825
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:52,500
happening right now and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the</font>

826
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,660
white thing from the top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chamber</font>

827
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-voltage feed through</font>

828
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,220
there's a rod going through that into

829
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,169
the sort of center of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this vacuum</font>

830
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,780
chamber at the top here and the grid is

831
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:08,280
inside of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so our vacuum</font>

832
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:11,790
pressure is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to plumb it a little</font>

833
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,320
bit right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at like three</font>

834
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,710
kilovolts so we're barely putting any

835
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,080
power into this thing but as the vacuum

836
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:20,610
pressure goes down basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

837
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,770
happening is you're having to put more

838
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,899
and more electricity in because there's

839
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,120
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough not much stuff to carry</font>

840
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,390
current inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chamber so you're</font>

841
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,159
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use more voltage and as it</font>

842
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:34,230
drops i'll put more voltage on and then

843
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,360
we should see the Geiger counter start

844
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,860
counting it's not really biased properly

845
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,740
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so don't freak out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

846
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,080
actually counting but we should see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

847
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,930
different in difference in counts as

848
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,010
soon as the x-rays start to roll out it

849
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,010
will be very noticeable

850
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,490
so so probably when we start generating

851
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:04,810
x-rays that that count will will scale

852
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:07,340
over many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute so that's</font>

853
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,810
yeah if you didn't see the talk

854
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,270
introduction it's a it's a bring your

855
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:14,690
own let shielding talk so I hope you all

856
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">took care of that harder as years go on</font>

857
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:24,050
to die no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no III have a I have a lead</font>

858
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,270
under shielding awesome now I actually

859
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,240
don't run this quite quite that often

860
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,159
mainly because tech sector sucks all of

861
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,620
the wife out of me and I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like no</font>

862
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">time for nuclear research anymore just</font>

863
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,100
coding

864
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,808
yeah it just sort of weirds people out

865
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:42,940
so I try to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from it I started</font>

866
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:47,099
glowing at one point and my friends were

867
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,099
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> man this is weird you need to stop</font>

868
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,559
girlfriend<font color="#CCCCCC"> love to get two dicks it's an</font>

869
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:56,159
introduction it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice party</font>

870
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:56,159
icebreaker

871
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,160
so and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when I when I</font>

872
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,899
was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research experiments where</font>

873
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,960
I'm generating very very high fluxes of

874
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,450
neutrons will do the will do the reactor

875
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,460
impulses so it'll be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 30 second</font>

876
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,779
pulse and that helps you standardize the

877
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,630
voltage and stuff you're putting into

878
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:18,940
the chamber but also it's it's less data

879
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,620
since you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like six to</font>

880
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,810
eight variables you know vacuum pressure

881
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,660
current voltage you have to keep your

882
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:27,700
runs very short else you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have you</font>

883
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,790
know tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data that's just very very</font>

884
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:35,500
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out there</font>

885
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:38,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we don't eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> children I'm not</font>

886
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">using them anyway</font>

887
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,529
alright so pressure is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to</font>

888
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,540
drop here we've got we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a little</font>

889
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,660
bit of rise in pressure because when the

890
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:56,470
oil starts to boil it<font color="#CCCCCC"> boils off the</font>

891
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">water vapor so we'll start to hear a</font>

892
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,890
ticking noise and a couple of seconds I

893
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,420
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to hear it and that's</font>

894
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,279
basically the oil coming down and

895
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,950
hitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the walls once that ticking</font>

896
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,070
sound happens the pressure is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

897
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:11,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">to drop like a stone probably what will</font>

898
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:15,640
happen is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will get very bright the</font>

899
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:17,800
x-rays<font color="#E5E5E5"> will will fly up and I'll have to</font>

900
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">scramble to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side to adjust the</font>

901
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">vacuum pump back down so we can actually</font>

902
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:26,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep a plasma in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the chamber and again</font>

903
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:29,260
this is all stainless<font color="#E5E5E5"> steel back here so</font>

904
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:30,970
there's no x rays coming this way mainly

905
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,030
just towards the camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have I call</font>

906
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:38,339
the camera the gamma cam it's it's the

907
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sacrificial piece of the whole system</font>

908
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GAM camera the the other cool thing</font>

909
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular is that</font>

910
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:52,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can set my power supply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to about fifty</font>

911
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:55,710
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is you know 25,000 volts</font>

912
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:57,809
and once it gets down to pressure where

913
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,670
the high vacuum pump is running I can

914
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:01,470
just turn the knob on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of the</font>

915
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,509
high vacuum pump and regulate it to the

916
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,490
pressure I want it to be at and the

917
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:08,190
voltage and amperage will correspond to

918
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,680
that pressure basically it's sort of

919
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:13,049
self regulates to a point just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

920
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of how everything is sort of working</font>

921
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:19,319
inside with the an internal the voltage

922
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,269
and current that the plasma is actually

923
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:23,519
carrying itself the plasma is actually

924
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,319
charged<font color="#CCCCCC"> in digital data that you've got</font>

925
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,689
a monitor behind you that's reflecting

926
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:35,069
all that feedback out here not

927
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:38,910
necessarily most of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

928
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:41,160
you're done there there's there's pretty

929
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,930
much no backscattering with these types

930
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,660
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these this type of x-ray is called</font>

931
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,359
bremsstrahlung x-ray it's a very very

932
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,160
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> weak x-ray that's why it doesn't</font>

933
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,328
come through the stainless steel<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

934
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,950
with basically glass and paper like very

935
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:59,640
sparse materials anything didn't is

936
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:01,649
going to scatter them or break them up

937
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,618
and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

938
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:07,140
inverse square<font color="#CCCCCC"> law on your side so the</font>

939
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">farther you are away from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the less of</font>

940
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,578
the dosage you're getting right of the

941
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,580
worth it I'm on this side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its I'm all</font>

942
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,920
right

943
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,580
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> dad so it's starting to drop a</font>

944
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,580
little now

945
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:30,770
haha cancer april fools all you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

946
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:35,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so our pressure is starting to</font>

947
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:37,550
drop I'll watch the voltage and when I

948
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,350
see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 k i'll direct all of you</font>

949
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,820
does anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to volunteer to hold</font>

950
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:46,670
the Geiger counter up so we can all see

951
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:48,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the count all right it's a 250 in</font>

952
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:53,200
climbing think that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> well oh holy</font>

953
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:56,870
shit 381<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there are we go</font>

954
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,870
wait wait I gotta adjust the vacuum

955
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:10,420
pressure well I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your video but</font>

956
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:10,420
you can wholly shit

957
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,680
sorry this is where it becomes kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

958
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,870
hands-on when it starts getting really

959
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,000
high voltage but basically you can see

960
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,650
now that the plasma is much more focused

961
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,930
we have that one beam coming out of the

962
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,180
right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's much brighter in</font>

963
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,710
that smaller area meaning that it's

964
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,899
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be doing</font>

965
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,150
that that little<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball of light in the</font>

966
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:51,780
center if we had fuel in here would

967
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,780
basically be a star is it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> me right</font>

968
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">expand rip funny side</font>

969
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:12,189
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say uh and let down the mic and</font>

970
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:16,390
run out the room that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

971
00:40:12,189 --> 00:40:21,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably run to that right there is</font>

972
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:27,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">startled up a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah thank you</font>

973
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:33,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see that it's a very expensive demo</font>

974
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:35,919
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is going up fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

975
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:39,249
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at 15,000 volts it's</font>

976
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:40,989
pretty stable but I saw a couple of

977
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:45,988
white dots on the camera display at

978
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:48,699
first but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are now</font>

979
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:50,769
that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> No did you see those white</font>

980
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:53,329
dots yeah

981
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:57,709
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard to sort of manage the</font>

982
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:59,180
height not yet still working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot</font>

983
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bring the flux capacitor for the</font>

984
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,109
black hole so hey the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geiger counter</font>

985
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:05,359
will do that next year or something

986
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:08,558
we'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dragoncon that will be</font>

987
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,558
exciting in front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those people</font>

988
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:17,240
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we be oh I wouldn't stay in the</font>

989
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:19,819
car probably that really ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

990
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,189
so we're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on 10k again it</font>

991
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:25,099
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be picking up again soon come</font>

992
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:32,529
back up again really fast yeah we go I

993
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:35,260
think the feed froze again these days

994
00:41:32,529 --> 00:41:39,190
that's it still like

995
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:41,920
okay another paper it's over 200 ago how

996
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,960
and so to give you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of just how</font>

997
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,670
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> radiation should always be</font>

998
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,980
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously but to give you an idea</font>

999
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,350
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how low of a dose even with this</font>

1000
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,880
amount of x-rays pouring out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it when</font>

1001
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was doing my research at North Georgia</font>

1002
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,900
College the professor several times

1003
00:41:54,430 --> 00:42:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">during the run would just move the</font>

1004
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:09,850
camera and look straight in it so that's

1005
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:12,100
why yeah probably but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always like you</font>

1006
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,020
know having more safety precautions than

1007
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:18,580
necessary and this is certainly observed

1008
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:24,220
with the gamma cam but watch my job feel

1009
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:26,110
funny person is it a black power they're

1010
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,430
all right the the wall is dense enough

1011
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:33,850
to to stop an answer about 300,000 and

1012
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:37,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">Counting and whatever that is</font>

1013
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:40,529
disconcerting it counts up disciplines

1014
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:43,870
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this yet</font>

1015
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:47,260
this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been on an airplane actually in</font>

1016
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:49,330
a steel briefcase I flew it to LA for

1017
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> International Science Fair I carried</font>

1018
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:54,700
it on the airplane verbs but you can

1019
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a fusion no I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would have</font>

1020
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,910
freaked them out a little bit too much

1021
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,340
yeah when I go through TSA this is a

1022
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:03,190
research vacuum chamber that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

1023
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:06,010
is just not specifically what it's

1024
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,260
researched so pray they understand

1025
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,580
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are ya so you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> telling me</font>

1026
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:13,170
I can't have nail clippers but you can

1027
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,170
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fusion reactor on a wife yeah</font>

1028
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:20,490
those nail clippers can hurt someone you

1029
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,189
would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be surprised what you can</font>

1030
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:35,330
take on planes you know uranium is just

1031
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:35,330
fossils know something you ate devices

1032
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,710
my hair's as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the mo the</font>

1033
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">most trouble I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had with anything has</font>

1034
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:48,390
been a vacuum valve they like really

1035
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:51,440
really freaked out a valve this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1036
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,440
good sign everyone run

1037
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:15,250
yeah but that's that's the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1038
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:19,960
we haven't tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet quite possibly</font>

1039
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:21,970
though last last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dragoncon we</font>

1040
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,900
tried to convince Stanley to sit nets to

1041
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,569
it to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> give Stanley superpowers</font>

1042
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,829
he didn't come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk though so</font>

1043
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:38,650
that was kind of upsetting maybe this

1044
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:40,599
year are you sure yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1045
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight-counts what it's like out there</font>

1046
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,630
you guys but everything's going this way

1047
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,630
is so very fun

1048
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:04,190
with you so that's a that's a brief

1049
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:04,190
overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fusion for you thank you</font>

1050
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I think that's an</font>

1051
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,828
excellent transition I'll finish up as

1052
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,720
quick as I can so basically back in the

1053
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,329
day the first particle accelerators ever

1054
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,549
ever made where these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things called</font>

1055
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:28,770
cyclotrons so traditionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> particle</font>

1056
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,900
accelerators are called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux linear</font>

1057
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,770
particle accelerators and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're big</font>

1058
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,809
tubes and the principle is you apply

1059
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,150
electrical current at regular intervals

1060
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:41,670
down the tube and every time you apply

1061
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:44,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> electric current you accelerate the</font>

1062
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,770
particles that much more so as you're

1063
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:50,880
going down the tube they accelerate more

1064
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:52,710
and so very<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly the limitation of</font>

1065
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">the system becomes how long your tube</font>

1066
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:59,910
can be yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like every system</font>

1067
00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:01,920
however there were some clever physicist

1068
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,190
who said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

1069
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,250
tube circular and<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what they</font>

1070
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:11,220
came up with was what a cyclotron in

1071
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">physics we know that magnetic fields can</font>

1072
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,930
basically been to the path of a particle

1073
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,430
so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having electric field</font>

1074
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,680
that's just shooting a particle straight

1075
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,899
you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that electric field in the</font>

1076
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of two really really strong</font>

1077
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,160
magnets I mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> super strong magnets</font>

1078
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:30,329
and it gets the particle to go in

1079
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,759
circles so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I of</font>

1080
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,210
this diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> the LHC is technically a</font>

1081
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,730
linear accelerator it's just in a circle

1082
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,799
so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cyclotron and the</font>

1083
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,559
fact that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can bring the beams over</font>

1084
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:47,359
the same course over and over again but

1085
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:49,710
it's not technically a cyclotron

1086
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,750
basically you have this chamber maid of

1087
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,030
non-magnetic material in between two

1088
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:57,960
magnets and you have an electrical field

1089
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:59,549
that goes at opposite polarities it's a

1090
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,010
square wave basically just oscillates

1091
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:03,509
back and forth in between two plates and

1092
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,250
so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a positive particle that</font>

1093
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,070
gets sucked back and forth these two

1094
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:07,720
plates

1095
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,630
at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the particle is</font>

1096
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">travelling in a spiral path towards the</font>

1097
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,020
outside of the chamber it starts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1098
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,970
center and<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes towards the outside the</font>

1099
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,490
strength of your magnetic field is what

1100
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,890
determines how many of laps you can go

1101
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:24,520
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the circle before the particle</font>

1102
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,930
exits the chamber so these are generally

1103
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:28,480
made with really really strong

1104
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:31,690
electromagnets in the range of like

1105
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,790
point 8 22 Tesla's and that's basically

1106
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:37,720
about the same strength of your average

1107
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:40,000
MRI so getting that sort of magnet as an

1108
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:43,720
amateur is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard and they take</font>

1109
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,610
a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of electricity so there's</font>

1110
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,160
been a couple of people on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

1111
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:49,990
I think I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth now to start</font>

1112
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,569
designing what we're calling micro

1113
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,759
cyclotrons and essentially the principle

1114
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,830
is since neodymium permanent magnets

1115
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,260
have gotten so strong now you can

1116
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:01,900
basically for three hundred dollars by

1117
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,790
two magnets with a they each have a pool

1118
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,230
force of about five hundred and fifty

1119
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">pounds meaning that you can pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

1120
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:11,080
550-pound object with one of them and

1121
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,930
you you put them inside of a little

1122
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">metal piece it's called a yoke sort of</font>

1123
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,790
like a sort of like a transformer yoke

1124
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,330
and so you sandwich these neodymium

1125
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:24,880
magnets and and you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1126
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:27,790
magnetic field at the range<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need it</font>

1127
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,860
to be it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small so the</font>

1128
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:32,290
whole challenge then becomes getting the

1129
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,750
chamber that small and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then having a</font>

1130
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,970
very very high frequency and high power

1131
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:40,630
RF circuit to actually oscillate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1132
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:42,520
particles back and forth fast enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1133
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:44,860
right now i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on cad drawings to</font>

1134
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,870
build the cyclotron and hopefully this

1135
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,520
is what i will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be presenting all</font>

1136
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:51,250
of my designs and some of the maths

1137
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,530
behind the cyclotron at<font color="#CCCCCC"> DragonCon and</font>

1138
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,720
maybe even a demo but like i said the

1139
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,340
end goal of this project is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1140
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,040
particle<font color="#E5E5E5"> accelerator that you could put</font>

1141
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,780
in a backpack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can pull out set</font>

1142
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,950
on a table hook it up to your vacuum

1143
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:09,530
systems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> high voltage</font>

1144
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:18,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">though and generate antimatter so it</font>

1145
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:26,480
should be interesting so uh any

1146
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:29,450
questions thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so much baby yeah I</font>

1147
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">am in the electric bill go really high</font>

1148
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:34,720
you're on des what the fuck out actually

1149
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,099
the computer is with my computer

1150
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,290
probably takes up more wattage than the

1151
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,119
reactor does actually so and I was

1152
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:48,430
building a phase-change cooling system

1153
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:51,440
from my computer at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so yet like</font>

1154
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:53,750
yeah you had the 800 watt computer with

1155
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase change cooling system with two</font>

1156
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,770
compressors in it so that really took up

1157
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> electricity bill much more than the</font>

1158
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:03,980
reactor did just sort of snuck the

1159
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:05,540
reactor and and yeah and so far the

1160
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,640
reactor hasn't taken much toll in the

1161
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:12,190
neighborhood I have blown the substation

1162
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:15,828
in my col de sac once but we were it was

1163
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:18,250
that was an interesting night<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kristen</font>

1164
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:18,250
said my

1165
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:25,270
but it's been it's been a really fun and

1166
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,470
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always really enjoy giving talks to</font>

1167
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:31,750
people because like I said nuclear

1168
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:34,598
anything is really subject to public

1169
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,309
opinion these days and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like not a</font>

1170
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,829
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public has the chance to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1171
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:41,410
what good nuclear can do and you know

1172
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:44,950
words about nuclear other than meltdown

1173
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:47,379
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Noble and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fukushima so I urge you</font>

1174
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:49,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another look at nuclear energy</font>

1175
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:51,369
because you know especially as computer

1176
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:54,250
security people and computer scientist

1177
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:56,589
or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever you are you can</font>

1178
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,049
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> see our need for for energy</font>

1179
00:50:56,589 --> 00:51:00,549
these days and I think nuclear is going

1180
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:01,930
to be what really propels us into the

1181
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:11,890
future but thank you so much has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1182
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:14,910
quite an honor to speak today and who

1183
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,910
couldn't use a third nipple
