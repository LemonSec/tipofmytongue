34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,239
thing i was in her pushing I realized oh

35

37
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,400
is

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,520
alrighty then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we're starting ah</font>

39
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,550
 it looks low my weird what editing

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,660
imposed tells that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adrian there might be</font>

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,790
three or four things you need to edit

42
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,829
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this video I'm just kidding no</font>

43
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,160
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how he does it not that of</font>

44
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,870
it yeah I've ever added in anything out

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,030
i've ever said on stage I'm sure that's

46
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,070
much the chagrin of my employer or

47
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,200
desperately found Adrian after Scott up

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,010
unless you're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android token that uh</font>

guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah for trivia who's the</font>

51
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:25,459
handsome<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy oh goodness so the picture</font>

52
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:29,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes from hey Joey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and still feedback</font>

53
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:32,959
the picture comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carolina con I'm</font>

54
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,390
apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my old age doing stupid</font>

55
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,990
<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we were printing fake</font>

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:43,339
Microsoft IDs I made a phone call and

57
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:46,820
ask for some sample Microsoft IDs and I

58
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,870
got photographs of live microsoft IDs

59
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:54,410
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then recreated in fireworks and</font>

60
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,830
then proceeded to print ID badges for

61
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,750
half the people at Carolina con and they

62
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,390
looked identical to a real Microsoft

63
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:04,640
Magi no because a Microsoft employee

64
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,119
pulled hers out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> her bag and it was</font>

65
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,649
color matched in everything some waiting

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,140
for that phone call sometime soon this

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:18,349
happened to be the picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was on</font>

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:22,650
no was<font color="#CCCCCC"> no his badge so so anyway</font>

69
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:26,849
this year of the theme is improved

70
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,349
signal-to-noise ratio girly drinks drink

71
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,169
early drink so what Chuck signed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:36,180
crisp version thank you very much shut

73
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:37,919
up so a lot of the times the<font color="#E5E5E5"> themes are</font>

74
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,060
based on my life or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar so</font>

75
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,229
whatever's going on at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time I</font>

76
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,940
typically have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

77
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,469
i'm the the hardest working man in show

78
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,719
business<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think but I could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

79
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,500
completely wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the things</font>

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,620
that my theme for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year has been</font>

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,630
improving my signal to noise ratio a lot

82
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">of times those seams are spur of the</font>

83
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:03,060
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm driving along and talking to</font>

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,699
Robin on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone it's like you know</font>

85
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,229
what do you think we know about this and

86
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,030
that and then all of a sudden boom

87
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,949
there's the theme there you know there's

88
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,568
the tag line it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it's like</font>

89
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:15,330
that's perfect didn't you literally

90
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,639
record a video for the website one year

91
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,099
while you were driving to work like yeah

92
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,419
yeah I did I didn't for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wi-Fi rides a</font>

93
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,099
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff and stick it up in the</font>

94
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,380
corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it which</font>

95
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:28,199
yeah that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually cool and</font>

96
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,319
I want guard that's lazy but it

97
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,529
worked in a lot of cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're inside</font>

98
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,840
jokes I could if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were sitting around</font>

99
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:38,639
drunk looking at memorabilia I can go

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,429
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and show you inside jokes that only</font>

101
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,319
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us ever got some of them you're</font>

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,750
actually wearing from time to time and

103
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:50,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have no idea but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an absolute</font>

104
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,069
hoot so if you speak out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get Joey</font>

105
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,380
Turner and smack<font color="#CCCCCC"> the out of him</font>

106
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:58,919
you're 18 it is almost birthday which is

107
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,330
almost birthday halfway smack the

108
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,859
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> him if he makes a comment every</font>

109
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,508
time I say something so the

110
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,270
signal-to-noise ratio here's actually

111
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the formula for it I did have the</font>

112
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,590
Wikipedia definition of what it was but

113
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,138
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was dry and boring words ever now</font>

114
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,650
yeah this was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now my favorite</font>

115
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture of</font>

116
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,190
I think I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on every</font>

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,250
idea I ever make for anyone i think it's

118
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so a signal to noise ratio is the</font>

119
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure used in science and engineering</font>

120
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,199
that compares the level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desired</font>

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,479
signal into the level of background

122
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,509
noise it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is defined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the radio to</font>

123
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,669
signal power of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise power a ratio</font>

124
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,949
higher than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 to 1 indicates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more single</font>

125
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,960
than noise while snr is commonly quoted

126
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,000
for electrical signals it can be applied

127
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,049
to any form of signal that's

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,800
boring so anyway essentially the signal

129
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,449
noise ratio is from my standpoint is how

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,570
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I getting done as opposed to how</font>

131
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:03,669
much static is around me so I have a lot

132
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:06,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things that I end up</font>

133
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:08,080
getting into I'm involved in a maker

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,580
faire in Nashville is actually two of

135
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,229
them this year I'm on the Nashville

136
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,760
Technology Council all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

137
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,639
are going on and what I've found is

138
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,500
every day<font color="#CCCCCC"> every night for lunch for</font>

139
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,509
dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a google hangout I'm</font>

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,240
at some user meeting I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a meeting</font>

141
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,470
of user meetings that you know literally

142
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,789
it's just one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things where I'm</font>

143
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,830
sitting in the corner playing with my

144
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,349
laptop going are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really talking about</font>

145
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,889
code of conduct for the Java users group

146
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

147
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:44,610
so the signal-to-noise ratio is you're

148
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:46,650
trying to raise the way oh man don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

149
00:07:44,610 --> 00:08:02,450
that around him cuz ill go apeshit I'm

150
00:07:46,650 --> 00:08:05,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's bad it's really bad yeah so the</font>

151
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:08,060
basic issue for me is is raising the

152
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,469
signal lowering the noise less

153
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,660
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff going on and actually</font>

154
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,580
getting a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things done fortunately</font>

155
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,770
it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have looked like it but for</font>

156
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,210
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to go a lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

157
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:20,729
things done for outer zone way ahead of

158
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,120
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact i was able to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font>

159
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,590
I was yeah it actually do a lot longer

160
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,760
than that but it didn't look like that

161
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:35,699
from the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the</font>

162
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:37,140
the general thing was you know focus on

163
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,640
where you want to go i know i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

164
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,569
clear vision of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

working<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards ahead 42</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm figuring</font>

166
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,750
that out now which is kind of funny all

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,950
the younger guys out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

168
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,720

of the head with a vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know with a</font>

something

is pinned up

178
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,579
for us it was but anyway pick a path the

179
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:16,670
direction we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go what you're</font>

doing that make you happy not exactly

183
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:26,240
the ones that pay the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most money</font>

184
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:27,980
although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does buy a house a lot</font>

185
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,309
easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that happiness doesn't go</font>

186
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,429
well in the mortgage but do what you do

187
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:38,269
what you enjoy definitely do what you're

188
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:41,779
passionate about if you can don't look

193
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,729
it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know spend the time do what</font>

194
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:57,559
you've got to do you don't have to be

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but be one of the best in</font>

196
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,969
your field you don't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't take a</font>

197
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,189
whole lot to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject matter expert</font>

198
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,779
on a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to</font>

199
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,929
spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time and play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around with</font>

200
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,069
them so I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the book but</font>

201
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:13,129
sometimes it's better it's breaking

202
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:15,128
something I have a long history of

203
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:18,110
totally equipment up

204
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:20,299
understanding oh man I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have dead</font>

205
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,249
short of that fuse oops I have a 13-inch

206
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:24,470
macbook pro that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead because I went</font>

207
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:26,360
well if that display works and click

208
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,559
boom and smoke came out like

209
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,920
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 hundred dollars down the</font>

210
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:33,189
drain but I learned don't touch that

211
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,569
fuse

212
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,980
so it was familiar with formula 409

213
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,110
who's ever cleaned anything yo this is

214
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,310
scary your hand there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

215
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:53,420
women here raise your hand you've

216
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:57,849
cleaned something formula 409 does

217
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,849
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why it's called formula 409</font>

218
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,820
correct 408 formulas before it failed

219
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,699
they didn't achieve what they wanted

220
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,950
number 409 was the one that did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,580
trick so that became the name for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

222
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:17,510
actual product so some guys and a lab

223
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,250
somewhere up<font color="#CCCCCC"> 408 times how many</font>

224
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">times have you up a piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

225
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,680
and been disgusted with yourself there's

226
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:27,020
408 in these these guys that they've SAT

227
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,430
there over day after day it doesn't

228
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,010
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't work that doesn't work</font>

229
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:33,050
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 49 made it they were</font>

230
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,689
persistent and they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with</font>

231
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go on google and</font>

232
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,870
google for that there's like 20 to 25

233
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,870
different products based on that formula

234
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,870
yes

235
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,040
you know what well you pull out your

236
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,800
 phone and figure it out you shut

237
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,740
up during the process yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">nevermind i give up and the wd-40 guys</font>

240
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,110
them but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard is it to lubricate</font>

241
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:09,660
something as compared to clean something

242
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,510
which is a personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dougie</font>

243
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,260
crazy how hard is it deliberate 87 as

244
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,260
compared to clean

245
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:40,360
so so we've got the way oh you don't

and you know you signed a board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

285
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,719
just hung out and had a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> time well</font>

286
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,990
little did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

287
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,440
fight it was scary

288
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in hung out some of the</font>

289
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,670
speakers that spoke at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Interzone</font>

290
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually came to our conference and hung</font>

291
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:31,860
out and talked there so it was kind of

292
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,560
bizarre to have a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference where</font>

293
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,120
it was a hundred bucks a head to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

294
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,010
for people to show up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hotel room</font>

295
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,240
and crammed into this hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> room I don't</font>

296
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,470
know how we didn't get oxygen

297
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,230
deprivation well maybe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was why I</font>

298
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,230
was so fun to research that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

299
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:52,410
we were we were up so it

300
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,599
literally started out as a couple of

301
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,420
hotel rooms as time went on I actually

302
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,490
had to rent some hotel space you know

303
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,219
like the boardroom or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

304
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:05,339
the conference area and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

305
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,529
having the organ of the hotel come to me

306
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,600
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you need to pay the</font>

307
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,339
bill now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tipping the don't of the</font>

308
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,050
donation canister up and pulling cash

309
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,120
out until I got enough to pay the tab

310
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,109
and it was really shitty because it was

311
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,970
getting down to the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

312
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I was like oh man we might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

313
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,760
trouble so it grew out of that and

314
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,709
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> really enjoyed it and the crazy</font>

315
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,200
part was the demand that I keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

316
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:29,699
every year acid I don't know if I we

317
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,110
shouldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is yeah it's just a</font>

318
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,480
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun it was like now did you you</font>

319
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,459
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it so now this is the ninth</font>

320
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,930
year so apparently I'm either a pushover

321
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:42,000
or everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kick with it so</font>

322
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,250
in little<font color="#E5E5E5"> gate al al</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stroger demanded</font>

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,230
always be donation-based so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

324
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,680
that conversation every couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

325
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,649
sitting around sitting around discussing

326
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,020
it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like look dude it's got to</font>

327
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,720
be donation-based oh man you know this

328
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,520
it's a certain uncertainty if I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

329
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">Scott molten us it's God we're going to</font>

in advance and we did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

374
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,030
advertising we wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in</font>

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hotel you know right now we're</font>

381
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,000
sweating to death so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a lot</font>

382

more people show up it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be the</font>

383
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">same it wouldn't be small and it's bent</font>

384
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,360
and comfortable we'd have people coming

385
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:59,889
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our ears so we always kind of</font>

386
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">shut</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the notice short yeah it is the</font>

387
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:05,200
website details yeah it's a feature

388
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:10,090
absolutely I'm not done with that you

389
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">can drink that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever so how</font>

390
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:13,000
to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website deviant was</font>

391
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,639
supposed to sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do the website</font>

392
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,470
for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> varlet</font>

393
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,270
part of the problem behind that is

394
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,890
deviant because I'm goes I am ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

395
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,020
the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in like the middle</font>

396
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,280
of six different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and I</font>

397
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,910
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the time to set everything</font>

398
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,670
up to allow him to do that that deviant

399
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,710
is also a very busy person so when his

400
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:34,770
window was closed you know what do you

401
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,630
do so yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason the website isn't</font>

402
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:38,400
very flamboyant and wonderful it's

403
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:41,460
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do websites and I don't</font>

404
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,850
do graphics really not for websites so

405
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:49,260
how do I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out when it will be well</font>

406
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:50,699
ask somebody email me text me check

407
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter because actually that's probably</font>

408
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,890
where we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the majority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

409
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">information for what was going on so</font>

410
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,010
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mailing list out there</font>

411
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,640
if I remember where to get on i'll

412
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:05,430
actually find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and post that but the</font>

413
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,390
next year don't want everybody to show

414
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:11,670
up so we get to that why outer zone well

415
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:15,000
I keep asking myself that question all

416
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:19,460
the time other than I just enjoy you

417

419
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,570
really is keep it small you know we've

420
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,980
always touted outer zone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

421
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,110
conference you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to and do a shot</font>

424
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:39,330
to DEFCON with somebody and then never

425
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,340
see them the rest of the weekend unless

426
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're sleeping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with them against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me it</font>

427
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,639
shot before you

428
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:50,570
wellesley<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was confused and sweep on</font>

429
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:57,890
top of your sheets used by the shots I

430
00:20:50,570 --> 00:21:01,970
see congratulations you know Pepsi so

431
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:05,810
keep it free so that's that's one of the

432
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,750
things is<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you start to put a larger</font>

433
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,490
conference together it is very difficult

434
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,380
to pay for everything out of your pocket

435
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,810
the first guy talk on we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

436
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,100
came out of my pocket<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mrs. Scott</font>

437
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:21,770
Khan's pocket and it was painful it was

438
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,230
like buying a mid-sized sedan it was

439
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:27,110
yeah so something like this can actually

440
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,730
be done in a halfway decent price and

441
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,070
when we can have a blast<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it if it</font>

442
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,410
gets really really large it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a</font>

443
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,820
lot more difficult to juggle and I won't

444
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,630
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me do anything but a donation-based</font>

445
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,480
conference it also keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> us sane so</font>

446
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,670
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every Sunday I sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down in</font>

447
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,170
the library of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house and sit in</font>

448
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,270
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer and I work all day</font>

449
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,670
long doing graphics calling people

450
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:52,820
sending emails working all kinds of

451
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff if outer zone were to get really</font>

452
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,000
really huge running two of them a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

453
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,560
is pretty daunting so we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it</font>

454
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,390
small because it's easier to put

455
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,490
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually got to put this</font>

456
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,440
slide slide deck together today which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

457
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,180
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first times in 9 years I've</font>

458
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,580
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and do a proper</font>

459
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:14,040
slide deck of the closing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tongs</font>

460
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,750
during the slide during the creation of

461
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,730
the slide deck now the presentation of

462
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,320
it we're not done yet but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

463
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:23,700
kisses on the neck made it all

464
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:28,260
worthwhile<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try how come over my so how</font>

465
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,370
easy it takes roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to two and a</font>

466
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,540
half grand to put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this together</font>

467
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,449
which probably doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look that way</font>

468
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:40,470
from the surroundings but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

469
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,960
they're facing that the rig and

470
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:44,520
everything skydog<font color="#CCCCCC"> Khan is actually the</font>

471
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,670
reason we have the nicer rig than we had

472
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,710
before projector doesn't say Vanderbilt

473
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:53,360
University when it goes into power-save

474
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,250
mode which trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm so happy about</font>

475
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,139
so but a lot of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other expense</font>

476
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,730
with you know traveling down here in the

477
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,990
hotel and<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the space and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

478
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:05,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go on you know I earlier it</font>

479
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,950
was like someone making a beer run<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

480
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">right we want three you know three cases</font>

481
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,910
of beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's that you know so a lot of</font>

482
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,300
times like that stuff can add it pretty

483
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:18,000
quick an outer zone is run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

484
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:22,889
pockets in our hearts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a</font>

485
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,730
it's not a money maker it is it is

486
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely just a lot of fun it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

487
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably if I didn't make my money back</font>

488
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,860
on it would be a heavily expensive party

489
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:39,210
but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a blast anyway</font>

490
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:42,299
so how to 0 Z plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

491
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,950
so if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

492
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,408
already there's a bucket up here throw

493
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,789
some cash in the jar if you can one of

494
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,159
the things we've always liked about an

495
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:52,140
hour zone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the guy who wrote in your</font>

511
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,399
right now but they do it because they

want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share their knowledge with</font>

do it at Pearl and I got you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

600
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,680
someone's going to give me a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

601
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,630

602
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,740
about I'll do sudo codes all right now

603
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:30,110
thanks Billy suck my balls building so

604
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,350
my my standard deal for outer zone has

605
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,870
always been if I lose my ass two years

606
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a row and lose my SS to be decently</font>

607
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,780
substantial if I lose my ass two years

608
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,370
in a row I'll stop doing outer zone

609
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,760
because it means I'm doing something

610
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:46,729
wrong or no one wants to show up anymore

611
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,760
so the general<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if donation is less</font>

612
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,090
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and years lost ass is equal to</font>

613
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,970
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> greater than two what totally flipped</font>

614
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:59,049
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> so totally free are they giggling no</font>

615
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,269
no they're redoing the whole thing

616
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:13,149
I'll consult with you next time to do

617
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:16,679
the proper code cut you Nick I justice

618
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:21,629
is uppercase<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your feet lower case</font>

619
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:32,889

00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:50,109
zone plus 1 this is the general formula

625
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:51,518
we've gone by so far I've been able to

626
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the numbers of gum yeah it's not</font>
