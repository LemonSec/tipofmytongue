00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,720
later one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us will thanks</font>

145
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,770
yes yeah

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:11,030
I think it's producing sound now the AV

147
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,120
guy so cool shipping up to speak so you

148
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,099
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all hell is going to break loose</font>

149
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,140
but we're getting audio levels on the

150
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,640
camera so we don't hope this sound like

151
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,120
static when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up online</font>

152
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">got dead so what I am so glad of that</font>

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,450
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was we've seen my various</font>

154
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,310
negative comments about you in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font>

155
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,780
considering considering Noah's

156
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,540
excitement at the fact that we're about

157
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:36,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this I'm a little bit terrified so</font>

158
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:42,290
because he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

159
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:45,290
things coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah come on down we</font>

160
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:51,170
have we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know obvious</font>

161
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,550
problem i'll chime in here too yeah it's

162
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,000
pretty much all I've way up here right

163
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,620
now yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a research project</font>

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,080
we've been working on for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

165
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven months now the three of us a lot</font>

166
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of hard work has gone into this and I</font>

167
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,600
hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> you appreciate our powerpoint</font>

168
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,849
presentation for yes we go so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

169
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you put in those those transitions in</font>

170
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,660
the end the sounds that I want forgot

171
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects and all the transitions but</font>

172
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:20,270
here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so this is lesson topic 5.3</font>

173
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:23,810
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be bad alright everyone</font>

174
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:28,180
welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our lesson today today's</font>

175
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,639
purpose Shelby

176
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:37,839
not directly is this artist which is

177
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:40,360
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of late the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dolphins the purpose of</font>

178
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">purposes detect we wanted to design</font>

179
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">porpoises and train them to detect</font>

180
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,910
landmines we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> land my distance i</font>

181
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,779
should say underwater mines to take out

182
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,670
submarines now those written ways you

183
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,439
can measure them and generally we want a

184
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">decent-sized porpoise we don't want to</font>

185
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,529
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over man by any kind of boat coming</font>

186
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,850
over good and kill it we wanted these

187
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,640
inside posters purpose and we want to

188
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,380
breed a better breed of porpoises can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

189
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,430
do a breed dogs to actually kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of late</font>

190
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,890
if you go back into the evolutionary

191
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,420
chain so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> plot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plan just put</font>

192
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:13,420
them in a tank and shove them really

193
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:17,589
close and happens yeah i mean we

194
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,329
could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and actually a challenge</font>

195
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is determining whether or not they've</font>

196
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,310
actually they're pregnant or not you

197
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,660
know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah you know but we use</font>

198
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,719
rabbit and the rabbit dies we'll all

199
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,060
good yeah yeah yeah so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested on a</font>

200
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,459
few different species here and the two

201
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,890
am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know we want them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do right there</font>

202
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">because we're breeding them to find land</font>

203
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,760
mines so and then we've we've also knows

204
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,680
been training them with his special

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,890
high-pitched voice skills to to

206
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,420
communicate and in a language that only

207
00:09:47,890 --> 00:10:06,790
Noah can understand which he will

208
00:09:49,420 --> 00:10:08,170
demonstrate in a moment so obviously

209
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,640
this is what happens when a land mine

210
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,150
goes a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people didn't kill</font>

211
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:17,529
awaiting the building right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so well</font>

212
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:20,260
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the recording of phase</font>

213
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:24,040
of the experiment we had some problems

214
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:27,010
and one of them we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost a few dolphin</font>

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,990
see it was an explosion there were

216
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,850
several dolphin fatalities luckily we

217
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,390
did it on purpose but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

218
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,390
before the yeah

219
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:39,589
yeah he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to kill some</font>

220
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,290
dolphins and so our next experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

221
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:46,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Taste besson 54 is about bats and</font>

222
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:52,519
porcupines so we discovered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

223
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:54,410
were non-self reading and we these they

224
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,300
actually they didn't have any hands I

225
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this is a typo issue to All Hands</font>

226
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,660
that should be Finn's but the

227
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,980
instrumentation that we use to measure

228
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:09,319
and calibrate the dolphins and their

229
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,779
landmine detection these were well so

230
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,490
these were some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the test</font>

231
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:18,019
equipment pieces that were embedded into

232
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:20,029
the land mines yeah yeah we learned it's

233
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,470
important to sedate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dolphins before</font>

234
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,560
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to insert these things instead</font>

235
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,850
of them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are dim you met</font>

236
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,959
magnets since you don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

237
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,459
these inside the land mines but in

238
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,369
certain dolphins I mean the don t close

239
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,319
to four<font color="#CCCCCC"> land mine it attracts them to it</font>

240
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,870
it blows at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> land mine so yeah I'm</font>

241
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,430
solved the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> chunky to it's</font>

242
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,320
kind of a one-shot deal we haven't

243
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,209
figured out a way to keep the dolphin

244
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,209
the survival ratio is very low here

245
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,990
that's whales so there there's there's

246
00:11:50,690 --> 00:12:00,079
there's way too many dolphins<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japanese</font>

247
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:03,250
oh wait yeah so for those of you that

248
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,569
that never saw the highest video

249
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next the next presentation will be</font>

250
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,880
on our new game with involving bats and

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,339
porcupines so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

252
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">dolphins what what happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there an</font>

253
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,990
equivalent substitution

254
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,740
he finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a good aluminum there's</font>

255
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:30,080
there's not really much substitute my

256
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,360
favorite bat solid box bad have you seen

257
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flying fox bat it looks like a</font>

258
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">freaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fox of wings it's pretty</font>

259
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,350
awesome yes it is Anita bat look it up

260
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:47,000
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia I'm sure it's their flying</font>

261
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:49,100
fox bat continue just while we have a

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,950
break<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're quite questions about our</font>

263
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,420
dolphin experiment yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if any</font>

264
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,700
of you have any great ways to kill

265
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,649
dolphins and eliminate land mines at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

266
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:04,100
same time we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear about it hey</font>

267
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:07,070
there was a meth well again I defer to

268
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">know on that so those those the magnetic</font>

269
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:12,860
indicators so those for the male

270
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,260
dolphins it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a near the</font>

271
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,500
prostate there's a small cavity and look

272
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:21,290
the opening that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is the</font>

273
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">right size and then for basically they</font>

274
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,069
try to help you land mine it goes off

275
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,680
yeah I firm idea for women it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

276
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,820
female dolphins are just a cervical

277
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,770
implant that yeah dr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stroger yes many</font>

278
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,110
actually we all did many times several

279
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:44,089
times<font color="#CCCCCC"> a day yes um we're hoping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a</font>

280
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:46,010
grab well anywhere from an arrow there

281
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,760
was well we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much to reaction</font>

282
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:54,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah there are 200</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 02 600 depending</font>

283
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,089
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how strong the magnet is well</font>

284
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,360
it's kind of funny to watch that

285
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:00,589
try to swim away and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of them</font>

286
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,180
that's why we had to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bigger</font>

287
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,640
magnet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they kind of figured out</font>

288
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:06,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is a bad idea why my in the</font>

289
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,970
ocean at this point the electromagnets

290
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,320
we're hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some grant money from</font>

291
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,740
the DoD but we're still waiting for the

292
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,740
seal of approval

293
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,600
this yeah we've done several

294
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,600
documentaries this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial</font>

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,100
prototype that it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit that son</font>

296
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,710
they had that thing in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dog mccree in</font>

297
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,360
the ass it was too large does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit</font>

298
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,550
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> next to the prostate you know it's</font>

299
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of this big huge got this little</font>

300
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:37,050
blue gland and then you got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

301
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:41,010
Evan decide Evan was not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

302
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,660
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there but so so I we didn't have</font>

303
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,080
much of a budget on this one so I had to

304
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,660
go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the salvage yard and I'm the</font>

305
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:54,750
next phase is focused on on making it

306
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:59,430
smaller so some lube some tongs and

307
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:01,020
quaaludes you said so the challenges is

308
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,650
once you get it in the dolphin you've

309
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:08,189
got to flip the switch to turn it on

310
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,930
again yeah like because otherwise like

311
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,670
all the tests<font color="#E5E5E5"> land mines that we had you</font>

312
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,650
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh you know mines laying around the</font>

313
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:19,050
table they all just like anyways yes we

314
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">are as a matter of fact so we're going</font>

315
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,410
to show you some of the further models

316
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,390
that we developed after the prototype

317
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,790
was initially found to be too large for

318
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,960
the rectal cavity and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this</font>

319
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,490
one's much smaller than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

320
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,290
model which trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dolphins were</font>

321
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,290
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy about yeah</font>

322
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:42,170
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the operation the</font>

323
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,820
code code word it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like porn</font>

324
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,219
but with an extra X<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys because</font>

325
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,380
sometimes XXX it's just well enough you

326
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,600
know use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extra X involves animals</font>

327
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,220
you gotta ask species cuz you know you

328
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to add we kept it in the</font>

329
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,790
mammal family that I can't I can't give

330
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,060
away what it is it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

331
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:08,430
classified by reviving yeah so so so

332
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,709
today we had this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> breath dolphin</font>

333
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,770
I am 143 was the name of the procedure

334
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:28,470
that we used to to insert into the

335
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:29,880
receptacle and ie the dolphin yeah and

336
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">then and then after you get it in there</font>

337
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:38,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge that up and Danny I</font>

338
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:39,630
don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but yeah that's the next</font>

339
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase the problem is those dudes are too</font>

340
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:45,360
slow and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of lazy and you</font>

341
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,890
know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that manatees</font>

342
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,020
would the original inspiration for

343
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,660
mermaids how lonely and drunk woody

344
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,130
sailors that's what I want to know why

345
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,630
you not everybody likes pageants there

346
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,630
you know you're gonna have your fun

347
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,580
we're all healthy here I see one woman

348
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,810
in the audience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the illumination</font>

349
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,810
switch it off so I'm across

350
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:15,530
yeah so ultimately and ultimately this

351
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">equals success and eventually we want to</font>

352
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:24,920
put backpack nukes on top of the

353
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:26,869
dolphins and pulse see mine eliminated I

354
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,270
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> after all the love us that we</font>

355
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:33,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">fitted up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2d batteries is no big</font>

356
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:37,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal Chavo so the range selector was</font>

357
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:42,530
very important and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put this up</font>

358
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:44,690
here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i liked the logo well we we</font>

359
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,460
haven't moved on to human testing no

360
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,710
we're still within the animal clinical

361
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,110
trial<font color="#CCCCCC"> Noah never left with humans in</font>

362
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:56,180
place so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I McConaughey's here all</font>

363
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:59,510
alone from the psychiatric ward again a

364
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,820
picture of success like this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

365
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,500
Evans definition of success when we

366
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,510
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave Evan alone in the lab this</font>

367
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much the result that's what</font>

368
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:12,170
the hemorrhoids of the purposes look

369
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:16,010
like after we were done so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

370
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:25,640
is the testing probe no would like to

371
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:26,900
know like to listen oh no so Noah Noah

372
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,790
every now and then would test the

373
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,380
equipment on himself and he really likes

374
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,970
to crank up the intensity or he caught

375
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,400
me once and he makes a big deal about it

376
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,410
it's so look this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we notice that</font>

377
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">we found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a 10,000 on a</font>

378
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:44,720
range of 9999 I was curious who I mean

379
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:50,539
who wouldn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know I just yeah so</font>

380
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:56,299
yeah yes this is a this is a floor model

381
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:57,830
we take it to trade shows and dis in a

382
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,700
kiddie pool for the little dolphin to

383
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,830
play in yeah so so we considered selling

384
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,020
this you know to like other

385
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:11,470
organizations to protect their water

386
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:14,330
facilities from land mines so baby yeah

387
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,830
we sold<font color="#E5E5E5"> one to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> waterpark believe it or</font>

388
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,990
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there apparently it's a big threat</font>

389
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,939
people quickly see minds about babies

390
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,380
porpoises is a smaller if you get these

391
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,830
little nooks and crannies into something

392
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,030
you gotta check for mines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

393
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little small to get in there</font>

394
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah baby porpoises use that the film</font>

395
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,780
of smaller units it's all good yeah no

396
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's no are keys right that's the</font>

397
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,899
miniaturization process for the less

398
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,010
mature and once again for those of you

399
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,780
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't notice yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know why</font>

400
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,379
we put an LCD on it cuz after you put it

401
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,039
in there you can't see it anyways so

402
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,360
correction the only way we get these

403
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,490
porpoises and dolphins to put these

404
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">probes inside let's begin LSD so that's</font>

405
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:57,640
just a typo yeah and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never have</font>

406
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">too many probe connectors</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes and then</font>

407
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:03,740
well there'd be cables that would come

408
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,929
out that yeah it was yeah and again well

409
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,179
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that know what volunteers for</font>

410
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:09,500
that that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm into I just</font>

411
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:12,679
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like listening to see what's</font>

412
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on up there and but that's a sort</font>

413
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:19,900
of a hobby of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> again another picture</font>

414
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the probe yeah it's his favorite part</font>

415
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:26,090
he said he modeled it after the alien

416
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,159
probe that was used again who hasn't

417
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,949
been probed by an alien definite did

418
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:36,909
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm gonna do</font>

419
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">this take away this is species the</font>

420
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,900
safety as we mentioned before we learned

421
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:46,780
a lot of ways not to put a bomb detector

422
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a dolphin all right and as you know</font>

423
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,408
Einstein would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just learned a</font>

424
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:58,100
thousand ways not to make a light bulb

425
00:20:51,409 --> 00:21:00,610
right so so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece is is never</font>

426
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:05,178
leave Noah alone with a dolphin

427
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:08,840
