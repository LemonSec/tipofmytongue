<font color="#CCCCCC">do you like to start should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:34,170
okay who here has heard of Bitcoin who

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,289
here uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I nathan bugh</font>

30
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:45,070
semi-regularly really used it at all

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:49,180
either yeah who likes math

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:55,630
who likes money who likes<font color="#CCCCCC"> lining money</font>

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:58,660
and math so if you heard a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin do</font>

34
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:04,720
you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually know what</font>

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:06,100
bitcoin is like at its hole excellent we

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,669
got a lot of a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people for this</font>

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:12,970
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go it good for those that don't</font>

38
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:15,130
know what bitcoin is is in its many

39
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,380
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a whole not only is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a new</font>

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,760
kind of digital currency it's the first

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,920
decentralized digital peer-to-peer

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,660
cryptocurrency not regulated or

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,079
controlled by a signal organization

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,660
government person or entity it is also a

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,310
complex peer-to-peer network the network

46
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:35,170
or the blockchain helps regulate

47
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:39,330
scarcity and market stability with no

48
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,890
central server or single trusted parties

49
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,140
because everything is based on Krypto

50
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,208
proof instead of trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin does not</font>

51
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,200
rely on any physical note or

52
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,200
representation

53
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,530
you can guess so standard currencies

54
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,450
right everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can relate to the dollar</font>

55
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,579
that's in your wallet right that's

56
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,179
backed by a government this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

57
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:06,299
sensitive to

58
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,609
so there's a central trust organization

59
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,500
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that right and I'm sure</font>

60
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,969
everybody's heard of recent financial

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,030
issues in the States or abroad even have

62
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,159
been more recent Cyprus I think it has

63
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">been the most recent one where the</font>

64
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,780
government is issued to stop on the

65
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,420
banks something was to detail behind

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,129
that they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take money but that</font>

67
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,250
yeah they control they controlled the

68
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,379
money more strictly people were grumpy

69
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,489
about them taking their money yeah so

70
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:42,689
about four and a half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago this one</font>

decentralized<font color="#E5E5E5"> currency where there isn't</font>

77
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,369
a centralized Authority for controlling

78
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,129
what the value is and who gets it and

79
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,709
everything one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with</font>

80
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:10,918
a decentralized anything is how do you

81
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust what's there or what somebody else</font>

82
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,180
says because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

83
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,168
centralized repository to do this and

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,620
they handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by requiring</font>

85
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:26,539
confirmations so the algorithm for

86
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin which is based off of a double</font>

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot allows the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a block</font>

89
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:40,120
yes which then has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reward for</font>

90
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,150
solving for solving it to be it used to

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,910
be 50 bitcoins is now 25 but now it's

92
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,840
plenty files of<font color="#CCCCCC"> November 2009 and every</font>

93
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's our 2011 for years it or halves</font>

94
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:56,979
and this is to control the supply in a

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,299
somewhat linear method<font color="#E5E5E5"> there only will</font>

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:05,140
ever be produced 21 million bitcoins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

97
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,080
then also to help control so there isn't

98
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,789
a rapid influx as it gets more popular

99
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,849
more people start mining or otherwise

100
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:15,220
trying to obtain them blocks can only be

101
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,820
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> about every 10 minutes and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

102
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,680
every 14 days one of the values<font color="#E5E5E5"> known as</font>

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,010
the difficulty in this algorithm changes

104
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,640
so that way it helps return the block

105
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:31,630
generation time back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes</font>

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:37,009
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when you wish</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to transfer from</font>

107
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:39,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">one person to another the</font>

108
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,909
you submit a message<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the network</font>

109
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,009
saying I want to transfer from one

110
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:44,960
address to another this transformation

111
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,080
will go into the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> block that gets</font>

112
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,388
generated hopefully there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

113
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">queue for a little while since there has</font>

114
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,849
been so much interest in so much

115
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:58,039
transfers and then after and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

116
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:00,469
block that gets found after this one

117
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:04,360
helps confirm the validity of your

118
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:06,680
transfer so stuff doesn't transfer

119
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,599
instantaneously it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> about an hour</font>

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,930
to two hours depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how many</font>

121
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:14,659
levels of confirmation the other party

122
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,990
wishes to have for your transaction so

123
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,938
this gets around the trust issue needed

124
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,680
the more trust you have the faster you

125
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:26,719
can do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well right so what have</font>

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,309
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered what is cryptocurrency it's</font>

127
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:33,319
basically based off math there's no

128
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:36,169
central government jump pretty neat what

129
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,360
is Bitcoin we covered that how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

130
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,859
coins right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay math is fun and all</font>

131
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,499
but how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get get some of</font>

132
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,939
these and start using them the most one

133
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:48,139
of the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular methods is to use a</font>

134
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:52,120
wire transfer or use the service to send

135
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:55,039
them your fiat money<font color="#CCCCCC"> or US dollars your</font>

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,819
euros your Australian dollars whatever

137
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,688
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that has value right now and</font>

138
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:04,789
get them to trade it for you into

139
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:07,659
bitcoins or one of the other popular

00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,639
talk about in a minute or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

trade in person with somebody anyone can

152
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,650

expect a pizza to be delivered from the

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,069
for me to compliment

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say I phone</font>

online commerce for life he's a queer

187
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,100
for transactions you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this today</font>

188
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,770
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying nope existing gateways</font>

189
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,980
and facilitate this rather simply you're

190
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:45,130
quite right no there's actually several

191

213
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:51,250
think yes everyone needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wallet cover</font>

214
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,600
that at all no right so you need a

215
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,070
wallet for your coins you get a place

216
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,930
the story tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about wallets</font>

217
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,080
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's there are many different</font>

wallets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have a a locally stored</font>

wallet bitcoin org<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe has a</font>

220
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,870
wallet you can download for for all

221
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,370
platforms you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the reference</font>

222
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:14,650
client as a wallet yes there are sites

223
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,670
like blockchain info that will allow you

224
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an online wallet</font>

225
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,640
using the reference client has the

226
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's completely</font>

227
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,540
decentralized because it actually

228
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,149
downloads the entire block chain itself

229
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,089
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about seven and a half to eight</font>

230
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:35,180
gigs right now for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitcoin litecoin is</font>

231
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,529
like two gigs though but then you have

232
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,050
the entire block chain so you can

233
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:41,600
confirm all the transactions that do you

234
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,479
you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being ones you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

235
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,149
ones you receive but it's huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

236
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,510
it takes it about eight hours or so to

237
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:51,740
actually sync up and become usable

238
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:54,279
there's people that have figured out

239
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,690
ways around this by hosting blockchains

240
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,480
electrum is one client that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font>

241
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,670
and get started<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a few minutes</font>

242
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,709
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use a hosted blockchain now</font>

243
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,660
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep any of the transactions</font>

244
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:09,369
or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about your wallet and</font>

245
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:12,260
your private information of your coins

246
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,810
they just use this hosted blockchain

247
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,770
instead to figure out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

248
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:20,420
transactions are valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and confirmed</font>

249
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:23,149
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had</font>

250
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,870
mentioned blockchain dot info and on it

251
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,490
hosts the wallet as well which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

252
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,220
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the electron that it's a</font>

253
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,630
hosted wallet it is it the blockchain is

254
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,220
hosted all the private is very Jimmy's

255
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,209
Nord on your sailor their apps for your

256
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:43,820
phones for wallets as well android and

257
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:48,420
iphone it precedent

258
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:51,090
can you trust anything it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

259
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,829
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JavaScript I believe yeah so if</font>

260
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:56,670
you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the time to learn</font>

261
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript and figure out their own code</font>

262
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:06,719
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then thus then trust it</font>

263
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:08,609
yourself I mean if you want that's the

264
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,290
trust you had the question is how do you

265
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's really the blockchain that</font>

266
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,719
they're hosting and that their own form

267
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:18,089
of the blockchain and that's that's the

268
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,030
question that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust line you can</font>

269
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,350
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust their blockchain there's</font>

270
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,060
instructions for using the reference

271
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,740
client to download the blockchain and

272
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,859
hosting your own version it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

273
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,470
secure if you hosted locally but I mean

274
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:34,050
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most people will trade that for</font>

275
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:38,100
convenience yeah there's a convenience

276
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,329
versus security in all things if you

277
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,490
want to host the reference client

278
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,140
yourself and run it yourself it's eight

279
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,590
gigs it doesn't use a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bandwidth</font>

280
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,590
once that's actually been transferred so

281
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:56,499
so you get into mining sure one of the

282
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,300
popular things is mining because free

283

order them a pizza online at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point</font>

305
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,740
it was worth about<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty dollars yeah</font>

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">forty dollars 10,000 bitcoins was at</font>

forty dollars at today's exchange rate

308
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:08,618
that's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million dollars yeah so</font>

309
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,570
it's it's a highly volatile market<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

310
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:16,110
as it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new</font>

311
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:19,650
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the difficulty</font>

312
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:22,260
before in that when more nodes get added

313
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the network and they start start</font>

314
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,850
calculating these hashes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding</font>

315
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,930
blocks and confirm them every two weeks

316
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,760
the difficulty goes up well usually goes

317
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,790
up it changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it goes down but</font>

318
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,030
most the time it goes up and that makes

319
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:44,040
it more difficult for the current cpu

320
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:46,230
miners to continue a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> while ago i</font>

321
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:55,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have times and dates on this I</font>

322
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:57,570
think GPA GP use a TI GPU specifically

323
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,939
have a much better integer<font color="#CCCCCC"> antigen thin</font>

324
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,790
NVIDIA GPUs those came around pretty

325
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:06,870
quick after that and they allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

326
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:11,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get much much faster hash rights in</font>

327
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:16,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">terms instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing safe in Busan</font>

328
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:18,030
this yeah it's like 50 to 80 mega hashes

329
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,630
a second you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on a standard</font>

330
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:24,000
quad-core GPU sometimes up into the 300s

331
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:26,670
if you really push it yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,490
pretty beefy box that with a GPU you can

333
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:33,449
get 300 to 500 mega hashes a second and

334
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:37,079
it's a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more energy efficient yeah</font>

335
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:41,079
what's the relation<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meghan</font>

336
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:43,810
blah that's what changes and that is the

337
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:45,339
difficulty and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so mega hat what is</font>

338
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,229
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> mega hashes is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

339
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,200
into a block that that is the difficulty

340
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:54,720
number when you when difficulty goes up

341
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:58,779
it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> more mega hashes to figure out</font>

342
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,910
what the answer is to the next block so

343
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:04,420
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course want to be able to find</font>

344
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:07,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">these faster and faster because human</font>

345
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,299
nature i guess in early 2011 code for

346
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,020
fpgas<font color="#CCCCCC"> field programmable gate aways gate</font>

347
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:16,389
arrays was released which again

348
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,400
increased the hash rate that one could

349
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:22,780
own and decrease the power needed to

350
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,569
drive these so more money faster and

351
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,418
then in early 2013 after a ton of

352
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:31,360
speculation a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese company named</font>

353
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:33,070
Avalon actually released the first ASIC

354
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,110
and started shipping it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

355
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,790
location specific integrated circuits

356
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:42,490
yep this is as efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can get</font>

357
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:48,059
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's an actual I see</font>

358
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:48,059
that computes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256 twice for you</font>

359
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,860
butterfly labs is a another company

360
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:59,230
that's based out of Kansas City they had

361
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,969
they actually sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs or they had a</font>

362
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,190
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they delivered on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fpga</font>

363
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,290
is but they have not delivered on any of

364
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,770
the asics yet yeah they were a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

365
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:12,940
slow between announcement and delivery

366
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,610
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FPGAs and they were also one of</font>

367
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,530
the more noisier voices about saying we

368
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a six and everything and they</font>

369
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally promise it'll deliver tomorrow</font>

370
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,440
or not yet we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually shipped</font>

371
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,820
in yet though<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've made that promise</font>

372
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,240
for over a year now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

373
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">be it's gonna be next week it's crazy</font>

374
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,840
yes

375
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,840
price for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACE</font>

376
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,390
they can tell you they're selling you

377
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,660
anything yeah until they actually start

378
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,660
shipping

379
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,080
they did deliver some<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f pjs</font>

380
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,990
aren't asics yeah delivering the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fe agas</font>

381
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,600
gives them credibility but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then saying</font>

382
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,330
they have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> asic and not shipping it</font>

383
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,620
let's think<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over a year destroys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

384
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think about how much how much money</font>

385
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,340
they've actually made in inflation if

386
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:10,110
their lowest product is about one

387
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,169
hundred fifty dollars yeah one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

388
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,889
friends pre ordered one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 100 fly</font>

389
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,870
labs a 64 $150 in Bitcoin<font color="#CCCCCC"> they I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

390
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,700
remember how many bitcoins he spent on

391
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,310
it but yeah he spent p traded bitcoins

392
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,440
for it or for a pre-order but nowadays

393
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:28,139
how much is that those buzzwords that

394
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was worth I think it was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

395
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,620
thousand dollars if you point eight

396
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost three thousand dollars yeah that</font>

397
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,379
just due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to inflation alone on the</font>

398
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,030
Bitcoin so even if they don't deliver

399
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,980
they've they've made a huge amount of

400
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:43,550
money not only in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin but the</font>

401
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,630
inflation sense they promised<font color="#CCCCCC"> to release</font>

402
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:52,200
yep so you right now at home could try

403
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:55,550
CPU mining if you want to use pooler's

404
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU minor which is a pretty optimized</font>

405
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:01,830
assembly optimized version of a popular

406
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,479
program and that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font>

407
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,110
difficulty is crazy high right now

408
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,660
because China's ship and all these asics

409
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,429
so you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do very well with</font>

410
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,530
that at all it's some spare change if

411
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can cover your electricity</font>

412
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,800
it's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars yeah you're not</font>

413
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,889
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for electricity hey that works</font>

414
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,440
right and it's enough to order<font color="#E5E5E5"> pizza at</font>

415
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,480
the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the month</font>

416
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,129
for all yeah you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font>

417
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crate exchange rates that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why I</font>

418
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to come with pizza farm if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

419
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:34,070
enter hiding it generates me pizza hey

420
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:39,678
pizza if you have ati cards a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4000 ati</font>

421
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:41,178
HD 4000 5000 6000 or 7000 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> newer those</font>

422
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,029
will usually anything a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

423
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:45,529
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> over over a gig of yeah if you</font>

424
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,289
have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a gig of ram on the card</font>

425
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:52,190
is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first things to look for</font>

426
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:54,679
mainly for one of the popular alt chains

427
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,870
they call them alternate blockchains is

428
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,139
called litecoin and that is based off of

429
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:03,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> script algorithm versus the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sha-256</font>

430
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:07,340
algorithm and that is way more memory

431
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,799
intensive but right now there's only cpu

432
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,299
and GPU miners for that so there's the

433
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,190
difficulties fairly low and you have

434
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,620
good chances of getting free money their

435
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,440
exchange rate is a couple dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

436
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,850
litecoin now I was like three to four I

437
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,470
mean it's gone from two and a half to

438
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,799
four this it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not bad and that</font>

439
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,409
it's a little bit more profitable with

440
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it all things being equal to do mine</font>

441
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:35,000
litecoin right now it is it still that

442
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:40,029
varies actually there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't include</font>

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,099
it here but there's a site here

444
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:45,820
questions yet but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

445
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:47,810
ask we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a GPU processing</font>

446
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,939
so I'm wondering if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

447
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,520
if you know anybody put together kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

448
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,510
a guide to building the least expensive

449
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,660
but proven profitable black box<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc video</font>

450
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">garbage but i wanna build a low end PC</font>

451
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,020
just generates many lenses<font color="#CCCCCC"> passes and</font>

452
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,360
we're in the twilight of GPU yeah that

453
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,980
was good like a year and a half we three

454
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,389
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago okay you're not really going</font>

455
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make substantial profit with GPU</font>

456
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:17,600
mining about six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I said hey</font>

457
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,040
why not let's put 258 50s in a rig spend

458
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,080
about six hundred dollars on it which is

459
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,120
more than I should have totaled to give

460
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,449
the thing up and running it paid itself

461
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,370
off in six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> prices</font>

462
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">also went from ten dollars a Bitcoin to</font>

463
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:33,949
142 horse of Bitcoin in the time so and

464
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,690
that those could hit in june two

465
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,540
thousand eleven is when it hit thirty

466
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:44,480
dollars and then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the August 2011 it</font>

467
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:46,970
was like five<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars a Bitcoin the</font>

468
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,100
other day yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah need now that's</font>

469
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:50,930
worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right it broke 100 on</font>

470
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,179
April Fool's Day yeah so if you want to

471
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">start mining now I don't really have a</font>

472
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,070
good answer for you because some people

473
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,850
have a six and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of hash</font>

474
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,470
rate and some people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> fpgas you may</font>

475
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,750
be able to get enough pga or something

476
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:09,020
off of ebay those are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about</font>

477
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:11,570
a grand or so and the hash rate isn't

478
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,910
that great and the more we reported to a

479
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">six but it does work the more people the</font>

480
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,690
more people that have their acquiring

481
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,870
the asics the higher the difficulty goes

482
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:25,360
up and it's even even less happy day for

483
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:26,949
GPU miners yeah so lasix come here

484
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,250
chips in our own cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tube that</font>

485
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,040
you live there you have real in cells a

486
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,900
box you plug into the wall and it starts

487
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,730
making the bitcoins completely it's it's

488
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,750
got the cooling which apparently is in

489
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:42,070
one of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the first</font>

490
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:43,929
batches but it's got the one up to four

491
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,990
different cards you buy at least one

492
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:49,240
card in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can put two three or</font>

493
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,950
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards in it and then you configure</font>

494
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,650
it with where to dump the coins once it

495
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,690
finds them or you can configure it to

496
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,950
connect to a pool and do all that which

497
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,309
we can get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we should get into</font>

498
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:06,370
play yes there's pools for all the coins

499
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:08,428
because it's not really in pooling your

500
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:10,989
resources or running a pool is

501
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,390
independent of how the coin itself

502
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,240
operates I think anyone can<font color="#CCCCCC"> start the</font>

503
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:19,799
pool yeah as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as you have trust</font>

504
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:23,950
there there's a couple of different pool

505
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:26,379
service servers I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would use</font>

506
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:29,980
the reference client to generate blocks

507
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,590
so all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually you would connect to</font>

508
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reference client and then say give</font>

509
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,309
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current values that I need to</font>

510
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,469
plug into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big equation to figure out</font>

511
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,309
what the next answer is and then you'd

512
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,350
start trying all the different

513
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:43,510
possibilities of a couple of different

514
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:48,250
values eventually you find when you win

515
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can you solo mine too yeah that that</font>

516
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:56,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sola mining it's just you and the pie</font>

517
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,159
made with I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this scroll never</font>

518
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:06,549
yeah so you can to get more profitable

519
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,190
or at least more predictable or roll the

520
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:12,429
dice yeah you can join a pool where

521
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:15,570
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is running a service that hands</font>

522
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:19,120
out sections of the valid range

523
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:23,110
basically so you're dividing up the work

524
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,418
and turn dividing up the reward the

525
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,389
payout systems yeah there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

526
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:31,570
different payout systems depending on if

527
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:34,390
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just get awarded for the</font>

528
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,860
word of specific shares that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do so</font>

529
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,280
every sure that you turn in has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set</font>

530
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:43,479
value to it you're done where is like

531
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,010
eight or about four millionths or

532
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,440
something to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin right now but</font>

533
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:49,330
then there's also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven million</font>

534
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,600
shares or something needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

535
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:55,629
blog then there's also what the the pp

536
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,240
that BPA PSP a chair there's DGM which

537
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:02,020
is double geometric method<font color="#CCCCCC"> my touch on</font>

538
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,110
that somewhere in here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer this</font>

539
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:08,049
method offers a more predictable payout

540
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:10,600
because when your pool has good luck and

541
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:13,330
is finding box faster than needed or

542
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,010
faster than what the diff States you

543
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,460
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be finding them at the pool</font>

544
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,379
operators will save up some of that

545
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,480
extra rewards so that way when the pool

546
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,940
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing so well they can pay that</font>

547
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,159
back out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minors and it's a more</font>

548
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,360
predictable if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go 24 7</font>

549
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:33,860
and just mine continuously that's a bit

550
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">more predictable</font>

551
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:39,810
once you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the money and you have the</font>

552
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,330
coins you have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in wallets another</font>

553
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">really fun activity is to speculate and</font>

554
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:48,240
trade them against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fiat or other coins</font>

555
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,580
very similar to forex trading it's an

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,020
occurrence of currency trading you can

557
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,970
even trade in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the forex</font>

558
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:59,220
exchanges with Bitcoin yep so exchanges

559
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,260
work exactly like currency exchanges and

560
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,120
exactly like wallets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send the coins</font>

561
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,530
to an address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they provide for your</font>

562
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,969
account and then swap back and forth

563
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:12,750
watch the charts go up and down and

564
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:15,420
panic and lose sleep over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic</font>

user system whose now fallen victim to

721
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:24,560
malware which is binding bitcoins form

722
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">mum cover all the aspects of it I mean</font>

723
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,230
if a male bear wanted to take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

724
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:32,900
system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would need over 51 percent of</font>

725
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:36,980
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> computing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power on the blockchain</font>

726
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,200
yeah see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had 51 percent of your</font>

727
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,370
own blockchain you could use that to

728
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,049
compromise the current block chain and

729
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,239
invalidate all previous valid

730
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,520
transactions there's there's some weird

731
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:52,219
stuff going on there people speculate

732
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,330
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone had all that power they</font>

733
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,089
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well just use it to mine</font>

734
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,890
bitcoin yeah it could yeah cuz that's

735
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:59,840
that's a crazy amount of power to get

736
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">51-percent of what's already currently</font>

737
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:07,370
been mined for 4 in a quarter years

738
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:12,130
there are a lot of malware and viruses

739
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:16,250
etc which do use<font color="#CCCCCC"> your machine as a</font>

740
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:19,010
Bitcoin miner be it for either the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

741
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,750
or the GPUs I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a reddit</font>

742
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,490
post actually where one guy was willing

743
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what he had done to create</font>

744
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:28,390
such a thing we'll have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that</font>

745
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:32,540
link yeah it wreaks havoc on the system

746
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:34,100
like any malware does I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

747
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,680
took steps to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wouldn't</font>

748
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">be traced or wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be noticed as long</font>

749
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:43,310
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was still making bank</font>

750
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,919
on that as far as wreaking havoc on the

751
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:50,090
Bitcoin system itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> received the deed</font>

752
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,950
haces it exchanges yeah there's over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

753
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:53,720
last two or three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Bitcoin</font>

754
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,730
has been receiving more attention and

755
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,669
got more popular there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

756
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,690
number of DDoS attacks on either

757
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:05,810
exchanges or the pools themselves trying

758
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:09,050
to prevent people from mining I guess

759
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,060
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really sure the intended outcome</font>

760
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:14,750
you are the end goal of this could be

761
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:18,380
the mess up or they're removing

762
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:20,540
power from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> hashrate so</font>

763
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,450
difficulty is not going to rise as fast

764
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,470
could possibly go down even yeah

765
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,230
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is what they're trying to</font>

766
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:30,480
do at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point it's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speculation no</font>

767
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:35,910
one really knows what the what their end

768
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:39,290
goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> or who's attempting it was that</font>

769
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,290
adequate enough any other questions

770
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:48,150
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the smallest number</font>

771
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:52,790
that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin can be divided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into is</font>

772
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,790
eight decimal places thank you

773
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright could you describe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raisins yeah</font>

774
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,080
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fun thing called an</font>

775
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,660
orphan race which that happens every now

776
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:12,470
and then with a win your mining or yeah

777
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:15,420
two independent parties can discover a

778
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:19,279
possible solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> block at</font>

779
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,440
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> importantly</font>

780
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,850
before one knows that the other one

781
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,070
discovered it so every now and then the

782
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:31,080
blockchain actually forks on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

783
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,650
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's two possible blocks and</font>

784
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,569
that's where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets odd because the</font>

785
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:39,090
orphan race now is to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out which</font>

786
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:42,060
block will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be propagated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

787
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,100
network fast enough so that way other

788
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,920
people build off of their block instead

789
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:49,410
of their opponents block and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

790
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,540
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other block is then</font>

791
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,609
orphaned because they don't want because

792
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,880
if the blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> Forks everything</font>

793
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,590
becomes valueless so people want to

794
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,680
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> building off the longest chain</font>

795
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:04,850
and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point there will be two</font>

796
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,290
heads to that chain or two tails I guess

797
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,150
so that's an orphan race to happen

798
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:12,020
occasionally they're usually resolved in

799
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,020
about 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 minutes</font>

800
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:17,750
it's gone it's worthless those yeah

801
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,180
those transactions you better I'd all

802
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:22,490
the work you did yeah the reward that

803
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:29,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">was in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block is not valuable</font>

804
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:33,169
anywhere even winded bike yes well you

805
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,700
could but in order to actually spend

806
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,390
those coins you have to get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

807
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,879
transaction of the next block and that's

808
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:45,560
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to beat the first so</font>

809
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,770
hey I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it let's wait right now pretty</font>

810
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,770
much

811
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:57,920
a block before nest and I think what

812
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,690
any other questions nope

813
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,690
thank you kiss
