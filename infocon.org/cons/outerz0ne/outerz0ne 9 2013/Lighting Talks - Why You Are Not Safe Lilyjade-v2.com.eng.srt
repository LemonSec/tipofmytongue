5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,180
promotional product that we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,948
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out on the web which is an ad based</font>

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,529
software that allows people to earn off

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,269
of extensions the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box as most people don't</font>

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,049
understand is what you should fear about

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,840
extensions what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about</font>

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,910
the extensions and what you might get

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,059
yourself into with these extensions by

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,129
not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have them the first</font>

put in their own code the only thing

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,360
you'd have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is implement it so what</font>

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,109
we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave a short description</font>

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,059
showing how that was implemented

24
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,340
following that we had to show that the

25
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,989
user in itself had to watch out for

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">different things such as also being</font>

of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did with Lily jade</font>

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,949
was we tried to get back to the users so

38
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,839
that way people who were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Terms of Service Agreement that</font>

make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the the user has to opt-in</font>

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,800
that is the whole entire deal with being

so that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to not only go in</font>

and be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run and execute and use</font>

it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done there's many different</font>

can actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> with five dollars paid</font>

79
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,840
and put into the Google store we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

80
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,049
to actually show the different benefits

that are there everybody that's here is

actually seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this screen</font>

83
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,840
we set it up to also make<font color="#E5E5E5"> its that way</font>

84
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,310
we can protect people part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is also doing like a</font>

different keyword matching such as you

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,130
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't even matter I mean a</font>

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,750
vulgar language and so forth that would

91
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,609
you wouldn't want your kids you wouldn't

92
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,010
want your friends you would another your

93
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,260
business to have employees going and

94
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:10,000
trolling on porn sites certain

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,829
extensions can be done I know I know now

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,780
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have that at</font>

97
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,190
home business and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little leisure</font>

98
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,190
ish<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

99
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:22,900
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things can all be declared as</font>

100
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,280
a statement now the biggest benefit that

101
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,919
we see with Lily<font color="#E5E5E5"> J that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

102
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming out this year is we are actually</font>

103
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:34,719
going to take and remove load balancing

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,389
and execution of code such as payload

105
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,180
execution pretty much essentially we

106
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,280
will be killing all the botnet I guess

107
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,280
you can save zero days anything that

108
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be out there it's going to be</font>

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,969
probably the biggest thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will end</font>

110
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,490
up from loading out as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> being one</font>

111
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,620
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual real time defense with</font>

112
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,720
extensions you don't have to use UAC

113
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,919
bypasses you don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff that's there you're</font>

115
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,770
already on an admin level with the

116
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:06,970
browser so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you can go back I</font>

117
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,500
think it's too we set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the event</font>

118
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,330
and listeners to where you can set up

119
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,240
certain time out functions these timeout

120
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:18,490
functions are put there as a beneficial

121
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,260
basis it's designed so that way users

122
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,419
can also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement what they</font>

123
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,969
would like so some people are going to

124
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:26,229
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interested in doing ads other</font>

125
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,000
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more interested</font>

126
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:35,979
in posting pinterest pictures Brian

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:42,820
and a few others recipes yeah I wouldn't

128

toast this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that most</font>

130
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,710
people everybody sits back and says oh

131

132
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the funny thing about it is is this is</font>

133
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a cross-browser it works on any</font>

134
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:04,510
computer from linux windows max these

135
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,770
systems and anything else that you can

136
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,120
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know a few people</font>
