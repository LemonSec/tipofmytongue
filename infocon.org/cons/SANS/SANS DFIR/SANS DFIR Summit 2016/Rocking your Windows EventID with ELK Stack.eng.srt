1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,270
(mellow intro music)

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,515
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,418
- Alright, being Brazilian
is not that easy anymore.

4
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:21,654
At least, we are supposed
to be good on soccer,

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:22,822
neither this, so.

6
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:24,958
So,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,363
long trip to arrive here,

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,297
have a very nice time,

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,066
thanks for having me here.

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,270
Enjoying a lot, conference,
new friends, free beers,

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,872
and all that stuff.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:40,907
I'm going to talk
about Windows Events

13
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:41,840
and Elastic Stack.

14
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,412
The talk will be
a little shorter

15
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,580
than it's supposed to be,
because they cut some time,

16
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,083
but I'm focused on the last,

17
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,487
I'm basing that everybody
knows Windows Events,

18
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,688
better than me, probably.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,693
So, who am I?

20
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,995
I'm security research.

21
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:05,598
We work in a product-based labs.

22
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,269
So we have a lot of fun,
studying stuff, learning,

23
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,137
and one approach that we have,

24
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:15,208
we are very open-minded
with our stuff,

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,810
and so, when I see
something interesting,

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,179
I try to share,
like to a webinar

27
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,147
or try to speak somewhere.

28
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,749
I have two patents,

29
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,517
about detecting malware, PDF,

30
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,554
and one for HP Heathers.

31
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,557
I love logging and pcaps.

32
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,959
I'm a dad now,
not now, two years

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,663
that using up all my free time.

34
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,999
I could not have
that fun anymore,

35
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,701
but used to it.

36
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,070
And I do triathlon
and I love beer

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,371
and that's hard.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,641
It's hard to love beers
and do triathlon, trust me.

39
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,713
And so our agenda,

40
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,515
the motivation to
create this stuff,

41
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,053
Windows Events, I
just have one slides,

42
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,656
Elastic Stack where
we spend more time,

43
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,560
I think like most
know about Event IDs,

44
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,464
Now I record some
demonstrations.

45
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,902
So I was doing a lot of
slides, and screenshots,

46
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,936
screenshots, screenshots,
say no, no, no,

47
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,939
I have lot a hundred slides,

48
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,408
and some conclusion
slides, just some tips.

49
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,710
And so motivation.

50
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,948
First, I want to detect
malicious activity.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,019
That's where it happen.

52
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,388
The second one, like fraud,

53
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:40,393
I want to monitor where, if
somebody's changing permissions

54
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:44,964
for our user, giving
administration, or somebody's

55
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:49,169
trying to access some
files not supposed to be

56
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,871
accessed by regular
user, this kind of stuff.

57
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,578
Forensics, like if you
want to see what's happened

58
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,946
in the past in your company,

59
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,348
you'll probably need to have
your log saved somewhere.

60
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,185
And Event ID doesn't
yet save it too long,

61
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,287
like depends on
the configuration

62
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
and the amount of the events,

63
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,325
you have like maybe in
some hours, minutes,

64
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:15,795
where you erase the old stuff.

65
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:21,134
Some thing that I like is
back to the future stuff,

66
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,069
I like to do threat hunting,

67
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,504
we are always improve
the detections,

68
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,739
the scripts we have
and what we like to do

69
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,110
is to run against all
the dataset that we have.

70
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,347
Because what usually happens is

71
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,250
when you think you are get on it

72
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,521
probably it's happened
like months or maybe years.

73
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,224
And so I want to do that.

74
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:49,228
And to do all that, you
have to have the events.

75
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,065
And so if you don't
have the events,

76
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,868
we could not find anything.

77
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,905
And as Bob Marley song, right,

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,108
no log, no crime, not that.

79
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,109
(laughing)

80
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,143
So we saved that.

81
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,614
Right so, talkin'
about Event IDs.

82
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,519
Basically we have
nine categories,

83
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,288
50 plus subcategories, hundreds

84
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,055
different Event IDs and fields.

85
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,426
There's a lot of information
that includes from there

86
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:25,031
like process creation,
access to a file, log ins.

87
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,302
One problem that we have
difference between Windows

88
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:33,539
versions and so like
sometimes you have everything

89
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,643
ready with some event IDs
and so they just change

90
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:41,614
everything else and I put
here a limit of 300 megabytes.

91
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,618
It's not exactly
that but after that,

92
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,555
depend on your machine
start to be a little slow

93
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:54,327
to handle the event and
just, if you want to know

94
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,030
more about Windows Events
and some other things,

95
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,265
stuff like that,
Michael that's here,

96
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,969
he has a nice cheat
sheet, I learned the word.

97
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:09,207
And Michael Archeology
website, he has cheat sheets.

98
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:17,383
He has a power shell to
enable everything for you

99
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,619
so that's a very nice resource.

100
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:23,690
And he's here if you
could talk to him.

101
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,459
So now talking
about the Elastic.

102
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,164
In the past it's
used to call ELK,

103
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,666
I think most of the
time so in like February

104
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,236
they did the last
call, last call.

105
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,205
And they changed a bit and they

106
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,707
start to call it
Elastic Stack because

107
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,644
now they have Beats and
so I think they don't

108
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,479
like ELK or something like that.

109
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,349
So they just call Elastic Stack.

110
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,851
And so Elastic Stack
is basically beats,

111
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,787
logstash, elasticsearch
and kibana.

112
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,692
Most of my time, I
would talk about here

113
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,261
at logstash on the ingestion.

114
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,932
I think where you
could do some magics.

115
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,369
And add content meta data.

116
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,508
And my talk will be based
on something as this.

117
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,679
Like you have beats sends
information to logstash

118
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:24,049
that we archive at elasticsearch
and so you have the API

119
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,452
here talking to elasticsearch
and you have kibana

120
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,454
with nice views and
everything else.

121
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,757
In the talk after mine,
they are going to speak

122
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,359
more about kibana
and the more detail

123
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,027
about the APIs so that's nice.

124
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,829
Because I don't have time
to explain everything

125
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,699
and so that kind of happens.

126
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,604
Good about having
that talk after mine.

127
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:49,409
And so the API here could
correlate with anything you want

128
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:54,180
that deny, so I will drill
down in every of the steps.

129
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,584
So when you have
Winlogbeat like most,

130
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,155
I think most of my deploys,
the production deploys

131
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:05,691
I'm using NX Log, I'm
not using Winlogbeat.

132
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:08,895
Because Winlogbeats,
they start to have other

133
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:13,132
information I need something
around May when they

134
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:18,137
released a version that they
send out the event data,

135
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,676
that information and so
mostly I have it in my labs,

136
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:27,180
in my stats but I am
not using in production.

137
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,082
I am storing in NX
log but both works.

138
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:35,087
NX log has some restrictions
about some information

139
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:41,193
in a very specific, in
very specific situations.

140
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,663
I don't have all
the information.

141
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,232
One point, I was like trying
to more enter the x chains,

142
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,637
the chains about the flow
axis to some account.

143
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,307
I have the information
like oh somebody has flow.

144
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,176
So I have who has flow
through other accounts

145
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,312
but I don't have who change it.

146
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,680
So that's the kind
of information

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,648
that's using Winlogbeats
that you have

148
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,818
or if you buy the NX
log, the pro version,

149
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,054
not the communes version.

150
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,655
So talking about Winlogbeats,
it's open source.

151
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,494
You could choose whatever
you want to send,

152
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,596
everything or specific.

153
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:21,601
It used some certificates just
to encrypt the communication.

154
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,270
It's pretty easy to
install, as NX log,

155
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,972
both are really simple.

156
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,776
Oh but if you want
to use anything else,

157
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,613
you could just use
suggestion about anything.

158
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,284
So we have logstash,
here is the nice part.

159
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,087
Logstash could receive
information in any format,

160
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:45,757
any format, it's
magic, it's something.

161
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,695
And after ingest information,
it could do some analysis

162
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,900
locally before adding
to the elasticsearch.

163
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,367
You could do some archiving.

164
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,605
You could generate alerts
directly at logstash.

165
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:05,545
You don't really need to send
information to elasticsearch.

166
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,850
But the nice part, like you
could have multiple outputs.

167
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,185
You don't need to just have
okay, I centralize search.

168
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,155
You can centralize search
and an alert to put

169
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,924
you put your central is slack
or centralize page security.

170
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,562
And internally it
worked like that.

171
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,865
We have input,
input could be like,

172
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:30,870
it could become a
Sense log in some port.

173
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,440
It could read a file,
it could comment

174
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,109
that you pick the
information somewhere

175
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,745
and you have a lot of options
and you have a lot of codex.

176
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,848
That's important because
the codex do some magic

177
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,450
sometimes, just use the
codex, like you have codex

178
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,920
for net flow, you have
codex for event logs.

179
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,690
You have codex for
JSON and so those codex

180
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,693
make the life much much easier.

181
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,361
You don't need to
work that hard.

182
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,632
So you have the
filters that I'm going

183
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,334
to explain a bit
more about that.

184
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,502
But filters you have a lot
of options, a lot of options.

185
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,240
If you do to documentation,
you see that you have a lot

186
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,110
of different options,
a lot of alternatives

187
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,480
and one problem that
I saw, maybe it's me,

188
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,183
maybe a general overview.

189
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,018
If you go to the
documentation of, you show

190
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:24,023
the documentation, you saw
every sample is the same

191
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,659
and you figure out
like how I use that.

192
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,729
So I go to somewhere else
like people asking us,

193
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,431
you see a real
demo, a real sample

194
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,068
and say oh, that's it, so like
the documentation is not that

195
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,337
good in my opinion but it works

196
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,707
after you understand
that very well.

197
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,610
One thing I learned,
you kind of get

198
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,278
messed with a lot
of information.

199
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,547
And so you have the output,
the output as I said,

200
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,983
you could have one output,
like since we were talkin'

201
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,755
about the Logstash and ELK, we
are sending to elasticsearch.

202
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,758
But you could send to
another different place,

203
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,793
generate a kind of more alert

204
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,997
and save elasticsearch
for another reasons.

205
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:15,708
So logstash filters,
here is, I just add some

206
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,344
that I thought was interesting
to pass the information

207
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,916
to add meta data, grok
is a kind if you could

208
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,318
create a rule that you
could process your log.

209
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,920
Doesn't matter the
format log you have.

210
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,591
You could easily process
that information.

211
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:37,797
Geoip, Geoip is very
interesting because you could

212
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,534
geoip the search, the IPs
that you are receiving

213
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:46,505
and maybe you figure out
oh, why somebody from China

214
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,209
connect on my Rd,
remove that stock.

215
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,447
Why my machine is talking to

216
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,883
Ukraine, Arusha
or something else?

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,985
Maybe it's something
legal, maybe not.

218
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,190
We have the date,
that's very important.

219
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,093
Because when you date
your past information

220
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:10,863
with the date from the
event so it will ingest

221
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,533
through the search with
the really correct date

222
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,836
is not going because if
we don't have the date,

223
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:20,372
it will ingest mostly
with the date of the,

224
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:25,944
they're being ingest,
we have the cipher.

225
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,014
If you have something
critical you don't want to be,

226
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,818
don't want plain text, you
could create, use a key

227
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,456
and encrypt the information
and so if you need to work

228
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,525
with that information,
you could decrypt.

229
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,963
So like Event ID probably
maybe you not need that

230
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,531
but depend on the information.

231
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,734
You have translated
and dictionary.

232
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:52,171
That's very very
interesting because it could

233
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,342
add meta data like a lot of
information are just codes.

234
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:01,013
And sometimes if you send
like to the analyst just like

235
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,649
a lot of codes, it would
take some time to process

236
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:06,152
because like especially like
Event IDs and so you could

237
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,221
like if these event
ID, add this message.

238
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,726
That you know that
they process faster.

239
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:17,630
Or maybe they stop
codes like some four,

240
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,334
let's put not found, let's
make the notes quickly.

241
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,171
We have the Cidr
that you could like,

242
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,775
like if those hinder IP,
add this tag, for example.

243
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,011
And so when you are
working with some API

244
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,880
or something like that,
you have another filter,

245
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,016
another option like oh,
this place, this Souvenet

246
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,019
is not supposed to
talk to this Souvenet.

247
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,354
You have names and
make much easier.

248
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,559
You have mutate that
you could remove feuds,

249
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,694
add feuds, add tags,
convert, chant.

250
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,531
You have the XML,
that's pretty cool.

251
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,868
Like for example, like the
data that can be showed,

252
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,673
during the forensics,
could easily input the

253
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,642
elasticsearch and create
some views and work with

254
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,744
the information there, that's
much faster than a person.

255
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:10,049
Like imagine if I wave a
million different XML entries,

256
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,983
it will take forever to grab.

257
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:18,457
Oh Json, that how NX
log send information.

258
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,994
That's pretty easy, like
you don't need the filter,

259
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,196
like before you
don't need a filter.

260
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,198
Mostly you don't need
a filter because if you

261
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,036
use the codex Json, it will
do all the hard work for you.

262
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:36,040
And Drop like this sometimes,
you don't want to depend

263
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,312
on the system administration,
administrator.

264
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:44,149
You enable everything, send
everything for me, okay.

265
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,052
I don't have process to
work with everything.

266
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,021
You just drop what
you don't want.

267
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,757
But when you want, you
have information there.

268
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,127
And so you don't need to
ask oh now enable that.

269
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,930
Now enable that, now
enable that so drop.

270
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,467
Or maybe drop something like
that were not being used

271
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,269
and using a lot of process.

272
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,707
So drop is make
life a bit easier.

273
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,113
And so Pro tip, since
like I'm thinking like

274
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:20,119
you're not adding only
Event IDs to the system.

275
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,590
So and if you're talking
just about Event IDs,

276
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,893
like a lot of different events,
they have different names

277
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,663
for IP like, you
have that IP address.

278
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,298
You have service IP address.

279
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:34,900
We have a few that's
called IP address

280
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,102
and so like if you want
to create some grab

281
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:41,006
for some views or correlate
with another data service

282
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,346
and if you use some naming
that you point like the

283
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,116
user name, the work station
because the only Event ID

284
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,354
they have different name on
the feud from the same content.

285
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:59,224
Imagine like when I want
to correlate with the ideas

286
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,095
and with the anti
virals or what everyone.

287
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,131
So I used to put
something like global.ip

288
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,733
and so I have that
extra variable.

289
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,834
I don't remove the old variable.

290
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,972
I keep the original variable.

291
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,975
But I add this so when
I need to correlate,

292
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,944
I have that variable that's
pretty easy for me to

293
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,579
and if I need to navigate
between different index.

294
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,384
You don't need to create
a new filter again like,

295
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,822
just make sure that I'm on time.

296
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,824
And so that's a very
simple config file.

297
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:38,297
You have input, PCP here
and not using beats.

298
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,301
I'm just showing
with the NX log.

299
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,703
We have a part, we
could choose whatever.

300
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:49,708
I add the tag just to have
a specific information,

301
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,779
like for example, Windows
active directive server

302
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,618
and so I put the codex here
and the type, I use that.

303
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:05,723
So and I use type mostly to do
some inside my configuration.

304
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,028
And so like this
is very important.

305
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,998
If you don't use codex Json,
that's not going to work.

306
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,769
Since my configuration
in NX log.

307
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,271
And so here I tried
to show some stuff

308
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:24,076
but it's a filter,
like if type AD

309
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,246
so I imagine the events
time, event is the feud

310
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,181
that has, and so
it has this format.

311
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,051
And so it could, as you
could see, you could

312
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,754
use any format you
want or you need.

313
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,322
And so like if that's
native address, mutate,

314
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:43,328
you add Feud with global
ip but you add dash

315
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:45,831
with the content, that's
the address, for example.

316
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:49,101
And I would drop IP destination.

317
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,004
And here with the service
and the IP address.

318
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:57,009
And so I will have everything
add to the same variable.

319
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,610
But I'm keeping the,
I'm not using remove.

320
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,980
Because we have remove
feud, you could just remove

321
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,585
the information, sure,
as more feuds we add,

322
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,089
we need more space and so
that kind of makes like,

323
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,557
if you don't have enough space,

324
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,492
you probably need to
remove some feuds.

325
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,596
And here I did the
same with some users.

326
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,834
But since users, you don't
have drop IP as much here.

327
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,639
And so like if I need to do
some graph or something else

328
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,275
and a very simple output,
you probably, you point

329
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,281
to the server you want, you
could have multiple servers.

330
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,386
The number four, the
codex, the index name,

331
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,591
I used to have separate
index for each of the

332
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,631
servers I have, I don't
put everything in the same.

333
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:56,068
Because could become
so big and global.

334
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,339
And that's kind of information.

335
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,341
Don't need to have
all that information.

336
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,744
If you put hosts here,
it's enough to send.

337
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,246
But you could have
like elasticsearch

338
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,149
and like here you could
have another that you

339
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,683
send with slack and
everything else so you could

340
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,653
just save the information
but you have a war room

341
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,356
that's slack and so
oh, something happened.

342
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:22,361
And so, or a ticket,
it's could code anything.

343
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,597
So it's very powerful.

344
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:30,702
So last search, I would
just, it's open source.

345
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:34,907
It's free, it's based
on Apache License.

346
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:39,244
And it's very fast,
that's I think the treat.

347
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,315
It's very very fast and
you could use a single note

348
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,519
or a multiple note and you
could grow very fast when you

349
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,524
need, that's a good side and
you don't need to pay extra.

350
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,095
Like you have a configuration
and you just duplicate

351
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,966
and change the node name and
it's part of the cluster.

352
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,337
One point that I
want to raise a flag.

353
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,873
It's very secure by default.

354
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,775
Like need to do some
hardening locally.

355
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,780
We do like saying
quickly you do a reverse

356
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,116
prox with ingen X so they
need to authenticate.

357
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,118
We have some
paranoid things like,

358
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,254
you could use cure
on the local host

359
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,891
on the part of elasticsearch.

360
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,228
We have a rule at the
IP tables that match

361
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,733
the user ID of root,
only root could connect

362
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,668
to the elasticsearch part.

363
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:41,206
So the user need to
escalate the privilege.

364
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:46,178
And you use LD to save any
comment that someone type

365
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,750
and so we are, at least we
know who did that or when.

366
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:58,824
And so we have kibana that
I am just showing briefly.

367
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,096
kibana adds covert filter
and analysis visualizations

368
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,065
that help improve the
analysis and the response.

369
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:11,570
Dashboards and plug ins,
plug ins most then are paid

370
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,039
and need a subscription
but they have time that

371
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,808
I really suggest you
should take a look.

372
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:21,680
And so here's a dashboard,
a simple dashboard

373
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,018
that I'm using the kibana
five, it's an alpha version.

374
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:31,023
But I like to live dangerous,
like I'm doing a lot

375
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,060
of fast but it's very
clean, I really like it.

376
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,164
And we have the pie on API.

377
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,100
There are probably going
to talk better than me.

378
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,337
But mostly you just
pipe install a search

379
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,039
and you are good to use.

380
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,176
Alright, I think that's it.

381
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,144
Do you have any questions?

382
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,346
I don't think I have time but.

383
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,448
- [Man] We've got time
for a question or two.

384
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,816
If someone's got a question.

385
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,918
- Okay, I hope we
don't have questions.

386
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,053
- [Man] Don't let
him off that easy

387
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,055
especially with that remark.

388
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,591
- No question about
soccer please.

389
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,126
(laughing)

390
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,995
Olympics.
- Anyone?

391
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,264
With that, thank you Rodrigo.

392
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,266
- Thank you very much.

393
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,035
(intense music)
