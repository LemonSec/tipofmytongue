1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,535
(soft music)

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,146
(applauding)

3
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,686
- So like Phil said,
I'm clearly not a local.

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,689
I'm from Cambridge,
intern, still undergrad.

5
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,159
Still got a bit of
university to finish.

6
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,427
So, that's my Twitter handle.

7
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,230
Security operations
analyst intern.

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,664
So I cover pretty
much everything.

9
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:35,969
Firewall configurations,
general NSM, malware analysis,

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,371
practically everything
you can think of.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,073
Sometimes I try and do
some red team stuff,

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,342
but I suck at it, basically.

13
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,210
Done a few CTF's.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,747
Done quite well in them, but,
I'm forever a blue-teamer.

15
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,951
I play video games, so
is anyone on Steam here?

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,989
Lot of people, as expected.

17
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,659
So how many phishing
attempts have you guys had?

18
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,562
You see this random shit
coming through all the time.

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,830
(chuckles)

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,232
Fantastic, mostly
rats, but, yeah I.

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,070
I analyze those every time I
get them, they're brilliant.

22
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,136
So, why are we here?

23
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:13,206
What is Dridex?

24
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,141
How does it operate?

25
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,078
Distribution, infrastructure,
what's a Locky?

26
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,546
I've seen a couple people that

27
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,047
don't understand what that is.

28
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,417
How scary is the future, Sev?

29
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,220
Terrifying, really terrifying.

30
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,823
And, obviously to look
at kittens, mandatory.

31
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,423
First talk that's gotta be done.

32
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:35,328
So, Dridex it's been
around for a while.

33
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,031
When I say a while for
me it's a while, 2014.

34
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,902
It's evolved from several
different malware families.

35
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:45,305
Has quite a complex
network infrastructure,

36
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,107
which I'll move
onto very shortly.

37
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,710
The target is everybody,
but when I go through it

38
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,779
a little bit more,
you'll see what I mean.

39
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,816
It is and it isn't everybody,
but we'll cover that.

40
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,017
As you can see from
the figures there,

41
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,285
it's making a lot of money.

42
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,588
From it's first
year, it's crazy.

43
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,089
I mean it's up there
with ransomware,

44
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,158
if not above ransomware,
and Dridex is still going.

45
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,327
So, it's pretty scary.

46
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,295
So this was the end of 2015.

47
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,998
This is from a semantic report.

48
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,268
So apparently Dridex
was taken down.

49
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,470
(crowd laughs)

50
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,338
I don't think so.

51
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,174
And same again.

52
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,109
But these are
human, look at that.

53
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,812
They take weekends off, they
take Christmas, New Year.

54
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,247
These are humans,
they're not robots.

55
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,916
I thought they were
robots, but, clearly not.

56
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:30,984
They're doing well.

57
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,553
And again, Dridex is up there.

58
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,755
It's huge in terms
of banking Trojans.

59
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,490
That's the one to look out for.

60
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,859
And Dridex anyone that's done

61
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,094
analysis on this will know that

62
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,561
it's not just the
banking Trojan,

63
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,031
there's a lot in there
that's really terrifying.

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,470
So, I started looking
at Dridex and.

65
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,273
Interesting story with this.

66
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,275
So I was maybe three months

67
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,311
into my internship,
taking my lunch.

68
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,782
Fired up my VPS, started
looking at a Dridex sample,

69
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,685
and I got called away to
quite severe incident.

70
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,921
So I just locked my
machine and left,

71
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,355
(coughs)
left this running,

72
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,257
and thanks to the
backconnect module on Dridex,

73
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,861
which turns your
machine into a Proxy,

74
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,096
you fire through the traffic,
you become a C2 basically.

75
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:21,935
Because of that I got
this abuse complaint.

76
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,169
I've redacted wo it's from

77
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,338
but when I saw it
I almost cried.

78
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,106
It was very scary.

79
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,944
And, top left, Dridex
Twitter account.

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,646
The first thing they tweeted
is, "Hi man, I like you."

81
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,715
Doing something right.

82
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,117
But that really annoyed me, so.

83
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,820
I spent a few months
just hammering Dridex,

84
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,722
getting sample after sample,
noting down the C2's,

85
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,725
reporting it to
friends in high places,

86
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,962
like a Telos gettin' it
blacklisted as soon as possible.

87
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,999
And they turned me into
an IoC, which was nice.

88
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,702
I'm pretty happy
with that actually.

89
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,203
I mean I'm an
intern, that's good.

90
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,071
I'm proud of that.

91
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,740
So the components.

92
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,311
We have the loader;
downloads, core modules

93
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,313
and a node list to
join the botnet.

94
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,350
The core is very scary.

95
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,219
Like I was saying, it's
not just a banking Trojan.

96
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,822
This will redirect
your HTTP traffic,

97
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,625
steal cookies, steal form data.

98
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,560
There's a lot of stuff
in there, and VNC, again.

99
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,296
It's not just a banking
Trojan, it's essentially a rat.

100
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,102
Backconnect turns you
into a C2, terrifying.

101
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,602
Makes it really complex to kind

102
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,305
of track this and
what's going on.

103
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,508
Sophistication.

104
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,676
Obfuscated code.

105
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,012
Everything's doing
that nowadays, I think.

106
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,580
I mean, I don't really consider

107
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,015
obfuscated code
sophistication anymore.

108
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,118
I mean, some of it's quite
difficult to crack, but.

109
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,486
Most of it's just crap.

110
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,454
It's really easy to figure out.

111
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,290
VM detection.

112
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,824
So I've run into
a couple of people

113
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,361
that have told be that Dridex
doesn't have VM detection.

114
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,763
And I beg to differ.

115
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:01,133
I've got a couple of
samples that do detect VM's.

116
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,568
So, it does do it.

117
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,671
It doesn't do very
well, it's quite basic.

118
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,006
But it is there.

119
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,974
And obviously sandbox detection.

120
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,777
Now the funny thing
about that is.

121
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,680
When you think about Dridex
and you look at it in the news,

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,481
you know, it's doing
really well for itself,

123
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,383
it's generating a lot of money.

124
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,186
But the code for their VM
detection and sandbox detection

125
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:24,590
was actually a reused code
from a Spanish hacking forum.

126
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,792
So they didn't write
that themselves.

127
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,761
It makes me wonder what
else they've sort of stolen,

128
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,096
just throwing it out there.

129
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,833
Targets all Windows systems,

130
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,968
but I don't really consider
that a sophistication.

131
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,305
I think the real sophistication
with Dridex really lies

132
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,042
in the network
infrastructure that it uses.

133
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:46,012
So it uses peer-to-peer.

134
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,315
I mean, I'll get onto
a network diagram soon.

135
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,950
There we go.

136
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,853
Infected machines, every
day users, random PC's,

137
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,688
PC's in the office,
PC's at home.

138
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:01,227
The nodes are, my VPS
would be a prime example.

139
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,529
That's where a
backconnect will kick in.

140
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,165
It will turn the
machine into a proxy,

141
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,067
and you're essentially a C2.

142
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,071
From there, traffic will
go to frontline C and C's,

143
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,875
so it's mainly like compromised
content management services.

144
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,878
Like Wordpress, Juno,
that kind of thing.

145
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,315
And a backend C and
C, which is hidden.

146
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,617
Apparently a couple of
people have found them.

147
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,087
Encryption changes.

148
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:32,158
So, I did mention Locky
on the very first slide,

149
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,659
but I'm not onto that yet.

150
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,195
This is more talking about
the network communications.

151
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,000
So back in 2014,
you would find that

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,569
it was used in
symmetric encryption.

153
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,572
It was a static
two byte XOR key.

154
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,107
You know, once you
crack that it's just

155
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,310
Gzip formats, pretty
easy to figure out.

156
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,648
Now, looking at something
more sophisticated.

157
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,017
Definitely harder
to crack, RSA 2048.

158
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,053
And the XOR key
is now four bytes

159
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,221
and it's randomly generated,

160
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,424
so you can still
figure that out, but.

161
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,493
The main reason for this is,

162
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:13,132
they use XOR encryption
for the traffic between

163
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,068
infected hosts, and
nodes, and C and C's.

164
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,406
And then they use
RSA 2048 for traffic

165
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,908
straight to the backend CC.

166
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,643
So, that's the sensitive stuff.

167
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,277
They don't want
you touching that.

168
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,248
So, Dridex targets everything.

169
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,855
As of October 2015, they
are the subnet botnets

170
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,592
that were found,
sub-botnet 2020,

171
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,095
220, sorry, was huge.

172
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,697
But it's also been
seen distributing

173
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,699
other malware such
as TeslaCrypt.

174
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,104
Once I saw this, I
was quite shocked.

175
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,209
Mainly because Dridex
and Locky, you know,

176
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,579
when you analyze these things
you figure out that they use

177
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,348
the same sort of
distribution network.

178
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,784
So you'd think that
the malware offers

179
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,053
are either the same people or
they're working with somebody,

180
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,188
and then to see
TeslaCrypt come through,

181
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,789
I started to correlate
them a little bit.

182
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,258
Don't know if they're
working together

183
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,996
or if the distribution
network that Dridex uses,

184
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,600
which is now believed
to be the Necurs botnet.

185
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,371
If people are just renting that

186
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,972
and spreading whatever they can.

187
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,111
Botnet 123 was
interesting as well,

188
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,715
'cause Angler exploit kit had
a whole new infrastructure

189
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,751
set up just to distribute
Dridex and Locky.

190
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,653
So again, are they
working together

191
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,389
or are Dridex really making so
much money that they can just

192
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,758
build a whole entire
exploit kit infrastructure

193
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,527
and just spread
whatever they want.

194
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,564
Botnet 124, that's
another new one.

195
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,901
Targeting Swiss
financial institutions,

196
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,569
but all of these sub-botnets
are targeting different things,

197
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,906
different countries,
different banks.

198
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,141
So, when I say they target
everything they technically are.

199
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,745
But it sort of depends what
sub-botnet you run into.

200
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,116
So file distribution,

201
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,218
they've used a couple
of different methods.

202
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,387
Mostly weaponized
office documents.

203
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,356
It makes sense, phishing
is just the way to go

204
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,760
if you're a nasty
person with malware.

205
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,862
So old people will
always fall for that.

206
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,799
It's true, you know it's true.

207
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,367
RockLoader was
seen quite recently

208
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,136
in voicemail phishing, emails.

209
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:31,536
Again, people will
fall for that.

210
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,005
There's not enough training
out there and still

211
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,708
training doesn't work for
phishing, from what I've seen.

212
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,145
The last point here is
actually quite inaccurate.

213
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,146
This has changed recently.

214
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,283
The executable for
Dridex has changed.

215
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,588
It's no longer six
random characters,
it's eight, I believe.

216
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,058
But, when you see that,

217
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,829
Dridex or Locky, I've not
really seeing any other malware,

218
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,431
sort of using six or
eight random characters.

219
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,667
Someone could prove
me wrong, but.

220
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,803
In terms of huge malware
that's really lucrative

221
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,372
and prolific out there,
Dridex and Locky.

222
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,707
That's what you'd look for.

223
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,543
Locky, it's the same as every

224
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,844
other ransomware
isn't it really.

225
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,613
I mean, in terms
of sophistication.

226
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,649
It's quite painful.

227
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,789
But again, delivered via
weaponized office documents

228
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,326
and exploit kits, encryption
that you're not gonna beat.

229
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,363
Deletes shutter copies of files,

230
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,666
which is the same as practically
every other ransomware.

231
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,533
Mostly.

232
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,668
I mean we've seen what,

233
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,470
like 150 new ransomwares
since January?

234
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,771
And it's only increasing.

235
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,107
There's like five or six
last week, it's insane.

236
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,881
Yeah, so, Dridex had a
revision at the start of June.

237
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,818
Again, targeting
different banks.

238
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,687
This one was US,
China, and Brazil.

239
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,891
And the last point is actually
supposed to be sarcastic,

240
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,794
but that probably
doesn't make sense.

241
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,499
So, Certutil, it's not used
to evade detection further,

242
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,302
it's used in this case
just to decode base64.

243
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,072
But I was looking through
tons of news articles

244
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,408
and they were saying, oh Dridex
is getting really complex.

245
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,510
It's using this to evade
detection, it's not.

246
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,146
It's using it for decoding
base64, it's nothing huge.

247
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,583
Takeaway, so, again.

248
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:28,254
First point, I think it's
safe to say that's now Necurs.

249
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,192
But there was also
the 50 individuals

250
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,327
arrested in Russia, recently.

251
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,564
I don't know if that's
the cause for, you know,

252
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:43,102
the disruption with Necurs and
the disappearance of Angler,

253
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:45,137
which has been gone for
a couple of weeks now.

254
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,208
But, if it's not Necurs,
Dridex, and Locky,

255
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,043
I would say there's something,

256
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,478
something secret going on there.

257
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,479
There's a huge distribution
network under there

258
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,682
and I would be inclined to say

259
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,584
that they may be renting it out.

260
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:03,222
Especially seeing TeslaCrypt
come through on sub-botnet 220.

261
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,557
These campaigns aren't perfect.

262
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,192
There's flaws everywhere.

263
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,561
I mean, the C and
C panels have been

264
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,429
cracked a couple of times.

265
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,896
It's been figured out.

266
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,300
But, as you can see from the
slides that we've been through,

267
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,868
it's only getting worse, it's
getting more sophisticated.

268
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,772
And with everyone focusing
on ransomware at the minute,

269
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,941
I think Dridex has got
quite the advantage.

270
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,676
'Cause when you hear ransomware

271
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,044
after everything
you see in the news,

272
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,446
it's nothing compared to
just a banking Trojan.

273
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,015
But, as we've seen,
Dridex is way more

274
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,350
than just a banking Trojan.

275
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,753
Yet still one of
the most lucrative

276
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,056
and prevalent
campaigns out there.

277
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,861
Even after this sort of, bit
of downtime they had recently,

278
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,496
they have started to come
through again in the last

279
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,765
couple of days,
Dridex is coming back.

280
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,068
Criminals again, that
transition into ransomware,

281
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,302
we've all seen that.

282
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,871
I mean ransomware's
not exactly new.

283
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:56,776
But utilizing a symmetric
encryption and stupidity,

284
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,211
people clicking random
office documents,

285
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,180
enabling macros, it's
easy money for them.

286
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,152
And ransomware has a somewhat
flawless business model.

287
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,586
I mean, you encrypt a machine.

288
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,855
If they pay, you've won.

289
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,690
I mean, that's it.

290
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,361
Any questions?

291
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,733
- [Man] Have you done any
analysis on the variation

292
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,536
in the carrier phishing
emails that they're using?

293
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,071
I've seen a bunch of different
formats and encodings.

294
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,112
- No I haven't, it's
something I need to do.

295
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,346
But obviously as an intern,

296
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,549
I'm really buried with
work at the minute.

297
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,483
I mean, this is actually
a side-hobby of mine.

298
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,120
So, after working as
security operations analyst

299
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,722
I'll go home, maybe do a
couple of hour's work on this,

300
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,491
and then sleep,
completely pass out.

301
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:50,496
24/7, 24/7 InfoSec, so.

302
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,236
- [Man] Since so much ransomware
and all kinds of malware

303
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,038
these days have been
delivered through

304
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,974
malicious office
documents and macros,

305
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,876
and enabling content and stuff,

306
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,645
it seems like one of the
best recommendations,

307
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,480
if it's feasible for the
businesses to push out

308
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,551
the group policy to disable
enabling content in macros.

309
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,553
Do you know any other,
like, remediation tactics

310
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,655
that might be effective for
stopping different types

311
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,557
of ransomware, like
have you come across

312
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,994
anything that you've seen
to be somewhat effective,

313
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,963
or more than somewhat effective?

314
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,735
- So, Cylance are
developing what seems

315
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,437
to be a really strong product.

316
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,906
I mean, every piece
of ransomware they've
thrown at that.

317
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,674
It's just shut it down.

318
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,977
In terms of things
you can do without

319
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,079
throwing a load of cash
at security products.

320
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,314
I mean you can do things
like disabling executables

321
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,818
from running from temp, and
update, and things like that.

322
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,252
It's just basic things.

323
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,589
And I'd say, honestly,
train users more efficient.

324
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:51,857
Keep training them.

325
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,324
Do like a monthly
thing if you can.

326
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,526
Just keep going with it.

327
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,531
- [Host] Other questions?

328
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,835
Oh that's hot, here.

329
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,779
- [Man] So, we've captured
some Dridex a few months ago

330
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,181
and then, you know,
we re-execute it

331
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,917
and analyze it and
stuff like that,

332
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,688
once they took down Dridex
it didn't work anymore.

333
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,456
Do you have any recent payloads,

334
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,425
like you mentioned June 2nd?

335
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,959
And how is it different?

336
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,131
- I have a sample from June 2nd.

337
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,033
The only difference
that I've seen

338
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,635
is the base64 with Certutil.

339
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,006
In terms of the new samples
that are coming out now,

340
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,274
I've been out here,

341
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,310
I've not had a chance
to look at those yet.

342
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,012
- [Man] Ah, okay, so
they work currently?

343
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,017
And the C and C's are working
actively, and all that?

344
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,552
- Yes.

345
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,120
- [Man] So how do you clean it?

346
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,222
- What do you mean?

347
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,692
- [Man] How do you clean
it off your system?

348
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,826
- Clean Dridex?

349
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,528
- Yes.
- Well.

350
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,930
- [Man] Is it still
memory, memory only?

351
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,634
- So, this was supposed
originally be a one-hour talk,

352
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,169
this is completely cut down.

353
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,471
I've missed out a bunch of
indicators of compromise,

354
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,741
which I'm gonna provide
in a follow-up blog post.

355
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:20,045
I'm gonna post what
I seem to consider

356
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,781
somewhat effective
remediation techniques.

357
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:26,185
I mean, as good as with any
incident response in forensics

358
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,488
we look for the IOX,
figure out what's going on.

359
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,557
Bring in all of your
data, analyze everything,

360
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,425
figure out if it's
spread anywhere.

361
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,959
But, yeah.

362
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,864
- [Man] One other thing
that I'd actually,

363
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,600
add on, my perspective
as you may know

364
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,102
is definitely on
the network side.

365
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,603
We've actually come up
with a lot of network-based

366
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:47,238
indicators, whether
you're looking at DGA's,

367
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,742
trying to identify the
likelihood that a domain

368
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,910
or a host name is interesting

369
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,146
so that's another
area of interest.

370
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,149
Whether it be the command of
control channels themselves,

371
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,151
the certificates that are
being used to secure it,

372
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,819
or the ancillary
DNS-type activity.

373
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,356
So it's another way of
detecting, not gonna prevent,

374
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,125
but definitely gonna detect.

375
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,262
- [Man] This is
just kinda general

376
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,697
but I'm wondering,
particularly as a student,

377
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,800
how did you get into
this kind of research?

378
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,769
And do you have
any tips to others

379
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,438
who might wanna follow
in your footsteps?

380
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,509
- So when I was
about 14 years old,

381
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,245
I was addicted to video
games, as most teenagers were.

382
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,947
I got so addicted that if I
wasn't playing a video game

383
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,181
I had to be watching
a video game.

384
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,818
Like, on Twitch.tv or
something like that.

385
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,787
My favorite streamers
started to get DDOS'd

386
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,523
and I wondered why that
was, looked into it.

387
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,359
Enjoyed learning my
network fundamentals.

388
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,393
Pushed further and further.

389
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,062
Started looking into security.

390
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,331
Had a couple of friends
that were already

391
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,533
into forensics and
incident response.

392
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,204
Had a couple of chats
with those people,

393
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,606
and I've always wanted
to catch the bad guy.

394
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,909
So, that's how I got into it.

395
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,580
In terms of tips, do you mean
for getting into security,

396
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,880
or into forensics, or?

397
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,852
(mumbles))

398
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,694
I would say look for
people on Twitter.

399
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,129
There's a lot of
people out there that

400
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,697
are willing to
help mentor people.

401
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:24,570
Tony Robinson, da_667 on
Twitter, he's taught me so much.

402
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,171
He's given me a lot of his time.

403
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,575
But yeah, I mainly
just talk to people.

404
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,710
Just use Google, basically.

405
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,545
I just look around,
figure it out.

406
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,516
My university's taught me
nothing in terms of forensics.

407
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,218
My whole course,
my whole degree,

408
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,420
is essentially just Cisco, so.

409
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,722
Forensics is all on me.

410
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,091
- Excellent, well
thanks very much Sev.

411
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,293
Really good to have
you on, appreciate it.

412
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,396
(intense soft music)
