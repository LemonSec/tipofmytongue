1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:04,304
(dramatic instrumental music)

2
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,415
- So, for those that don't
know, I'm not Kyle Maxwell.

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:19,218
So if you were looking in
your handy dandy guide there,

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,954
Kyle was gonna give
an outstanding talk

5
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,924
on analytic biases and proper
thinking and proper analysis.

6
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,026
And I tried to keep something

7
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,194
that's along the analysis line.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,163
Little known fact, I actually
submitted this paper,

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,398
or submitted this presentation

10
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:34,067
about 4 1/2 months
ago, during the CFP.

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,404
They said, "That's ridiculous,
the DNC hasn't been hacked.

12
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,706
"We're definitely not
accepting this paper."

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,274
And so, lo and behold,

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,877
Kyle ended up not
being able to make it,

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,246
due to some death in the family,

16
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,514
as you may have seen on Twitter.

17
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,049
And I went ahead
and pinch-hit it.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,650
Again, good thing this is ready.

19
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,919
I had the foresight to
know this was gonna happen

20
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,453
and we were all ready to go.

21
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,089
Of course, that's obviously BS.

22
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,390
Who am I?

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,625
You don't care about
any of this, right?

24
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,859
I love coming to
conferences, though.

25
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,094
That's why I'm out here

26
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,228
and I just happen to
be out here for the...

27
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,998
(beeping)

28
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay, well, look,
bottom line here,

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,935
the only thing we can conclude

30
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,437
is that the Russians
do not want you

31
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,505
to see this presentation,
right (audience laughs)?

32
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,107
If there's anything that I know,

33
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,443
it's the Russians don't
want you to see this.

34
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,844
So, okay, look.

35
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,782
- [Man On PA] False alarm,
no evacuation is required.

36
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,018
- No evacuation's required,
thank goodness, okay.

37
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,553
So, you can sit in your seats.

38
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,089
Nobody will spontaneously
combust, we are set.

39
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,090
Okay, so look, the agenda.

40
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,924
Why do we care?

41
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,859
What are we doing here?

42
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,360
Yeah, this is neat
to talk about,

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,929
but do we really have any
business implications here?

44
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,264
Overview of the hack.

45
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,598
Some of you may not have
read about this yet.

46
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,900
It's still fairly new.

47
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,302
TTPs that we know
to have been used,

48
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,204
talk about some of
the final metadata

49
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,505
from the exfiltrated documents,

50
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,841
'cause it's, to be
fair, it's pretty cool.

51
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,808
Then we're gonna
talk a little bit

52
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:50,143
about false flag opportunities.

53
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,845
I'm not saying this
is a false flag,

54
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,881
but if you wanted to conduct
a false flag operation,

55
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,517
meaning you wanted to
blame it on somebody else,

56
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,884
could you do it?

57
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,753
And, before we're done,
I'm gonna reveal to you

58
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,590
my super secret,
never-before-known,

59
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,293
by anybody in the room, I
think, my APT hacker handle.

60
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,096
So you guys will be
the first to see it.

61
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,265
So, again, why do we care?

62
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,233
Suppose your organization's
concerned with politics?

63
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,603
And I deal with
this a lot with my,

64
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,539
I deal with this a lot
with a lot of my clients,

65
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,006
whether they're
concerned with politics,

66
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,943
or foreign policy,
or you name it.

67
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,278
They see something in
the news and they say,

68
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,114
"Look, could this happen to us?

69
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,350
"How does this apply to us?

70
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,319
"How sure are we about this
particular attribution?"

71
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,220
Let's say we have some
business dealings in Russia

72
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,990
and we believe
Russia's trying to,

73
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,993
I don't know, influence the
outcome of the election,

74
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,528
they wanna know how
strong is the link.

75
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:45,131
And so, and then the whole
Guccifer 2.0 thing comes out.

76
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,634
If you guys haven't
heard of Guccifer 2.0,

77
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:52,605
essentially, he's, he, she,
some individual on the net

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,242
essentially is claiming
credit for, lone credit,

79
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,310
for hacking the DNC
and stealing documents.

80
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,879
And so, we'll talk a
little bit about that,

81
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,649
but leadership sees this
Guccifer 2.0 character

82
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,551
and they're worried
about these lone actors.

83
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,286
They're like, look, you know,

84
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,755
if a single actor, not
a state-sponsored actor,

85
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,557
but a single guy in
his mom's basement,

86
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,191
'cause that's what we
all picture, right?

87
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,028
Some 30-something
dude in underwear, in
his mom's basement,

88
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,131
chugging away on
Pepsi and Cheetos.

89
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,600
If he can do this, are
we worried as well?

90
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,101
Should we be worried as well?

91
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,137
So, again, this is where we
come in and threat intel,

92
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,639
and take a look at, overall,
what's been reported,

93
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,309
what can we confirm,
what do we look and go,

94
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,611
(screeches) that's a
little suspicious, right?

95
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,179
And then we come to
our own conclusions,

96
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:37,717
as we talk about in 5784, which
I'm proud to be a part of.

97
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,652
So, again, they're looking at,

98
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,321
Leadership's asking what can
we find out about the hack?

99
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,790
So, the attack timeline.

100
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,626
14 June, DNC hack was announced
more or less by Crowdstrike.

101
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,898
Guccifer 2.0 takes
credit on 15 June,

102
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:56,102
and Russia publicly denies
involvement at the same time.

103
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,303
They famously proclaimed,

104
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,539
"Maybe somebody
forgot the password."

105
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,807
To the DNC?

106
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,475
I'm not quite sure how
that works, but cool.

107
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,346
So, the DNC had a password,
maybe somebody forgot it.

108
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:10,049
Guccifer 2.0 releases more
documents on 18 and 21 June.

109
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,952
20 June, Threatgeek
posts some findings

110
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,654
from some of their
malware analysis.

111
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,891
On 20 June, Guccifer 2.0 opens
up DMs for media inquiries.

112
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,660
He's like, "Hey, I'm on Twitter.

113
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,161
"You wanna talk to me,
you got questions."

114
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,596
"I'm not a Russian puppet.

115
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,398
"You got questions, just DM me."

116
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,667
He's like, "I'm not
gonna answer everybody,

117
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,167
"I'm only gonna answer
real media contact.

118
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,104
"But if you got questions,
you just let me know."

119
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,239
This is kind of a
little bit brazen

120
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,775
for somebody who's
hacked the DNC and all,

121
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,743
but hey, rock on, right?

122
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,211
So, that's our timeline,

123
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,580
the timeline of the attack
as we know it so far.

124
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,015
As you read the
Crowdstrike post,

125
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,350
and I certainly
recommend that you do,

126
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,619
it's well put together,

127
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,589
take a look there and you'll
see that they've been hit for,

128
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,658
the DNC, has been
hit for some time.

129
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,394
And, as you know, in
these, I say some time,

130
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,828
meaning more than a year.

131
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,330
And if you do forensics,

132
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,465
you already know that, as
that timeline increases,

133
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,869
it gets harder and harder to
pin down an exact zero date,

134
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,673
or an exact zero patient
and time of infection,

135
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,408
and it gets harder and
harder to pin down.

136
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,511
So, I think details
will continue to
emerge here over time.

137
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,147
Guccifer comes out, he says,

138
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,150
"Look, I really, really
dislike Crowdstrike."

139
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,186
Says something about
sophisticated hacker groups.

140
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,520
When was the last time

141
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:22,322
it wasn't a sophisticated
hacker group?

142
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,556
Does anybody ever say,

143
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,758
"Hey, we were hacked
by total skiddies

144
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,561
"because we left the password
posted on our website.

145
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:29,762
"Totally shouldn't
have done that!"

146
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,097
Nope, it's always
sophisticated, right?

147
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:33,198
And so, again,
sophisticated, good to go.

148
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,370
Yep, he says, very pleased
they value my skills so highly.

149
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,972
It was easy, and
shame on Crowdstrike,

150
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,876
and wow, okay, he's really
mad at Crowdstrike, right?

151
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,412
Look, Crowdstrike kinda
comes back and says,

152
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,647
"Hey, we get it, all right?

153
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,784
"We have evidence that there's
two separate Russian groups

154
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,286
"in the network,

155
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,288
"and this Guccifer 2.0 guy
may be a Russian puppet.

156
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,890
"We don't know, but we
stand by our analysis,"

157
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,392
essentially is the gist of this.

158
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,760
And this really is
where executives get in,

159
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,562
and this isn't a
hypothetical call.

160
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,530
I actually have two
emails already about this

161
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,698
from different clients that
I work with at Rendition,

162
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,168
the company or small
consultancy that we own,

163
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,104
asking us, hey, what's
the impact on this

164
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,871
and how strongly do we believe

165
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,741
this attribution and analysis?

166
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,209
And so, it's not a hypothetical

167
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,111
that your execs might
actually care about this.

168
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,378
Depending on the
industry that they're in,

169
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,713
they definitely do.

170
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,181
As we begin talking
about the attribution.

171
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,317
First off, attribution's hard.

172
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,619
And I tried to make it a little
bit easier earlier this year

173
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,421
when I launched whohackedus.com.

174
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,056
Sadly, I forgot a
screenshot here.

175
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,157
But if you're ever having
an attribution problem,

176
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,960
just go out to whohackedus.com,

177
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,128
and you'll get a
random attribution,

178
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,264
complete with a random
state-sponsored group

179
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,932
that is clearly made up.

180
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,901
Despite this, however,
I've had three,

181
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,104
count them, three
offers to buy API keys

182
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,707
to this particular
service, right?

183
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,977
Again, I didn't use that here,

184
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,212
but some other attribution
considerations.

185
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,348
TTPs used by the attacker.

186
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,417
We look at the specific
malware that's used,

187
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,917
certainly malware
characteristics.

188
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,554
There's no substitute for
a good reverse engineer.

189
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,589
And then we look at command
and control domains,

190
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,558
IP addresses, and
other infrastructure,

191
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,493
and certainly there's
a bunch more stuff

192
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:10,695
that we can throw in here,
but I only have 30 minutes,

193
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,932
so we gotta pick it up here.

194
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,600
Talking about
validating attribution,

195
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,602
because in this case, I'm
not starting from scratch.

196
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,969
We're not the
starting attribution,

197
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,274
we're valuating another
analyst's attribution.

198
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,844
We have observable facts,
and then we have analyses.

199
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,346
And any time you
have the two of those

200
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,649
when you're trying to
validate the attribution,

201
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,685
you put more weight on the
things that you can observe,

202
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,387
the things that you can confirm,

203
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,588
versus the actual analysis.

204
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:38,191
And we saw this going
into the Gulf War.

205
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,493
There was some postmortem
done on the Gulf War,

206
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,897
where, goodness, Colin
Powell got up in the UN,

207
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,200
got in front of the UN and
said, "Definitely DWMD!"

208
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,235
And they went back and looked
at some of the analysis.

209
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,703
And in some cases,

210
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,638
people that were making
these analytical judgments,

211
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,608
were five, six, and in
one case, seven steps,

212
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,243
removed from actual
intelligence.

213
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,880
So there were people
building analytic conclusions

214
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,050
on nothing other than
others' analytic conclusions.

215
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,651
This is like playing
the telephone game

216
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,686
in the fourth grade, right?

217
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,253
So, not a good place to be.

218
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,857
You don't know what went into
those analytic conclusions.

219
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,258
And so, observable facts,

220
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,926
always better than
others' analyses.

221
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,394
Look, of course,

222
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,763
of course it's always
experts that build these,

223
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:21,267
but you may or may not wanna
always place blind trust.

224
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,534
Does everybody know this guy?

225
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,103
He's the Ancient Aliens
guy on History Channel.

226
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,305
He's an expert too,

227
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:29,642
but some of his conclusions
we might call into question.

228
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,877
Okay, so the diamond model.

229
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,278
If you're not familiar
with the diamond model,

230
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,080
you should absolutely be
familiar with the diamond model.

231
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,516
We use it all the time
in threat intelligence.

232
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,949
What we do here, essentially,

233
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,187
is break out how our
indicators are being used.

234
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,722
We've got the
adversary, capability,

235
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,155
infrastructure, and victim.

236
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,558
What do we know?

237
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,661
As far as the adversary,
Russia, maybe some other actor.

238
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,496
Getting into the capabilities,

239
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,430
we know that they do a lot
of living off of the land

240
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,301
but as far as malware goes
heavily using PowerShell,

241
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,604
We also see the SeaDaddy
implant, X-Agent and X-tunnel.

242
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,206
And these have previously
been identified

243
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,041
to be other Russian groups.

244
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,276
We take a look at IP addresses

245
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,343
and we've got a litany of them.

246
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,578
Number of IP addresses

247
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,880
that were passed over by
the CrowdStrike folks.

248
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,115
Definitely appreciate

249
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,449
that no domain name is
passed over by the way,

250
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,151
just IP addresses in the report.

251
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,055
And then we know that they
compromised an email server,

252
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,156
as well as an IRC
or a chat server.

253
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,660
Because they talk about
being able to see both email

254
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,694
as well as their private
messages being sent.

255
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:23,963
So maybe a link server.

256
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,365
We don't have that level
of detail to understand.

257
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,634
But this is kind of where
we sit in our diamond model.

258
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,237
I always find this
interesting to plot one,

259
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,339
because it's a great one
slider for your executives,

260
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,875
executives love pictures,
they love pictures.

261
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,176
Give them a picture, right?

262
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,178
And we separated
out our IOCs here

263
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,981
and what do we know
about the actual event?

264
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,983
I'm not using any
conclusions here,

265
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,919
just simply pulling stuff
out of the actual report,

266
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,890
and plotting against
the diamond model.

267
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,358
So what do we know?

268
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,693
Capabilities, we know they
used credential theft.

269
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,194
We know they did
living off of the land.

270
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,096
Again, didn't deploy
a lot of malware,

271
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,365
tried to use things that were
already there on the machine.

272
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,800
We know from infrastructure,

273
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,568
they had multiple IP
addresses in the malware.

274
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,371
Domains weren't specified
though in CrowdStrike reporting.

275
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,906
Victims, we know DNC
email and chat servers.

276
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,241
Certainly there
were other servers

277
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,611
and other machines
compromised during the event.

278
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,046
You know I picked a
couple of IP addresses

279
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,514
to start playing with this.

280
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,950
And the one that was great,
probably the best here,

281
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,652
we went into RecordedFuture.

282
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,520
And if you're not
using RecordedFuture
you're missing out.

283
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,555
It is an outstanding tool.

284
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,324
If you haven't used it
before, we teach it.

285
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,327
In fact, you get a free
license, free demo license,

286
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,597
fully functional for 30
days in the 578 course.

287
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,132
The RecordedFuture
immediately tells me,

288
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:37,469
"Hey, inside of the slash
24 with 255 IP addresses,

289
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,939
"there are 13 other IP addresses

290
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,574
"that have a weird
reputation score."

291
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,076
Meaning a high risk score.

292
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,647
And so, now I'm not necessarily
saying that that means

293
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,115
that this IP address is bad

294
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,484
or that confirms the CrowdStrike
reporting or any of that.

295
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,519
But it's kinda like,

296
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,688
we occasionally do SANS
in Baltimore right?

297
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,590
Anybody been in Baltimore?

298
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,991
I'm sorry, do you live
there fresh hands?

299
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,259
- No.
- Okay.

300
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,527
Then I would be
extra sorry right?

301
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,995
So that you've been
to Baltimore, right?

302
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,530
And occasionally go to one
of those places in Baltimore.

303
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,232
This is one of those places
I could've been to Baltimore

304
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,933
and people are like,
"Do I admit to that?"

305
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,603
And anyway, you go to
some places in Baltimore

306
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,938
and it's good, but there's
other areas of Baltimore

307
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,141
that look a lot like a show
I saw on HBO called The Wire.

308
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,910
And it's true to form.

309
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,646
So I look here, and this subnet
looks a lot like The Wire.

310
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,619
Because I'm not necessarily
saying that it's all bad,

311
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,355
but again there's a
lot going on here.

312
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,891
And again, one of
our IP addresses,

313
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,559
again immediately
pivoting over here,

314
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,327
this saves me a ton
of searching here.

315
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,430
And again, this isn't some
super advanced query I did.

316
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,997
I just popped it in, and bam!

317
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,332
I'm starting to believe here

318
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,501
that we've got some
other reporting.

319
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,602
The good thing to know

320
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:46,072
is that this
particular .134 address

321
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,273
didn't have any reporting on it

322
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,075
prior to the CrowdStrike report.

323
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,812
But these other IP addresses
have lots of reporting on them,

324
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:55,081
lots of reporting on them prior
to the CrowdStrike report.

325
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,349
That gives us some level of

326
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,585
who is using these IP
addresses previously

327
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,853
and in a number of cases

328
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,521
where there have been
attributions done,

329
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,491
several these IP
addresses have been seen

330
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,259
used by Russian actors.

331
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,161
Now does this mean that

332
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,296
that's a Russian
actor that's using it?

333
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,466
No, not necessarily right?

334
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,501
It turns out that
this is out in Romania

335
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,669
and you can go, I'm sure,

336
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,603
buy some virtual
server out in Romania

337
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,740
and use one of these
IPv4 addresses.

338
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,942
But it's starting to fit right?

339
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,910
We're looking at
alignment of TTPs.

340
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,746
And again, if we've
seen Russian actors

341
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,814
coming out of this
net block before,

342
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,415
might they also
continue to come out?

343
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,086
Does that lend some credence
to that .134 address?

344
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,058
And I come back to Domain
Tools, another outstanding tool.

345
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,828
I say, "Hey, tell me about
maybe domains that we've seen

346
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:46,899
"parked on .134, no passive
DNS either by the way."

347
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,735
Domain tool says, "No Bueno,
I got nothing for you."

348
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,270
And this is a pretty rare thing

349
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,073
with domain tools at this
point for reverse IP.

350
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,910
Most often, I've
got something pinned

351
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,346
to that particular IP
address at some point.

352
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,147
Some domains been
assigned there.

353
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,414
I've got nothing here,

354
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,650
so nothing that I can
pivot off of there.

355
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,919
Look, being from Romania
isn't necessarily bad,

356
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,288
but it's certainly not one
of my top 10 countries,

357
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,391
where I like good
legitimate IP traffic from,

358
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,060
or expect good legitimate
IP traffic from.

359
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,762
I kinda like do
a lot of teaching

360
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,098
a couple times a
year, over in India.

361
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,367
I know where I can eat, I
know where I can't eat, right?

362
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,569
So eat in the
western restaurants,

363
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,305
don't eat at that food
cart down the way.

364
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,607
Chad Tolbert tried this
a couple of years ago.

365
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,177
Was not a success.

366
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,512
Likewise here, I know
about good IP traffic

367
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,047
and maybe questionable
IP traffic.

368
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,950
Again, questionable IP traffic

369
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,785
(groans) I'm not profiling here,

370
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,454
but tends to come from
places like Romania.

371
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,725
We start talking
about TTP's earlier.

372
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,327
We started looking at Seaduke.

373
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,296
I pulled up some old
reporting on Seaduke,

374
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,866
actually pivoted off of
this from RecordedFuture,

375
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:58,170
and Seaduke was using
compromised websites

376
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,805
for command and control.

377
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,574
So the attackers
weren't registering
any of their own IPS,

378
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,575
they weren't registering
any of their own domains.

379
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:04,977
They were using IP addresses

380
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,478
that have been
previously compromised

381
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,546
or had compromised sites on them

382
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,982
for their command and control.

383
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,750
This is actually really
smart from their perspective,

384
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,386
because I can't do any
reverse who is at this point.

385
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,920
Renders that useless.

386
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,957
I'm looking for things like,
hoping to find things like,

387
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,391
email addresses or names, or,

388
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,194
you guys know about
the San Diego affair?

389
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,661
You may hear about
this a couple years.

390
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,632
It's actually more than a
couple years ago, five or six.

391
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,367
We had a particular
group of attackers

392
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,401
who was misspelling
the word San Diego.

393
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,372
And they were consistently
misspelling the word San Diego.

394
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:37,075
And they were misspelling it
San Digu, instead of San Diego.

395
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,412
And so, as new domain
registrations came in,

396
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,249
from San Digu,
California, right,

397
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,717
they were immediately
known to be bad.

398
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,185
And that's the kind of stuff
we're looking for here.

399
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,786
People are creatures of habit.

400
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,321
Your attackers are
creatures of habit,

401
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,458
as well as they're
trained for good opsec,

402
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,659
they're gonna screw it up.

403
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,261
That's just the
reality of the game.

404
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,728
And so, took a look
here and I said,

405
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,131
"Well what else is Seaduke
fencing using before?"

406
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,933
Primarily compromised servers.

407
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,568
"Okay, well, good!"

408
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,869
I don't have that
level of detail on the
CrowdStrike report,

409
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,204
but pivoting off here,

410
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,372
trying to understand
some more about the TTPs

411
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:10,242
of the supposed adversaries,
this certainly helps.

412
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,977
And pull another IP address.

413
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,579
Great, it's in China.

414
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,414
I talked a minute
ago about Romania

415
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,149
and that being like
bad food poisoning.

416
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,286
I think this is like guaranteed
salmonella here, right?

417
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,520
At the end of the day,

418
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,822
I'm not necessarily
profiling China here,

419
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,958
I'm totally profiling
China right?

420
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,795
It's almost the
blame-it-on-China
kinda complex here.

421
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,031
So, a great run on the
web server, outstanding!

422
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,534
You know I go back to
mnemonic trying to get,

423
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,704
so sorry virustotal first,
trying to get some passive DNS

424
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,104
and I even bouncing mnemonic

425
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,008
with a couple API keys
punched in and I got nothing.

426
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,411
And that makes me a sad panda.

427
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,646
But okay, moving forward right?

428
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,448
Why am I focusing on
the command and control?

429
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,683
Because if the attackers

430
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,484
are purchasing the
command and control,

431
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,720
there may be some kind
of thing I can follow.

432
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,488
Whether it's a
registration email,

433
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,023
where is the domain parked,

434
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,293
do they tend to buy servers
from a particular location?

435
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,795
I think we know the
answer to that by the way.

436
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,664
We saw that big net block
full of servers in Romania.

437
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,067
Looks pretty promising there.

438
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,837
If we see compromised, only
compromised servers being used,

439
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,073
if there's something in common,

440
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,310
we may be able to identify
a particular capability.

441
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,579
Perhaps all the compromised
domains are running Drupal

442
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,146
or WordPress.

443
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,682
Oh, was anybody out
here, a few years ago,

444
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,052
the DFIR summit when DrupalCon
was going on next door?

445
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,654
So, like DrupalCon was going on,

446
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,055
I think you were in
the elevator with me.

447
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,256
Were you not, when
this happened?

448
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,591
You know yeah, anyway.

449
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,428
So a couple developers
there from DrupalCon

450
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,064
and I see that one's wearing
like big DrupalCon badge

451
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,166
and I've been down on
music row, and anyway,

452
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,268
you guys know how
that goes right?

453
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,871
I'm coming back up to the hotel

454
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,140
and sure enough I say,
"Hey, hey you, you,

455
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,375
"Are you one of the
devs for Drupal?"

456
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,877
She's like, "I am a core
developer for Drupal."

457
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,878
I'm like, "Ah, that's awesome!

458
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,114
"I got a thank you
for what you do."

459
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,281
She's like, "Are you a fan?"

460
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,349
I'm like, "As a
matter of fact, I am."

461
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,685
She's like, "Do you
use our software?"

462
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,353
I'm like, "I do not."

463
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,655
She's like, "What do you mean?"

464
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,889
I said, "Well,

465
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,759
"I'm running an incident
response consultancy."

466
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,761
I said, "You're putting
my kid through college."

467
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,763
(everyone laughing)

468
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,165
Anyway, and then I
arrived at my door.

469
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:17,202
The little (dings), and I
was like, "You know anyway."

470
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,172
So it was one of those
wonderful moments

471
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,141
just too good to pass up.

472
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,209
Last, maybe they're all
running something like Drupal

473
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,812
or WordPress, or something
where we can kind of identify

474
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,581
a capability that the
the attackers might have.

475
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,449
This gives us some
insight into TTPs.

476
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,386
But if they are
all running Drupal,

477
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,754
it's not like I'm gonna
go scan the internet

478
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,255
for all Drupal
servers and assume

479
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,991
that those are all C2 domains.

480
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,158
Still, gives me some insight

481
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,027
into the attackers capabilities.

482
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,529
One of the malware artifacts.

483
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,564
So these may say something
about the attacker as well,

484
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,799
they're easy to fake.

485
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,100
We do it all the
time at rendition.

486
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,168
Black Hills does it.

487
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,968
They actually had a tool

488
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,938
that used to put
APT related strings

489
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,240
into their existing binaries.

490
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,509
Ed Skoudis has been
talking about for years

491
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,111
that connections to
the Stuxnet code.

492
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,279
They just can't be trusted,

493
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,448
it's too easy to
false flag this stuff.

494
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:05,984
PowerShell is just text, too
easy to copy coding styles.

495
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,220
But as we talk about some of
these artifacts of interest,

496
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,490
there's a fairly unique OpenSSL
library that's being used.

497
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,125
It's actually
Heartbleed-vulnerable.

498
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,428
In one of the X-Tunnel
samples, it's been identified.

499
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,197
It was also
identified being seen.

500
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,064
On one of the IP
addresses hard-coded in

501
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,302
was used in the German
parliament attack, in 2015.

502
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,204
FireEye reported that
that was linked to Russia.

503
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,905
So must be good.

504
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,139
What about document metadata?

505
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,908
Some of that doesn't
seem quite right.

506
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,642
Something seems just
a little bit off.

507
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,946
'Cause Guccifer 2.0 has
been releasing documents.

508
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,281
Can we take a look
at some of this,

509
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,685
last modified by, I'm sure
that's in the DNC, no problem.

510
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,088
It's total at a time at
two minutes with 231 pages

511
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,623
totally makes sense.

512
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,291
And then the company is GSA,

513
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,361
which I'm told is
an abbreviation for,

514
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,297
and I can't remember the
pronunciation of this,

515
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,766
but basically one of the
Russian intelligence services.

516
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,702
So rock on there.

517
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,170
What are some other
document metadata?

518
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,672
I love that Ernesto Che has
been involved in editing

519
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,375
or modifying some
of these documents.

520
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,512
You guys know Che right,
good old revolutionary dude.

521
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,447
Again, here we see the code
page being Windows Cyrillic.

522
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,985
Also doesn't quite
grok with a DNC there.

523
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,986
I don't even know
what that spells

524
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,955
'cause I don't read Cyrillic.

525
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,924
As far as false
flag opportunities,

526
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,259
look, PowerShell is easy.

527
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,161
We could be copying
that from other reports,

528
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,096
we could plant
malware artifacts.

529
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,365
We could plant
document metadata.

530
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,433
We could even use a social
media puppet account

531
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,370
with broken English kind
of like Guccifer 2.0.

532
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,840
We could try and
publicly discredit the
work of researchers.

533
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,108
Step back and think about

534
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,909
how difficult any
of that would be.

535
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,281
From where I sit, all
actually sounds pretty easy.

536
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,549
Actually let's talk about that.

537
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,050
How are false-flag
PowerShell right?

538
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,485
One of the things
that we identified,

539
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,219
or the CrowdStrike identified,

540
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,390
they said, "Hey look, we took
a look at this PowerShell,

541
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,226
"and the key, the
encryption key,

542
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:57,095
"has been seen
being used before."

543
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,032
And I'm not necessarily
knocking CrowdStrike's analysis.

544
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,135
When we have good TTP
alignment, we should map that.

545
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:04,770
But let's keep in the
front of our minds

546
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,004
that you too could use this key.

547
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,943
This key, this one
right here, this key,

548
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,378
and I'm not saying like
a random key, this key,

549
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,280
and you two then
could be attributed,

550
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,517
based on that same logic,
to a Russian APT group.

551
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,819
Just throwing that out there.

552
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,722
What about false
flag puppet blogs?

553
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:27,359
I thought, "Man somebody
could go register

554
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,895
"the WordPress blog guccifer3."

555
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,163
I thought about that.

556
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,765
Turns out somebody
already had that idea.

557
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,601
So I had to register guccifer4.

558
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,737
(audience laughs) So that's
my new secret APT hacker name,

559
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,038
guccifer4.

560
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:42,708
Totally wasn't Russia,
death to polio, right?

561
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,811
And Putin guaranteed me
that if I convinced you guys

562
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,780
that it wasn't Russia, that
it was totally not Russia,

563
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,916
he'd let me ride a shark, right?

564
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,552
And so guccifer4.wordpress.com.

565
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,620
The original site that's
leaking all the documents

566
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,456
is guccifer2.wordpress.com.

567
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,293
I figure guccifer4 is at least
twice as cool as guccifer2,

568
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,494
math right?

569
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,196
And so, how hard would it be

570
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,764
to create a false-flag
puppet blog?

571
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,933
I did it during the Hadoop
forensics presentation,

572
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,401
which, by the way was awesome.

573
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,571
When that thing is released
on video, go watch that.

574
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,007
So what about Alternative
Competing Hypotheses, ACH?

575
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,410
We don't have time to
cover the full ACH.

576
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,280
By the way, if you're
not doing ACH, do ACH.

577
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,116
If you don't know how to do
ACH, come to Forensics578,

578
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,818
we teach Alternative
Competing Hypotheses.

579
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,920
This keeps me out
of so much trouble

580
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,455
when I'm presenting
to the board,

581
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,126
board, boards, the board,
whoever, right, the management.

582
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,297
Because they ask, "Did you
think about...", whatever it is,

583
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,199
and the answer is nine
times out of ten, yes.

584
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,335
But only because we did ACH.

585
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,736
And not only did
I think about it,

586
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,272
but I have the good mathematical
evidence to show you.

587
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,774
Say mathematical,

588
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,475
of course, we're assigning
some qualitative pieces there.

589
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,744
But I can say, "No,

590
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,147
"that particular theory
doesn't really line up as well.

591
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,149
"The evidence doesn't
support it as well

592
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,949
"as the particular theory
that we want with."

593
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,886
And so I can throw out
a couple of theories.

594
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,120
Russia, it was Russia.

595
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,822
Guccifer 2.0 was a puppet.

596
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,956
Maybe there's another
unknown state actor.

597
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,192
I've got a null hypothesis

598
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,194
says there was never any
compromise at the DNC.

599
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,462
I find that highly unlikely,

600
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,665
but we throw it up there
as the null hypothesis.

601
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,401
Maybe the docs leaked by
Guccifer 2.0 are all fake.

602
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,803
Guccifer 2 is real,

603
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,305
and the Russians hacked
the DNC independently.

604
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,208
So the question really
is at the end of the day,

605
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,243
'cause I talked about the
possibility for false flags,

606
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,479
and I said clearly
this is easy to do.

607
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,315
We even talked about how you
can write your own PowerShell

608
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,919
Russian malware today and be
attributed by CrowdStrike too.

609
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,821
And I'm not knocking CrowdStrike
let me be clear on this,

610
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:40,391
but be attributed by
CrowdStrike as a Russian actor,

611
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,995
maybe a fancy bear, or cosy
bear, whichever bear you want.

612
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,864
You know the question
is, who did it?

613
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,367
I certainly don't know.

614
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,268
We don't have enough evidence
to say with any certainty.

615
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,003
But based on the publicly
available evidence,

616
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,639
I have to say probably
that guy, right?

617
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,009
Well good, that's all I've got.

618
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,711
Any questions before we break?

619
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,713
None?

620
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,581
Nobody has any questions about?

621
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,782
Awesome I like it.

622
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,149
Okay, well, hey I
appreciate your time.

623
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,651
Thank you very much.

624
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,654
(audience applause)
