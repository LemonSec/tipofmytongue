1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,269
(bright music)

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,913
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,953
- Well, hopefully, you didn't
set the bar too high for me.

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,158
I'm Rebekah Brown,
@PDXBek on the Twitters.

5
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,293
PDX is the airport
code for Portland.

6
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,727
I figured everybody knew that,

7
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,730
and apparently, people
have been very confused,

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,134
so that little mystery's solved.

9
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,970
I'm the intelligence
lead for Rapid7.

10
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,039
I started there
in about October.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,874
But before that, I
was a gunnery sergeant

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,842
in United States Marine Corps.

13
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,245
Ooh-ra, I think I
heard one up here.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,115
I was a Chinese
cryptologic linguist

15
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,286
and a network warfare analyst
starting at about 2001,

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,088
when we were fighting two
wars in the Middle East

17
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,891
and they had no clue
what to do with me.

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,926
I'm pretty sure I was
a mistake. (chuckles)

19
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,196
But, it came in handy coming
in, starting at around 2006,

20
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,598
when we realized just
how big of a threat

21
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,469
our military networks were
facing from foreign actors,

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,538
and I finished up my career
right before I left active duty

23
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,407
as the operations chief
for the Marine Corps'

24
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,542
Offensive Cyber Unit.

25
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,411
After I left, I did some work

26
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,280
with the Department
of Homeland Security.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,715
I helped with some of
the policy development,

28
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,818
providing that
intelligence perspective,

29
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,188
and I was also a liaison to
some state and local governments

30
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,125
who, turns out, were
just as, if not more,

31
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,995
vulnerable and under attack
as the federal government was.

32
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,165
So, throughout my whole
career and all this kind of,

33
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,468
different aspects and
different jobs that I'd done,

34
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,037
I was still an intelligence
analyst at heart.

35
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,942
And that means that I
often got this question:

36
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,644
what would you say you do here?

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,481
Actually, I got it
about 45 minutes ago

38
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,181
when I was sitting in the
lobby, practicing this.

39
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,852
Somebody came up and said,
"Oh you're at Rapid7.

40
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,253
"What do you do?"

41
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,422
I get it a lot, I get
it from my parents,

42
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,824
who I'm pretty sure are sad

43
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,926
that I'm not actually an
engineer like both of them are.

44
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,996
From my kids, who, you know,

45
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,965
when I go and talk
at like, parent day,

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,602
those poor little second graders
are so confused right now,

47
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,003
but really, really
scared of the internet,

48
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,071
so my job is done.

49
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,341
Occasionally, from
my co-workers.

50
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,878
Not too often, from my
boss, but, still sometimes.

51
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,412
And from talking to a
lot of my other friends

52
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,816
who are in the cyber
threat intelligence field.

53
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,218
I realize, this is,
it's a common problem.

54
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,186
Thankfully, it's not just
me they're asking about.

55
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,222
It's kind of the
universal thing.

56
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,491
People hear about cyber
threat intelligence.

57
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,859
It sounds like a good thing.

58
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,794
It has the word intelligence
in it, so clearly,

59
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,830
everyone should be
doing it, right?

60
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,367
But then, the next
question is usually,

61
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,335
what does it actually do?

62
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,739
What am I supposed to be
doing with this intelligence?

63
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,275
Because, right now,
I've got a threat feed,

64
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,242
and it's great, it's awesome.

65
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,609
We paid so much money for it.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,447
But, it generated so
many false positives

67
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,682
that we actually turned it off,

68
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,882
but we don't wanna
tell our management

69
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,984
because we still
want them, you know,

70
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,586
getting to give us more money.

71
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,189
But, what is threat
intelligence supposed to do?

72
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,356
How do I use it?

73
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,561
And so, those of us
intelligence professionals,

74
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,363
when facing this question,
this is what we do.

75
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,199
We throw words at it.

76
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,000
We come up with
a new definition.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,103
We use all the best words,
the best words, I swear.

78
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,106
Actually, our words
are not that good

79
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,209
because they don't
make much sense.

80
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,011
And it kind of runs the
spectrum from, you know,

81
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,114
"Oh, well, cyber
threat intelligence is

82
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,184
"refined,
evidence-based knowledge

83
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,221
"with context and, you
know, indications to..."

84
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,722
I actually read
once, somebody said,

85
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,191
threat intelligence is a
list of IKEA addresses.

86
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,826
So, we run the whole gamut.

87
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,662
And we're not really
doing a very good job

88
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,331
of explaining what it is,

89
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:53,833
but the bigger problem is that

90
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,969
that wasn't actually
the question.

91
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,004
The question is,
what does it do?

92
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,505
How do I use it?

93
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,641
And that's not something
we talk about a lot.

94
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,941
And when we do talk about it,

95
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,179
we tend to give our
specific use case.

96
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,048
Oh, yeah, you aggregate
a bunch of threat feeds,

97
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,717
and then you run it and
connect it through your SIM.

98
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,086
Maybe you need a threat
intelligence platform.

99
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,856
And then, you do context, and
then magic, and it's great.

100
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,394
That doesn't actually work
though, especially if the person

101
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,829
who is trying to use
threat intelligence

102
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,965
isn't actually using
it in a SOC use case.

103
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,235
The reason we have
such hard problem

104
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:32,572
explaining how to use
threat intelligence

105
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,808
is because it depends.

106
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,978
If you ask the question,
how do I use this?

107
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,480
What am I supposed
to do with it?

108
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,183
It depends on your mission, on
your goals, on your company.

109
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,653
It depends on your
maturity and your size.

110
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,422
It depends on your ability
to respond to threats.

111
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,627
To answer the question,

112
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,529
what do I do with
threat intelligence?

113
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,731
Here's my answer.

114
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,735
There's more than one way to
utilize threat intelligence,

115
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:03,870
and I think that's something

116
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,673
that's very important
to understand

117
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,710
because if you are taking,
you've talked to somebody,

118
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,811
you've talked to a vendor
or a friend, an expert.

119
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,747
You've brought it a consultant,
and they're gonna tell you,

120
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,883
"Oh, here's how you should
use threat intelligence."

121
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,383
And they give you
the whole set-up

122
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:21,621
for using intelligence to
generate alerts for your SOC,

123
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,955
but you actually
wanted to use it

124
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,694
for responding to incidents,
it's not gonna work for you.

125
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,197
You need to understand that

126
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,099
not only are there
different ways to use it,

127
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,435
but the applications and
all of the components

128
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,337
that go into that intelligence

129
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,305
are gonna be very,
very different.

130
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,540
They're not just a
little different.

131
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,508
In a lot of cases,
they're totally,

132
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,378
like, completely
different use cases,

133
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,913
so you need to understand that.

134
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,717
So, here's the
intelligence cycle.

135
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:53,119
Has anybody seen the
intelligence cycle, anybody?

136
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,188
Yay, it's great, we love it.

137
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,025
A lot of applications
of threat intelligence

138
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,893
are based around this
intelligence cycle,

139
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,160
the intelligence process.

140
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,765
This came from, it's the Joint
Intelligence Publication.

141
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,768
I think they ripped
it off from the army,

142
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,303
but I'm okay with
that as a marine.

143
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,070
I can deal sometimes.

144
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,773
Sometimes they do
some good stuff.

145
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,244
But this supposed to outline
the process you go through

146
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,947
when you are using intelligence.

147
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,382
It starts with
planning and direction,

148
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,084
which some people
call requirements.

149
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,786
You then have to
collect intelligence

150
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,688
based off of those requirements.

151
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,057
You have to do some sort of
processing and exploitation

152
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,759
because a lot of the
stuff you're collecting,

153
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,928
especially in its raw
format, isn't very usable.

154
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,897
You need to do analysis
and production.

155
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,200
You can't just use information
that you're gathering

156
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,236
and apply it to a situation.

157
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,637
You have to actually do
some sort of analysis

158
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,806
that's specific
to your use case.

159
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,841
And then, dissemination
and integration

160
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,478
into products or actions or
operations or whatever it is.

161
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,515
And then, around all of that
is evaluation and feedback,

162
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,750
meaning, you're
gonna do this again.

163
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,684
It's a cycle.

164
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,219
It's not a one-time thing.

165
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,423
So, you need to be evaluating
and providing that feedback.

166
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,027
This cycle works
well in some cases.

167
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,597
The general concept
is sound, it's good.

168
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,468
And maybe safe for
the SOC use case,

169
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,736
where you're gonna
be generating rules

170
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,604
and alerting on
things, this is good.

171
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,339
You know, you're set
up around a mission,

172
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,008
SOC is your mission.

173
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,810
And cool, I know what
I'm supposed to do.

174
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,044
I have my requirements.

175
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,579
I'm gonna collect some
intelligence on it.

176
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,648
I'm gonna analyze it, and
I'm gonna integrate it

177
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,650
into my system so
it generates alerts,

178
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,152
and then I'm gonna fine-tune
it, and that's great.

179
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,957
But, a lot of people in here
deal with incident response.

180
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,359
And how often do you get
to go into an incident

181
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,195
and say, cool, I
finished step two.

182
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,330
I'm gonna go to step three.

183
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,597
Step two is done.

184
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,600
I don't have to think
about that ever again.

185
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,435
That doesn't happen very often.

186
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,604
It's not a one and done,

187
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,139
it's not a step one,
step two, step three,

188
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,708
and then, start it over again.

189
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,410
It looks more like this.

190
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,948
And I love this version
of the intelligence cycle.

191
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,051
This is Robert Clark's
target-centric intelligence,

192
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,620
and the concept is,
it's not a one and done.

193
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,623
It's not a, you know,
step by step by step.

194
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,825
It's more of a process.

195
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,994
So, the target in this case,
if you're thinking about it,

196
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,096
it's a compromise or a breach

197
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,499
or an incident that
you're responding to.

198
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,267
That's always at the center,

199
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,369
and that's not always
gonna stay the same.

200
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,938
When you first go
into an incident,

201
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,207
and you're responding
to it, you need to know,

202
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,642
okay, what is the situation?

203
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,477
Why did you, why do we
think that there's a breach?

204
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,845
Why do we think that
something happened?

205
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,181
And you evaluate it,
and you analyze it,

206
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,583
and that's when you come
up with your requirements.

207
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:38,851
This is what I need to know,

208
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,486
this is what I need
more information on.

209
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,688
And that's when you
then go into collection.

210
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,192
We think of collection,
traditionally,

211
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,228
as pulling in
information from outside,

212
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,030
but in the case of incident
response, a lot of times,

213
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,732
it's pulling your
internal information.

214
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,434
It's pulling information
from logs, data,

215
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,803
from users, from your assets,
and that sort of information,

216
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,307
so you need to pull all of that
out, and then analyze that.

217
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:04,110
And once you do that, you
now have new information,

218
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,612
and that changes the way
that your target looks,

219
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,180
that changes the situation
that you had yesterday

220
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,717
or 10 minutes ago, and then
you have to do that again.

221
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,752
Okay, well now we
have, you know,

222
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,021
we answer some of
these questions.

223
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,290
Now, we have more questions.

224
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,158
Is this what we needed?

225
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,626
Do we need more information?

226
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,694
Do we have a bigger problem
than we thought we did?

227
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,197
And again, with
incident response,

228
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,067
because nothing is
truly that easy,

229
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,170
oftentimes, it looks like this.

230
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,674
We thought we were dealing
with a phishing campaign.

231
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,141
Somebody got a phishing email.

232
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,476
Okay, let's step
through the process

233
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,678
of how we're gonna analyze this,

234
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,112
what information do we need?

235
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,447
Who do we need to
tell about this?

236
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,884
And oh, wow, okay, it
executed some malware.

237
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,019
And oh, hey, we have no
network segmentation,

238
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,522
so not only is it in our
administrative environment,

239
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,024
but it actually made it
into our retail environment.

240
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,394
Rather than one target,
you now have three targets,

241
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,697
and you have to do
different requirements,

242
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,266
different collection, different
analysis and dissemination

243
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,001
on all of those
different targets,

244
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,536
sometimes at the same time.

245
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,406
So, as I kind of step
through this process

246
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,709
and try to answer the
question for my own team,

247
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,111
what do you do, how
are you supporting us?

248
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,914
I realize that I
can't just tell them,

249
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,682
"Oh, hey, I've got, you
know, stepping through this

250
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,184
"intelligence cycle,

251
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:20,386
"and I'm going to do some
collection and some analysis

252
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,488
"and tell you what
you need to know."

253
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,123
It turned into
this feedback loop.

254
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,625
We're constantly in contact.

255
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,326
They're constantly shooting
me whatever things they find,

256
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,561
and I'm giving them information

257
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,396
that helps them
find more things,

258
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,897
which then means that they give
me more things to look into,

259
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:36,435
and it's a lengthy
process, but it works.

260
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,740
And my intelligence
cycle, which I spent,

261
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,008
you know, a decade of my life

262
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,777
believing was the way
we did intelligence,

263
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,145
started looking like this.

264
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,815
I know, it's crazy.

265
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,718
You don't just have a circle.

266
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:57,689
You have cycles of cycles and
you have different targets.

267
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,659
You have different
centers of that universe,

268
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,696
and they all have different
apartments swirling around them.

269
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,731
And if you're only
zoomed in on yours,

270
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,134
on that one small one,
if you're thinking,

271
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,602
"Oh, cool, I know what
threat intelligence is.

272
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,137
"I'm gonna get a threat feed,"

273
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,604
you're missing so much
of the bigger picture

274
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,174
as to how this all
ties in together.

275
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,346
So, I actually visualize
this in my head now.

276
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,248
Once I get a concept in my
head, it doesn't go away,

277
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,316
and I'm a visual person.

278
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,818
Has anybody seen Ender's Game?

279
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,154
The new one.

280
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,588
The book was great,
I loved the book.

281
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,389
It's actually on the
commandant's reading list

282
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,857
in the Marine Corps.

283
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,291
But in the movie,

284
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,227
they have this 3D
rendering of the universe,

285
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,829
and Ender's like,
swiping things away,

286
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,329
and pulling things close to him,

287
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,833
and that's literally how I
picture threat intelligence.

288
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,935
Okay, my SOC is having trouble

289
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,204
because I've given
them information that's

290
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,473
resulting in a million
false positives.

291
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,907
Okay, I need to pivot here.

292
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,509
What went wrong in this system?

293
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,711
Is my collection bad?

294
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,179
Is my analysis bad?

295
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,680
Is something wrong with
the actual integration

296
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,382
of the intelligence?

297
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,282
Is it a technology problem?

298
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,451
Is it a me problem?

299
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,186
Sometimes, it's a me problem.

300
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,388
How do I need to
reevaluate that?

301
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,656
And then, when
there's something,

302
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,491
an incident pops up
that needs support,

303
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,827
I have to back away from
that way of thinking

304
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,597
about threat intelligence as
a feed and collection source,

305
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,434
and I have to say, okay,
where am I in this cycle?

306
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,702
You know, what
collection do they need?

307
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,337
Is it internal or
is it external?

308
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,607
And yes, I sometimes
use hand gestures

309
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,675
and they all think I'm a wacko.

310
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,008
It's alright, I don't mind.

311
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,580
But, so, what does
this mean for you?

312
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,249
Besides the fact that maybe,
Rebekah Brown's a little crazy?

313
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,217
I'm okay with that.

314
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,954
It means that if
you are responsible

315
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,488
for threat intelligence
in your organization,

316
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,858
or if you rely on
threat intelligence,

317
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,160
if you are being
asked to utilize it in

318
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,161
some way, shape, or form,
and it's not quite working,

319
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,032
then maybe it's because we're
thinking about it incorrectly.

320
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,102
And re-thinking and kind of,

321
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,672
re-scoping what
we're doing is hard.

322
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,008
It may add additional
work right now,

323
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,576
but it will pay off
in the long run,

324
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,311
because I'm a firm believer that

325
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,014
there's no way that we
can actually utilize

326
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,817
the full potential
of intelligence and
network security

327
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,521
until we actually understand
what it is we're trying to do.

328
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,992
So, first things first.

329
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,294
Identify your focus area.

330
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,696
This is when we get into the
discussion about requirements.

331
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,865
What are you actually
being asked to do?

332
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,701
What is threat intelligence
supposed to be doing for you?

333
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,104
Is it helping you with alerting?

334
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,673
Is it helping you
with investigations?

335
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,876
Is it helping make
business decisions?

336
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,012
The kind of, the strategic
level of threat intelligence

337
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,183
is often overlooked because
it's not in the weeds,

338
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,218
it's not often very technical.

339
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,620
It's looking at big picture:
what our threat actor's doing,

340
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,823
who are they targeting, how
are they going about it?

341
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,058
That's gonna help policy
makers make decisions

342
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,794
about where to invest time
and resources and security

343
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,362
in the long term.

344
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,064
But, it's a legitimate
application of
threat intelligence.

345
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:54,600
Are there others?

346
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,770
Are you doing something
new and creative that,

347
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,005
you know, no one's been
talking about before?

348
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,207
If you are, definitely, tell me,

349
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,108
'cause I would love to know.

350
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,846
Or, are you not really sure?

351
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,247
And your company just says,

352
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,649
"Hey, that threat intelligence
thing sounds awesome."

353
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,118
When I was doing
research for this,

354
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:14,720
I was actually kind of staggered

355
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,657
because threat intelligence
is one of the top priorities,

356
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,759
the top security
priorities for companies,

357
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,663
but an equal number of people
who say yes to the priority

358
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,467
say yeah, but it generates
too many false positives.

359
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,903
There's clearly a
disconnect there.

360
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:33,305
So, identifying what it is
that they're asking you to do

361
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,674
with threat intelligence
is critical,

362
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:40,246
and the next step is to
build your collection plan.

363
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,146
I think collection plans are,

364
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,782
I think one of...

365
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,954
I don't want to
say, underutilized,

366
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,924
but thinking about
collecting intelligence

367
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:55,327
in a systematic manner
is not really done.

368
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,830
It's usually, which
feed is cheapest?

369
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,498
Or, which one will
they let us buy?

370
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,702
Or, who has the best logos
and things like that?

371
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,004
We don't think about
it the way that

372
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,040
traditional intelligence
analysts do,

373
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,575
which is, I need something,
and I need to know

374
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,178
where to get that specific
thing that I need.

375
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,781
So, when you're trying to
build a collection plan,

376
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,916
the way we do it, I
use a spreadsheet.

377
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,518
I probably shouldn't
admit to that.

378
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,153
I should probably have
something way fancier,

379
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,321
but it's a spreadsheet.

380
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,592
And I list along the top all
of the things I want to know.

381
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
You know, if I'm gonna be doing,

382
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,095
supporting an investigation,

383
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:35,100
I want to know information
on malware samples.

384
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,236
I wanna know what they do.

385
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,670
I wanna know where
do they actually,

386
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,707
usually hide the malware files?

387
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,540
Like, what do they do?

388
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,709
How do they execute?

389
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,944
What are the different
aspects of that?

390
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,679
If I'm talking about
generating alerts,

391
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,281
I'm gonna want traditional,
you know, domains, IP's,

392
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,618
but also, what were
they related to?

393
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,619
Are they C2 nodes?

394
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,820
Are they hot points?

395
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,122
And I layout
everything that I want,

396
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,623
and then I go down the
list and say, cool,

397
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,159
what do I have now?

398
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,627
Through my internal resources,

399
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,462
through some open-source
collection, what do I have?

400
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,331
Cool, I've got a lot of IP's.

401
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,433
I've got a lot of IP's
that are related to

402
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,970
financial, financial crime.

403
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,871
Okay, I've got that, but
I don't have anything

404
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,406
that's really
related to kind of,

405
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,308
more advanced intellectual
property, so that's a gap.

406
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,210
I have a gap there,
and I need to find out

407
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,311
who can meet that gap.

408
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,982
Is it information that's
internal or external?

409
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,249
A lot of times, especially when

410
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,151
you're doing incident response,

411
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,954
you're gonna need internal
information from your systems,

412
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,122
and if you don't have that,

413
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,556
then don't even
bother looking outside

414
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,025
for external collection.

415
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,693
You need to know what you
have within your own networks.

416
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,996
And then, what can you act on?

417
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,697
A lot of times, I wish,

418
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,868
you know, I know, oh, this
particular type of intelligence,

419
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,070
you know, if I can track
this actor's TTP's,

420
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,905
and like, I find
information on those TTP's,

421
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,074
then I'll know
everything about them.

422
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,675
But I actually have
no way on this network

423
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,112
to act on that information.

424
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,880
I can't do anything
with this intelligence,

425
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,915
so it should not
be my top priority.

426
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,751
But, once you step through
this process of what do I need,

427
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,953
what do I have, and
where are my gaps?

428
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,021
That's when you should actually
move to start looking for

429
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,290
external intelligence.

430
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,929
So, when you're evaluating
external sources

431
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,599
and this, this is kind
of across the board.

432
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,467
This will work for
any application of
threat intelligence.

433
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,104
You're gonna need the
actual intelligence.

434
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,440
So, where does it come from?

435
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,142
And I'm not asking for
sources and methods.

436
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,376
If there are vendors in here,

437
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,145
I don't need to know
your secret protocols,

438
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,879
or, you know, what
your username is

439
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,114
in this particular doc form.

440
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,383
That's cool, I don't
need to know that.

441
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,419
But, if I'm going to
act on it as a consumer,

442
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,920
as a user of this intelligence,

443
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,689
I need to know whether this is
coming from criminal forums,

444
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,026
or whether it's coming from
a honey pot that you run.

445
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,128
Does it come from
previous incidents?

446
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,098
That, all those details of
where it actually comes from,

447
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,000
help me as the
analyst understand

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,202
how I can use it and
my confidence in it.

449
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,273
What types of threat
groups does it cover?

450
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,876
Everybody wants all,
you know, the ATP's.

451
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,978
You wanna know their TTP's,

452
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,146
their reports
coming out on them.

453
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,380
We're so excited to read those

454
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,283
and figure out if
they're hacking us.

455
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,351
But a lot of times,
the real threat is

456
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,720
that financially-motivated
criminal.

457
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,590
So, if you spend all your money,

458
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,524
you spend all your
budget on ATP's

459
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,296
who aren't a huge portion
of your threat profile,

460
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,331
then you're gonna miss a lot
of the other intelligence

461
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,332
that might actually
help you understand

462
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,001
the true threats facing you.

463
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,270
So, figure out, what type
of groups does it cover?

464
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,173
And again, whether you're
talking open source,

465
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,976
or whether you're talking to
a vendor, ask these questions.

466
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,112
And if they won't answer,
and if they can't answer,

467
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,615
you're probably best
looking somewhere else.

468
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,150
What types of information
does it include,

469
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,452
and again, that helps you
fill out that spreadsheet

470
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,854
or that map or whatever
it is that you have

471
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,223
to make sure that you're
getting the full range

472
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,491
of everything that you need.

473
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,658
And then, are you gonna use this

474
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,128
as a primary source
or enrichment?

475
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,495
The threat intelligence data,

476
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,730
there's a couple of different
ways you can use it.

477
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,098
You can use it as
that primary source.

478
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,634
It can be, you know, I'm
going to alert on this.

479
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,035
I'm gonna look for this.

480
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,704
I'm gonna really, truly
understand what this threat is,

481
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,438
and then, there's enrichment.

482
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,575
That's data, like,
the DNS information,

483
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,311
or whether it's in the sinkhole,
or something like that.

484
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,480
Something, what you
can't really alert on,

485
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,748
but when you have an indicator,

486
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:10,983
and you wanna get
more information,

487
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,650
that's intelligence as well,

488
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,753
and those come from
different sources

489
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,922
than, again, a lot of
primary indicators.

490
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,993
And don't discount open
source intelligence!

491
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,663
A lot of people... (scoffs)

492
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,565
So, open source generates
a lot of false positives

493
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,767
if you just plug it in, if
you just treat it like a feed

494
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,536
and plug it in to your SIM.

495
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,405
But then again, so there's a
lot of commercial intelligence.

496
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,974
I've been there, I've
seen a lot of it.

497
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,243
It all has to do with
whether you've gone

498
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:39,778
through that collection
plan process,

499
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,480
and identified whether or not

500
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,116
you're viewing the
right intelligence.

501
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,584
And open source intelligence,

502
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,554
there's actually a lot of really
good information out there,

503
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,789
and some people are very,
very good at saying,

504
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,791
this is where this
information came from.

505
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,028
I run a honey pot, and it's
running these applications,

506
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,664
and it's looking for threats
against these five ports.

507
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,333
I would far rather use an
open source intelligence feed

508
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,268
where I know what
is coming from,

509
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,770
and I know what
threats to look for,

510
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,706
than a mysterious, can't tell
you, super secret squirrel,

511
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,210
I promise this stuff is
really good threat feed

512
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,212
because I don't know
how to handle it.

513
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,581
I might have trust issues,

514
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:18,750
but it's proven,

515
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,886
it's proven to be true that
something you know about

516
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,522
is more valuable than
something you don't know about.

517
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,092
Open source takes work.

518
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,727
There's a lot of people
out there who have

519
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:32,798
put in a lot of the work to
making it as useful as it can.

520
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,700
So, please, come talk to us.

521
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,803
Scott up here, single you out.

522
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,173
And we've had a lot of good
discussions about what actually,

523
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,841
what you need to look for

524
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,876
for using open source
intelligence and how
to best apply it.

525
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,912
And that's a whole
'nother talk in itself,

526
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,448
but come find people, and
we can definitely help you,

527
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,049
point you in the
right direction.

528
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,352
And then, pick a model.

529
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,989
(laughs) I honestly think that

530
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,291
next to which threat feed
is the best, you know,

531
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,260
my threat feed can beat
up your threat feed,

532
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,795
my analytic model can beat
up your analytic model

533
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,764
is the next one.

534
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,532
Some people swear by
the diamond model.

535
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,735
Some people, you know, F3EAD.

536
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,901
Some people, they've
got their own.

537
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,804
I like the target-centric model.

538
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:14,806
But it really depends on
what you're comfortable with

539
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,575
and what's gonna work
for your use case.

540
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,910
So, if again, if you are
trying to use the diamond model

541
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,947
for, you know,
alerting in your SOC,

542
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,216
it's probably not the
best application of it,

543
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:27,319
but it would be good for
say, incident response.

544
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,723
So, review these models,
because, again, please,

545
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,659
please, please, please
do your own analysis

546
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,927
on your intelligence.

547
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,295
And these models will
help you figure out

548
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,764
what you're truly doing.

549
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,565
So, figure out which model's
gonna work best for you.

550
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,504
And, again, some might be
better for certain situations.

551
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:51,543
So, (laughs) sticking with
my whole astronomy thing.

552
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,181
My kids and I argue
about Pluto a lot,

553
00:21:56,181 --> 00:22:01,086
'cause when I was a kid, back
in 1994, Pluto was a planet,

554
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,187
and I loved Pluto,
'cause it was like,

555
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,122
the little planet that could.

556
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,192
But then my kids told me,

557
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,994
"Hey, you know, Pluto's not
actually a planet anymore.

558
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,363
"And we've learned more,
and it is not real."

559
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,435
So, I don't accept
that, but fast forward,

560
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,303
we have the New
Horizons mission.

561
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,838
It took a lot of
time to get there,

562
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,873
but all of the sudden now,
we have a clearer picture

563
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:26,712
of what this faraway, distant
thing that we know is there,

564
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,081
we don't know much about
it, about what it is.

565
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,183
And now I'm told
it's a dwarf planet,

566
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,919
which to me, is a planet
still, so I was right.

567
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,723
But the analogy is this.

568
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,625
There are some times
when what you're doing

569
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,562
isn't gonna be
very clear to you,

570
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,963
but that doesn't
mean to discount it,

571
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,365
doesn't mean, write it off.

572
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,600
If right now, you're struggling
with threat intelligence

573
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,735
because you are trying to

574
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,105
use the same threat
feed for your SOC

575
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,107
that you do for
incident response,

576
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,709
the whole concept, the whole
thing of threat intelligence

577
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,779
is gonna look like that
little blurry 1994 Pluto,

578
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,180
because it doesn't
make a lot of sense,

579
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,416
and you're not quite
looking at it correctly.

580
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,319
But, if you're willing
to put in the work,

581
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,720
if you're willing
to take the time

582
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,222
to identify your requirements,

583
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,190
to talk to other
people who've used it

584
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,427
in similar situations,
in the end,

585
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,862
it's gonna get clearer
and clearer and clearer,

586
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,598
and hopefully,
one day, you know,

587
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,299
we won't have to
have this debate of,

588
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,869
is threat intelligence a
real thing or is it a fad?

589
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,538
Is it a buzz word or a hype,
or is it actually useful?

590
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,739
Because we would've
put in the work,

591
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,074
we would've taken the
time to figure out

592
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,209
how to actually use it.

593
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,612
So, that's all I
have for you today.

594
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,081
Any questions?

595
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,118
- [Man] I feel like
a lot of companies

596
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,486
look for external sources
for threat intelligence

597
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,722
when internally, you can,

598
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,257
there's a lot of
things you can get

599
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,025
from your internal sources
with threat intelligence.

600
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,560
You kind of talked
about, you know,

601
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,662
what good sources offer your
own threat intelligence,

602
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,197
whether it'd be like, you know,

603
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,366
grabbing processes
and baseline them,

604
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,968
or, you know, grabbing
IP's and baseline them,

605
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,571
and seeing, you know, what's
going on in your own network

606
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,805
to see like, for, you know

607
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,073
irregularities--
- Sure.

608
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,108
- Or anomalies.
- Sure.

609
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,676
So, I'm a firm believer that

610
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,379
internal intelligence is
probably the best place to start

611
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,048
because you automatically know
that it's applicable to you

612
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,950
because it came from you.

613
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,419
Incidents, previous incidents,

614
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,887
are a really,
really good source.

615
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,123
If you're not pulling all that
information out afterwards

616
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,593
and utilizing it in other areas,

617
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:26,064
again, you can use IOC's that
have come out of incidents

618
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,166
to alert on.

619
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,068
You can also use it just to
have a better understanding

620
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,737
of the types of threats
that are facing you,

621
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,206
and get a more realistic picture

622
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:37,074
of how you might need to
tune your security process.

623
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,944
Baselining is another
really good idea

624
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,781
because, especially with
more sophisticated actors,

625
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,649
and I feel like more and
more we're moving towards,

626
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,717
it's easy to be a
sophisticated actor.

627
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,420
They're not gonna use things

628
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,788
that are gonna
generate signatures.

629
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,456
They're not gonna
go from the same IP

630
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,957
that they did last week.

631
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,526
They're not gonna use the
exact same malware hash

632
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,961
that you can alert on
that they did last week.

633
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,697
So, baselining and
looking for anomalies,

634
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,167
looking for processes
that no one has ever run,

635
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,470
by a user who has
never in her life

636
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,706
downloaded her own
application and run it,

637
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,975
that's the type of thing
that you can look for

638
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:12,110
that will alert you
that something is,

639
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,812
something malicious is going on.

640
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,482
But that relies on
a good understanding
of your own network,

641
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,216
so that's kind of, one
of those precursors,

642
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:23,455
like don't try and use
attacker, you know,

643
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,358
attacker behavior analysis
if you don't know your users

644
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,792
and how they operate

645
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,328
because you won't really
know what the delta is there.

646
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,568
- [Announcer] Well, if
you liked Rebekah now,

647
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,803
- Oh dear.
- You might wanna know

648
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,072
that she's also now
a SANS instructor,

649
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,073
and also a co-author of FOR578,

650
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,311
which is the threat
intelligence course for SANS.

651
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,245
- Yes.

652
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,914
And so, if anybody is in the

653
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,515
threat intelligence
class after this,

654
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,552
I'll be sitting in
the back of the room.

655
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,153
So I'm looking forward
to a good class.

656
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,055
(bright music)

657
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:57,889
Thanks!
