1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,669
(intense music)

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:13,513
- Alright, thank you.

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,551
Thanks, thank you for coming

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,253
to have this
conversation with me.

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,058
I know that I think this
is last session of the day

6
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,192
before the Forecast Awards,

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,129
and then after that,
the networking event.

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,031
I'm looking forward
to spending some time

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,832
continuing this
conversation this evening

10
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:36,169
over some giant Jenga
or some Big Buck Hunter.

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:40,373
But being the last session of
the day, I'll dive right in

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,741
so we can move through this.

13
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,210
Myself, my name
is Austin Murphy.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,311
I'm the Director of
Incident Response

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,746
for Crowdstrike Services.

16
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,449
I'm responsible for
delivering forensics

17
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,352
and breach investigation
for our customers.

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,321
Before my time at
Crowdstrike, I was at EY

19
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,824
as an incident responder in
the advanced security center.

20
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,162
And before my time in the
private sector as a consultant,

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,297
I was in the Air Force as
a cybersecurity officer,

22
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:08,634
focusing on network attack
tactics development.

23
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:13,173
So from all of my time from
my undergrad through today

24
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,175
has been focused on some flavor

25
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,277
of computer network
attack or defense.

26
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,145
I've had the
opportunity to consult

27
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,247
with dozens of
different customers,

28
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,050
not only performing
breach investigation,

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,119
incident response work,
but also proactive work

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,190
and kind of assisting with
increasing the overall posture

31
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,627
of information
security strategy.

32
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:38,231
And it's an area that I'm
really passionate about.

33
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,933
and when I talk about
information ops,

34
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,268
to kind of break that
down a little bit,

35
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,837
what we're gonna talk about,

36
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:48,808
the components of an
information security strategy,

37
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,512
prevention, detection, response.

38
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,847
I kind of put
prevention over here

39
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,148
and say this is
the responsibility

40
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,383
of your infrastructure
and your architecture.

41
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,351
And then you've got
detection and response.

42
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,354
And that's the
responsibility of your team.

43
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,423
That's what I call security ops.

44
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:08,428
So, I think this
is a very important
component of a strategy

45
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,097
and it's also very
hard to do well,

46
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,500
and that's why I spend so much
time focusing in this space

47
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,001
and why I'm passionate about it.

48
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,905
And also why I wanna talk
today about having a frameowrk

49
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,006
to really kind of change the way

50
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,307
that we maybe think about this

51
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,510
and the way we kind of
plan our team around it.

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,644
So I'm gonna talk about this
threat detection framework

53
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,447
and talk about what it is.

54
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,885
At a high level, we'll talk
together about how to build one.

55
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,587
We're gonna talk about what
the values of having one

56
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:37,123
would be for your team
and what you're gonna get

57
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,658
out of having it.

58
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,827
In order to get started here,

59
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,463
what I'd like to ask
is everyone here,

60
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,734
I'm just gonna put some
quotes up on the screen

61
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,968
and I wanna kind of get
us all on the same page

62
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,203
talking about the
problems that we face.

63
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:52,805
So if you do me a
favor and just nod

64
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,140
if you agree with
these sentences.

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,409
We're just gonna put
a couple of quotes up

66
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,378
and just tell me if
you agree with these

67
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,180
when we're talking about
information security operations

68
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,017
and the challenge
of doing this well.

69
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,952
So I'd say, first, there's
no single technology

70
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,288
that's going to be
your silver bullet.

71
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,958
You're gonna be working with
different types of technology

72
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,793
and they kind of
need to play together

73
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,395
to have a successful strategy.

74
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,700
And the work of the folks
that are in the room here

75
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,903
and at the FIR Summit,
we're the practitioners,

76
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,138
we fundamentally speak
a different language

77
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,308
from business leadership.

78
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,876
And that can be
tricky to navigate,

79
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,813
but we definitely
use different words

80
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,881
to talk about the
problems that we face.

81
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,121
Vendors lie about the
things that they sell you.

82
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,891
Some, some.

83
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,630
Our networks are getting
more complicated,

84
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,001
BYOD, internet of things,
globalization, teleworking,

85
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,970
it's drastically
changing the way

86
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,504
we think about our networks.

87
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,106
The networks themselves are
getting more complicated,

88
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,475
and therefore, the
task of securing them

89
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,543
is also getting more
complicated as well,

90
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,513
and this getting
harder to do well.

91
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,417
PCI is not enough.

92
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,055
If we're talking
about a strategy

93
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:19,058
that involves people and
process and technology,

94
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,328
I would argue that the people
and the process components

95
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,964
are more important
than the actual tech.

96
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:28,034
That might be kind of counter
to what you may be hearing

97
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:33,039
if you're talking to your
resellers that are selling tech,

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,675
they're not selling
process and people,

99
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,810
but I think it's very
important that we focus

100
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,046
on people and the
process components.

101
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,416
And the final statement
here before we dive into it

102
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:48,320
that technology by
itself is not a strategy.

103
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,256
And I bring this up
and bring it home

104
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,791
because I've had
this conversation

105
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:56,796
with a lot of CSIOs where I
just kind of casually say,

106
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,599
"So tell me about what
you're doing. What's your

107
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,801
information strategy-
information security strategy

108
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,303
look like?"

109
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,271
To have them rattle off the
things that they've purchased.

110
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,307
They say, "well we've
got this product,

111
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,177
this network sensor, here's
the antivirus that we use.

112
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,313
And that's their strategy.

113
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,282
They don't talk about how these
capabilities are deployed,

114
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,084
they don't talk about how
their teams are using those

115
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,819
capabilities.

116
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,654
What kind of processes
they have in place.

117
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,690
How their teams are organized,
trained and equipped

118
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,261
in order to really bring the
capability to their customer

119
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,064
which is the business
to decrease risk.

120
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,100
And that is kind of the
heart of why I started to

121
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,436
kind of create this concept
of the threat detection

122
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,104
framework because I felt
like there was a gap

123
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,207
in the space for how we're
using technology to kind of

124
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:44,143
really decrease risk
to the business.

125
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,145
So that is what the TDF is.

126
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,650
It's an important concept
that allows us to kind of map

127
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,919
the various inputs that
we face in our process

128
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,222
to really get clarity of action.

129
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,957
So when the military --
every system that's developed

130
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,627
or improved upon has a
concept of operations

131
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,930
documentation, COPS.

132
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,967
What COPS is, it describes a
system from the vantage point

133
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,703
of those that will use the
system, and that's what your

134
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,638
sock is, it's a system, it's
a collection of processes

135
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,676
and the actors in this
process are your analysts.

136
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,479
So you have- they've got
inputs, they execute playbooks,

137
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:23,816
they handle incidents with the
goal of providing a service

138
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,818
to the customer which
is the business,

139
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,989
the business makes an
investment in the sock,

140
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,256
to get that risk reduction.

141
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,759
Kind of have to put it
at the macular layer,

142
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,962
how we think of the sock as
a system and how you know,

143
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,830
a collection of tools is
not going to get us there

144
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,298
by itself.

145
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,167
We need to kind of think
about this more holistically

146
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,236
from start to finish.

147
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,172
So as I kind of stated
in the previous slide,

148
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,007
that what we need is a
documentation framework

149
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,910
which will really kind of
connect us from the technology

150
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,980
that we have to the goals
that we want to achieve.

151
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,582
Aligned from kind of
what's important to our -

152
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,885
in our vertical in our business.

153
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,388
And allow us to really translate
that technical language

154
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,357
that we all speak about
the things that we do,

155
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,492
and map that to use
cases, kind of things that

156
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,995
are important to those
that pay our bills.

157
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,731
And that's gonna be
different for different types

158
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,232
of organizations.

159
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,401
An engineering organization
you know, might get a lot

160
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,970
of a value out of a
well tuned DLP solution,

161
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,206
but that might not really
be that important in

162
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,908
a retail space where
they're focused

163
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,276
on transaction processing.

164
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,647
Likewise, something like a
network based anomaly detection

165
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,783
system might be really
valuable in an ICS space,

166
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,519
but that's not probably gonna
be beneficial in something

167
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,458
more heterogeneous like
a university campus LAN.

168
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,929
So by really kind of focusing
on what matters to your

169
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,198
business, is how we kind
of unlock the value of the

170
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,700
technology that we purchased.

171
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,670
So to get started, and we're
gonna keep this really simple,

172
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,007
to get started we want to
really kind of think about this

173
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,844
to build a threat
detection framework,

174
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,679
and by the way I called a
threat detection framework

175
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,448
because if I submitted a
talk for the threat detection

176
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,317
Excel spreadsheet, they
wouldn't have accepted it.

177
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,086
(laughter)

178
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,855
So we start by basically
taking inventory of all the

179
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,624
sources of information
that we have available

180
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,159
to our analysts.

181
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,694
So that's if you have a sim
and you wanna start with all

182
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,829
your inputs, all your log
inputs that you can have

183
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,331
in your sim.

184
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,399
Think about the various panes
of glass that your analysts

185
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,035
use, the other tools that
they use, the other detection

186
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,138
systems that they have
available to them.

187
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,073
Also think about the things
that aren't traditionally

188
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:33,079
centralized or correlated like
your asset database from IT,

189
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,948
or change management,
account trouble anything,

190
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,083
anything that could be
of value to your analysts

191
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,084
you're gonna wanna
inventory that,

192
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,720
start by just creating a list.

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,890
And I'm not advocating
that we log all the things,

194
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,559
but if we wanna with a kind
of full canvas of everything

195
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,395
that we would have at our
disposal in order to have

196
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:52,064
a thoughtful conversation
about what needs to be logged,

197
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,498
correlated, and why.

198
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,069
Next, we're really gonna wanna
start to add some context,

199
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,141
and some definition around the
things that we have available

200
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,977
to us, and we gotta stop
mapping that to what we kind of

201
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,246
talk about as use
cases or detections.

202
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,848
So this is saying, "Okay, I've
got a log source, I've got

203
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,384
afennication logs, what
can I do with that,

204
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,754
how can I turn that
into a detection?"

205
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,623
This is not rocket science,
this is pretty straight forward.

206
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,159
Just kind of laying it down
and formally describing

207
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,627
what we already know we can
do with this type of stuff.

208
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:25,231
And we can look for brute force
attacks, count spray attacks

209
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,866
we can look for you know,
we can detect off of all

210
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,800
of these lovely things.

211
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,404
But we kind of start building
this out and at this phase,

212
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,074
its okay to have overlaps,
we're just kind of

213
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,809
brainstorming here, so
we'll have overlaps,

214
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,310
we'll have gaps.

215
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,779
You're gonna wanna talk about
all the things you currently

216
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,380
detect on, you're also gonna
wanna talk about all the things

217
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,883
you'd love to detect
on but maybe you can't.

218
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,484
So at this point were
just brainstorming still.

219
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,254
So thinking about the use
cases that you care about

220
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,491
to really kind of start
to build out a much larger

221
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,260
map of the things
that you can do.

222
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,330
This is supposed to be a bit
of an eye chart so don't worry

223
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,598
about if you can't see it.

224
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,498
I just kind of wanted to
give an example of how

225
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,570
this really can grow some
legs and start to become much

226
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,706
more involved as
you build things up.

227
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,574
You wanna be as granular
as you can with this,

228
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,409
and get very specific,

229
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,280
but also try to describe
your use cases in as plain

230
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,247
of language as you can
because this is gonna be your

231
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,651
Rosetta Stone for
talking to you know,

232
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:22,221
the other areas that
don't speak our language.

233
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,991
So this point in our exercise
we're gonna want to start

234
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,459
to do two things.

235
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,227
First we're gonna start
putting things into groups,

236
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,363
we wanna categorize things.

237
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,133
So if we have 50 use
cases or 100 use cases,

238
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,169
we wanna start to logically
group them either by

239
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,872
phases of the kill
chain or by the area

240
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:44,075
of the threat vector source

241
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,378
you know might be
another great--

242
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,180
it doesn't necessarily
matter what categories

243
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,282
you choose, but by putting
them into categories we've now

244
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:54,286
started to describe the
pillars that make up our

245
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,055
security monitoring strategy.

246
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,589
So we could say you know,
"What are you currently

247
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,125
looking for?"

248
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,494
You say, "Well we focus on
these four areas and that's

249
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,762
what we're doing," Right?

250
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,031
So now that we have all
of our use cases mapped

251
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:09,702
into categories, the next
thing we're gonna wanna do is

252
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,837
we're gonna map
them to playbooks.

253
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,740
In the talk right before
this one, Andrew gave a great

254
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,476
example of you know, the
value of a playbook when

255
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,611
we're talking about conducting

256
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,480
a mobile forensic investigation.

257
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,616
And that was great to see
that, and I think that that is

258
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,552
the type of content that
should be created for all

259
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,321
of the other things that
our sock is looking for.

260
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,923
So that we're really
once again focused on

261
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,593
connecting the dots from
the technical alert data

262
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,764
that we get, that comes in,
to you know, we use a use case

263
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:41,333
to add some value and
turn it into a detection,

264
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,669
and from that detection we
map it through the process

265
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,871
that our analysts are
gonna go through from

266
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,939
incident handling perspective.

267
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,776
This is also now the time that
we want to engage management,

268
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,445
right, so this is is
when we ask for inputs.

269
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,183
It's a very powerful
conversation once you have this,

270
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,117
to then kind of pause
and have a conversation

271
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,187
with leadership and
say, "Would you please

272
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,688
prioritize these?

273
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:06,192
What matters most to our
company and what would you

274
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,661
kind of put as last on the
list if we had to put these

275
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,896
from top to bottom
and rank order them?"

276
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,498
By doing that we're gonna
unlock a lot of value

277
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,001
in just kind of the relationship
between the way that

278
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,371
the executives think about the
sock that they've purchased,

279
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,675
and the way that the analysts
are kind of adding value

280
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,175
by executing strategy.

281
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,412
It kind of goes back to
that commanders intent,

282
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,148
or the ConOps document.

283
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,583
And we'll talk a little
bit more about the benefit

284
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,117
of that in a bit.

285
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,652
The other nice thing that
you get here is you start

286
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,455
to really outline where your
value comes from when we're

287
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,558
looking at the data
sources that we're having.

288
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,861
If you go through this whole
exercise and you find out

289
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:45,497
that you've purchased
some--that you're spending

290
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:48,968
thousands of dollars a
month on paying for hardware

291
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,905
and licensing because
you're retaining this very

292
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,207
granulated log source in
your sim and you find that

293
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,576
it doesn't map to any of your
use cases that you care about,

294
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,312
or it maps to use cases that
were deemed medium to low

295
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,282
priority, here's an
opportunity to actually become

296
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,584
a little bit more efficient
and maybe not renew

297
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,720
that purchase or reprioritize
where your budget is.

298
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,991
It's about thinking about
information security strategy

299
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,694
or security monitoring
strategy given the constraints

300
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,163
that are placed on you
by the fact that we all

301
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,631
have to work under a budget.

302
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,970
So I haven't answered the
question yet of what's the point

303
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,206
of all of this.

304
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:31,110
Right, so, Peter Drucker,
kind of management guru,

305
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,379
he was famous, he was the
first person to kind of

306
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,847
pen the quote,

307
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,316
"If you can't measure
it, you can't manage it."

308
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,119
When I think about
measuring the value of an

309
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,454
information security team
or a security ops team,

310
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,924
that's probably one of the
more challenging things

311
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,725
you can try and do,
and really describe--

312
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,863
answer the tough questions
of say, "Are we more secure

313
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,833
today than we were
six months ago?"

314
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,168
Now that's a question that
I've had to try to answer.

315
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm sure a lot of people
in this room have probably

316
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,305
tried to answer that, and
that's a tough one to answer.

317
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,842
Answering questions of,
"How many people do I need

318
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,310
to have in my sock?

319
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,178
Do I need to hire another
person, or do we have

320
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,214
too many people on staff?

321
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,583
What's the real value that
I'm getting as a return?

322
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,986
You know we're paying $1.7
million dollars worth of annual

323
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,055
expenditures for all
this licensing technology

324
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,424
and these people to sit in
a room with big screens,

325
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,694
and they work 24/7 and we
don't really know what they do,

326
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,228
how do you really measure that?"

327
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,531
And the other thing, while
we're on the second quote,

328
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,001
Rob Lee, not the one
that's here today,

329
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,203
the one that will
be here tomorrow,

330
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,539
a friend of mine at
ArchCON last year,

331
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,943
someone was giving a
presentation and he said that

332
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:41,313
the cyber kill chain
is not a valuable tool

333
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,348
for defending our networks
and it needs to be you know,

334
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,950
rethought, thrown away.

335
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,686
And Rob got all
upset, he stood up,

336
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,655
he kind of pounded his
fists on the table in the

337
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,390
middle of the
presentation, and he said,

338
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,292
"If you don't think
it's valuable, then
you don't understand

339
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,227
it, and you have no
business saying that,"

340
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,996
it was kind of a
heated exchange, he
was kind of excited,

341
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,632
"it's valuable because
we get inherent value off

342
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,234
of putting things into buckets."

343
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,371
And I didn't really
get it at the time.

344
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:09,909
Thought maybe he started
drinking a little too early

345
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,512
in the day, but it was
a couple weeks later,

346
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,979
I was chatting with him again
a second time and started

347
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,850
talking about that
again, and I kind of--

348
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,085
the light bulb went off for
me when I realized that--

349
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,587
if you can take these
things that are extremely

350
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,425
difficult to measure, because
by themselves there's no

351
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,795
quantitative -- there's
no quantifiable way
to evaluate them

352
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,465
if you can even just put
them into categories and into

353
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,401
a bucket, now it's
something you can count.

354
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,502
And if you can put in a bucket
and count it, then you can

355
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,106
count it again next quarter and
you can see what's different

356
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,475
And if you can count it over
quarter over time you can

357
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,411
trend things out, and you
can start to graph things,

358
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,179
and then you can start to
answer much more meaningful

359
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,381
questions about risk
where you talk about,

360
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,317
"Are we detecting things
earlier in the kill chain?

361
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,187
Are we detecting more
things that we care about?

362
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,256
And really kind of having
that meaningful conversation

363
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:01,526
about how to measure the
value of the investment that

364
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,629
we make when we have
a security ops team.

365
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,500
So the threat detection
framework at its core,

366
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,104
what we're trying to do with
this, is take all these inputs

367
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,807
that are very hard to measure,
they're constantly changing,

368
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,476
our goals are constantly moving,

369
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,612
and really focus them so
that we're using them for

370
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,448
the right purpose and that
we're using them aligned

371
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,386
with our customers, our
business priorities.

372
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:31,256
And this then becomes a lens
in which you kind of view

373
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,757
the world.

374
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,226
And I promise you if you go
through an exercise like this

375
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,196
you'll start to use this
framework as a way to really

376
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,332
solve a lot of other
problems about you know,

377
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,602
which tools do you need to
purchase, what's a better fit,

378
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,670
how many people do you
need to have on staff,

379
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,172
how do you report metrics?

380
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,674
You'll start to get a lot
of value out of this if you

381
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,175
start to kind of put this
together, it will become

382
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,977
kind of a window that you
view the world through.

383
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,747
So I'm gonna talk through
some of the benefits

384
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,717
of having this kind of in place.

385
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,319
And we already talked
about this a little bit

386
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,988
to kind of focus and
enumerate it a little bit.

387
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,224
The first benefit is getting
that executive sponsorship

388
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,791
for your program.

389
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:11,797
If you talk about your
capabilities using the language

390
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,666
that your management
cares about,

391
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,168
you're gonna unlock
a lot of value.

392
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,406
First off, on day one you're
gonna become more valuable

393
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,573
to your company because
you are now agreed on what

394
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,643
is important and now you
can focus those efforts

395
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,078
on the things that
you have been told

396
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,847
by your business are
important and deprioritize

397
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,349
the things that
are not important.

398
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,251
The second you're gonna be
more valuable simply because

399
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,485
you're better understood.

400
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,655
When you communicate
your capabilities using

401
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,322
someone else's language
that they speak,

402
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,993
they understand you better
and you're gonna win more

403
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,662
in negotiations you know
this becomes a tool for you

404
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,566
to advocate for budget, you
know make requests for change.

405
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,568
To kind of put it more simply,
if you're using someone

406
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,136
else's language to talk to them,

407
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,238
you're gonna be more
effective in getting

408
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,240
that support and sponsorship.

409
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,743
Two, is we talked a little
bit earlier about is metrics.

410
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,812
Its kind of a personal pet
peeve of mine the state

411
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,916
of security information
metrics is a little bit

412
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,417
disappointing to me.

413
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,588
And I think the reason is
that so many people that

414
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,424
are leaders in this space
that came from a traditional

415
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,692
career where they spent,

416
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,928
you know the last 20
years working in IT

417
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,196
and now they've kind
of switched over

418
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,298
to information security
and they're still living

419
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,234
in the world of service
oriented architecture and itel

420
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,971
and I've seen socks that are
reporting up to the sea sweet

421
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,174
board that are reporting
mean time between incident.

422
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,278
What does that
valuable, you know?

423
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,515
Meantime tramediation, number
of tickets in the queue were

424
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,352
like how many tickets were
closed per analysts per week

425
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,855
I don't think-- not only
would these types of metrics

426
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,158
in my opinion be potentially
useless, they can be harmful.

427
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,628
And I've seen that
you know--what you
measure it becomes

428
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,929
what you encourage.

429
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,134
So if you have a sock that's
incentivized closed tickets,

430
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,569
they're gonna close
more tickets faster.

431
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,305
And that doesn't really tell
us anything meaningful about

432
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,208
whether or not risk
has been reduced.

433
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,410
What are we doing here,
we're just closing tickets,

434
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,147
and if we have more
tickets to close,

435
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,648
is that good or bad?

436
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,482
I don't know.

437
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,452
But by having this TDF in
place this kind of allows us

438
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,420
to have a much more
meaningful conversation

439
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,989
about risk.

440
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,291
So if we're kind of defining
the things that we can count

441
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,560
and measuring how
they change over time,

442
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,162
we're not only talking
about the work that we do,

443
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,998
which is close
tickets, that's great,

444
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,233
but we can also talk about
the ways that we're improving

445
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,536
the overall capability.

446
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,739
So what I mean by that is
are we adding new detections

447
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,140
to the framework? Are we
thinking practically about

448
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,477
new ways to look for interesting
things to try and solve?

449
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,345
You know hunting
and active defense.

450
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:45,350
And also are we engaging
our automation teams and IT

451
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:50,322
to change our architecture so
that were actually decreasing

452
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,524
the crap that flows
through our sock?

453
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,560
You know if you're constantly
solving the same problem

454
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,562
over and over and over
you're kind of doing it wrong

455
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,264
and you should be focusing on
how can I automate this away,

456
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,667
how can we block -- prevent
this, so that our team

457
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,502
of humans can focus on
what humans do best,

458
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,072
you know, execute judgment
and think creatively.

459
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,408
Threat intelligence.

460
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,580
So most of the teams that I've
worked with are at a maturity

461
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,881
level where they can get some
good value out of threat intel

462
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:21,086
data but are probably not
mature enough to get real good

463
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:25,524
value out of actual threat
intel content which is kind of

464
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,093
the full contextualized report
about you know what an actors

465
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,630
gonna be interested in or
stories about how they're

466
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,633
conducting campaigns.

467
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,236
You know that's always
interesting to read
and always makes

468
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,104
for great water
cooler conversation,

469
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,674
but its not really until you
have a good document baseline

470
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,310
for what you're monitoring
for what you're detecting on

471
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,279
and how you're handling
incidents that you can really

472
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,848
kind of get to the heart
of how to get value

473
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,416
of threat intel data.

474
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,985
So I'm sure a lot of people
in this room for example,

475
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,521
maybe after the Sony
breach happened,

476
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,558
maybe had a member of the
board of directors or some

477
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,859
of the sea sweet ask
the question say,

478
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,462
"Well what would happen
if that happened here?"

479
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,131
you know I'm assuming that you
guys have had that question,

480
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,933
I've answered that
a couple of times,

481
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,770
If you don't have kind of a
documented baseline of what

482
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,339
you would do that's a really
difficult question to answer.

483
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,408
But if you have a threat
detection framework,

484
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,543
now this becomes an exercise
of kind of lining up what

485
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,478
we know about that
breach with what we're

486
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,847
currently looking for.

487
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,048
And you can have a
fantastic answer that says,

488
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,516
"Well here's what I
know about that breach,

489
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,753
there's six phases to that kill
chain and we have detections

490
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,222
right now in place that would
have alerted on three of them,

491
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,324
giving us an opportunity
to respond to that before

492
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,859
it ever became a problem."

493
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,128
Or maybe the answer is, "Nope,
we wouldn't have detected it,

494
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,696
we would have missed it."

495
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:42,701
But at least now you have
a tool that can be used

496
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:46,605
to move that conversation
forward that just doesn't end up

497
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,540
with you getting fired.

498
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,143
You know, so what we don't
have the ability to really

499
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,045
respond to something that
serious in our organization,

500
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,948
but if we made the following
changes if we introduce some

501
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,552
technology or if we made
some base line configurations

502
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,221
or if we introduce some
of these detections then

503
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,456
we would be set
up in the future.

504
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,792
Allows you to sort of
still use that story

505
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:11,797
to advance that state--
the posture of your team.

506
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,101
So kind of what I
described there,

507
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,838
with kind of a small example
of a table top exercise.

508
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,540
Sometimes you do
those impromptu,

509
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,841
when someone just casually asks,

510
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,642
"Say what would
happen if you know,

511
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,712
if Edward Snowden
did that here?"

512
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,146
Maybe you know maybe you don't,

513
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,749
you know that's kind of
a table top exercise.

514
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,753
But what I would kind of ask
is that you stop doing those

515
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,758
until you really have baseline
and have a TDF in place.

516
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,830
And I know of-- an example is
you wouldn't build a car --

517
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,167
you wouldn't build an
automobile and then put

518
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,336
a crash test dummy in
it, and then slam it into

519
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,004
a wall at 65 miles an hour,

520
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,439
without first having some
engineering blueprints

521
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,777
to understand how it crashed
and how to do it better.

522
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,546
And you wouldn't-- you know
the picture I have there

523
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,884
of a fire alarm-- you wouldn't
spend a million dollars

524
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,288
and wire up a building and
have a whole fire alarm system

525
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:12,991
with bells and whistles and
flashing lights and install it

526
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,193
on a weekend and then on
Monday morning just come in

527
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,062
and pull the thing and
see how people react,

528
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,530
you wouldn't do
that to be a waste.

529
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,466
I mean, it might be kind of
fun just to see everyone shriek

530
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,069
and run but you'd first kind
of wanna start by saying,

531
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,504
"Hey guys were gonna
baseline what we do here.

532
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,906
Here's exit A, here's exit B,

533
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,374
we got muster points
in the parking lot,

534
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,376
you go there you check
in with so-and-so,"

535
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,913
then you have the exercise
to see how well it worked.

536
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,948
And once you have a threat
detection framework kind of

537
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,785
documented out, once you
set your baseline up,

538
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,319
these become a
lot more valuable.

539
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,989
When you have a pen test,
when you have a red team,

540
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,224
if you have this
framework in place first,

541
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,260
now every finding that
they have along the way

542
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,097
is now a direct opportunity
for you to plug that hole

543
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,934
in a really meaningful tactical
way instead of just saying,

544
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,570
"Wow here's another report,
these guys destroyed us."

545
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,973
so you're gonna get a lot
more value out of these other

546
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,408
products that you
probably already --

547
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,943
these are other
exercises that you're

548
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,110
probably already doing.

549
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,951
Just like pen testing and
table top exercises I kind of

550
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,786
put them on the spectrum
of active defense,

551
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,889
and when I say active defense
I'm not talking about taking

552
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,692
offensive actions
against an attacker,

553
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:25,297
I'm talking about the
spectrum of things that you do

554
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,400
as a defender to proactively
think about defense.

555
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,402
So active defense
being the spectrum--

556
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,970
on the passive end of
the spectrum you have

557
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,438
your infrastructure,

558
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,140
you've got the things
that kind of automatically

559
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,209
block and tackle and
prevent and alert.

560
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,344
Then on the more active
side of the house,

561
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,849
you've got your things like
honey pots and canary tokens

562
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,484
and things like that.

563
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,218
Once again you probably
shouldn't be engaging in that

564
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,355
until you have a good
baseline of playbooks

565
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,991
and a detection framework in
place but once you have that

566
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,994
in place they can be a
really meaningful way for you

567
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,228
to fill gaps.

568
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,730
A really great way
for you to say like,

569
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,365
"Okay I know exactly what I'm
detecting and I can sprinkle

570
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:04,669
in these active defense measures
to fill the gaps to really

571
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,239
kind of give me a
much better strategy.

572
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,876
And the last thing that I'll
talk about from the benefit is

573
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,677
really on the hunting
side of the house.

574
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,514
And when I talk to people and
they tell me that they have

575
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,482
a hunting team or that
they're doing hunting,

576
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:21,353
I think about 75% of the time
they're actually not hunting

577
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,154
by kind of what I would
define as hunting.

578
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,856
You know when I ask
that follow up question,

579
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,758
"Okay so you're hunting,
what does that mean,

580
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,293
what are you actually doing?"

581
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,695
and I'll get kind of usually
one of two types of answers.

582
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:35,634
One is, "Well we got this
list of IP addresses and then

583
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:38,770
we take it and we proactively
hunt through our logs looking

584
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,272
for matches."

585
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,908
So that's not really hunting,
that's really just manually

586
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,177
doing what should be
automated by your sock.

587
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,246
And the second one is
the more technical side,

588
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:52,117
"We've got this script,
we run it across

589
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,519
the entire environment,
and we were gonna parse

590
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,754
a bunch of register keys,

591
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,987
we pull it back and we
stack it up and we look

592
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,323
for the anomalies."

593
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,958
I wouldn't say that's
hunting either.

594
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:04,462
Although this morning our
keynote speaker, Troy,

595
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,232
talked about doing that scale
in Azure, that's pretty cool.

596
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,302
That was-- its an important
thing to do but I think that

597
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,937
the hunting is really the
exercise that originally

598
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,973
gave you the first idea,

599
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,876
it's not when you're doing
it in a repeated manner.

600
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,345
Once you have that good
idea, you should find a way

601
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,714
to automate it and get it
into your detection stack,

602
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,283
so that your hunters can
think about the next idea,

603
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,185
and really be doing what
humans do well which

604
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,486
is thinking creatively
and executing judgment.

605
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:32,190
Hunting can be used within
your sock to fight off

606
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,159
analyst fatigue too,
that's another great tool,

607
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,494
if you've got someone who's
just closing tickets in a sock

608
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,798
and having them spend one day
out of every five thinking

609
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,434
creatively, planing,
briefing, executing

610
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,002
and conducting how
to debrief session

611
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:49,007
with the stated focus on
having the output of your hunt

612
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,012
be a way of automating
that and bringing that

613
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,682
into our automation and
kind of framework here.

614
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,017
And the output of
your automation --

615
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,552
obviously you've
got two outputs,

616
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,721
one is you have incidents that
are handled by your analysts,

617
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,155
that are gonna execute judgment,

618
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,625
and close out those by
using their playbooks,

619
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,159
but the second is metrics.

620
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,630
And the purpose of metrics
is to advocate for changes

621
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,565
in your infrastructure
so you can kind of

622
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,634
continuously push stuff--
in this model push it

623
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,268
to the right, 'cause pushing
it to the right means

624
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,472
decreasing cost and allowing
your people to think more

625
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,674
creatively and focus on the
things on the left which you

626
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,975
need people for.

627
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,177
Creatively thinking
about hunting,

628
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,212
and executing judgment.

629
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:28,747
So that's it.

630
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:33,518
That's really the concept of
the threat detection framework.

631
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,956
Kind of wraps it
up, any questions?

632
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,260
[Man In Audience] - So, we
have a hard time actually

633
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,163
documenting incidents, so what
sort of interface and what

634
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,766
sort of features should an
analyst have that they're gonna

635
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,468
want to interact with
to document an incident,

636
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:53,972
because typical ticket tracking
software really doesn't work

637
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,008
in order to generate the
metrics that should be?

638
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,911
- So let me talk about
documenting incident handling.

639
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,813
I think what you want to
do is first to find what

640
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,882
type of metrics you want
to create and back into it.

641
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,518
So some of the things I
always think are important

642
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,788
is thinking about what are
the categories that you would

643
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,157
wanna track from a
root cause perspective.

644
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,159
What would you wanna say
is your story at the end of

645
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,162
a quarter or the end
of a six month period?

646
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:21,132
You'd wanna say, "Well, we did
this number of these things,

647
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,967
and maybe we can talk
about the root cause."

648
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:27,972
The value of metrics
is to influence change.

649
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,076
So what you wanna have
is a story that says,

650
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,846
"If we made this
change, and paid--

651
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,315
you know made this investment
in our infrastructure,

652
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,584
this is what we might be able
to prevent in the future."

653
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,119
And then you're
talking in the terms of

654
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,088
risk reduction, cost reduction.

655
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,190
So then kind of start by what's
the story you wanna tell,

656
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,092
and then find a way to capture
that back into that from

657
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,527
a reporting perspective.

658
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,197
(intense music)
