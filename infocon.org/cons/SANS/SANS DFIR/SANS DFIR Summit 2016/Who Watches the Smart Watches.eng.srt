1
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,714
(applause)

2
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,182
- All right.

3
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,752
So obviously we're here to talk
about smart watch forensics,

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,887
cleverly titled, Who
Watches the Smart Watches?

5
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,523
Very, very brief list of topics

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,823
that we're gonna go over today.

7
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,927
Pretty much talking
about Pebble, the Band,

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,563
ways to protect your data,
future goals of mine,

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,332
and any questions if
we have time to go

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:33,933
through the actual questions.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:38,138
So as Dave very nicely said,
I am Brian Moran, I am indeed.

12
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,373
I spent 13 years active
duty in the Air Force.

13
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,176
10 of that was doing
mobile forensics

14
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,111
on official DFIR-type work.

15
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,081
I don't like
certifications at all.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,418
However, I am an unofficial
4Cast Award winner

17
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,385
for the Best Photoshop
of Lee Whitfield.

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,589
And I worked primarily,
through my Air Force stuff,

19
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,190
I worked at NSA Texas.

20
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,727
Which if you've never
been to NSA Texas,

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,128
looks the same as
it does in Maryland

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,263
just with ridiculously
oversized cowboy hats

23
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,100
on it because that's
everything in Texas.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,469
One of the places that I
also most recently worked

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,204
until, unfortunately,
yesterday, was I was

26
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,841
the campaign manager
for one Sarah Edwards.

27
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:17,509
We gave it a good fight,
we just unfortunately lost

28
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,912
to the FBI pretty much.

29
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,983
So throughout my talk I used
primarily Galaxy Note II,

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,853
I rooted it, running just
a base version of Android.

31
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,222
I used a Pebble Time, I
used the Microsoft Band,

32
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,789
and that was pretty much it

33
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,759
with the actual
hardware that I used.

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,628
For software, I used a
bunch of free applications

35
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,564
that once again, not
paying for anything,

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,365
just trying to make
it as open source

37
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,633
as completely as possible,

38
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,368
so that way I can
go through the data.

39
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,170
Just like we've talked
about many many times

40
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,440
throughout the summit so far is,

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,576
I want the raw data and I
want to go through it myself.

42
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,143
I don't necessarily
want to trust a tool

43
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,846
to tell me what the data is.

44
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,548
So there's just a listing
of the software that I used.

45
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,184
Thanks very much, Heather
Mahalik actually gave me

46
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,054
some iOS data from the
Pebble that I sent her.

47
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,424
She synced it with her
iPhone, so because of that,

48
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,793
it only cost me a couple
pairs of my awesome leggings

49
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,428
that I have to wear
since I had hip surgery

50
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,728
about a month ago.

51
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,232
And also, Heather
does not know this,

52
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,967
but let's make her,

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,703
let's make her next year
for Book of the Year.

54
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,239
Let's make that happen.
(applause)

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,275
Let's start right
now, and fortunately,

56
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,411
Heather and Hillary
both start with H

57
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,880
so they already
have a logo made.

58
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,548
I just had to throw a
couple of mustaches on it

59
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,616
and it was perfect.

60
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,484
Fantastic.

61
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,720
So, what was not used?

62
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,155
I didn't use Cellebrite at all

63
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,523
because I wanted to prove
that you could do it

64
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,691
for essentially,
pretty much free.

65
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,527
And during the course
of my presentation,

66
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,228
no lying-dormant cyber
pathogens were harmed.

67
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,832
So, once again, just
wanted to make sure that

68
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,600
throughout the course of
this it was all open source

69
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,668
and all completely,
as essentially

70
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,970
as open source as possible.

71
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,910
So I purposely chose the
Microsoft Band and the Pebble

72
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,279
because they actually had apps

73
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,549
for all of the different
operating systems on the phone.

74
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,117
I didn't want something
that was proprietary

75
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,852
like the Apple Watch
or the Samsung watch

76
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,687
because they're
primarily locked down

77
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,190
to work best with the
actual phone itself.

78
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,393
So wanted something that was
as cross-platform as possible.

79
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,929
So why would we
use smart watches?

80
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,464
Honestly, one of the
biggest reasons is

81
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,099
instead of having to pull
a phone out of your pocket,

82
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,667
you get a little
notification on your wrist

83
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,036
when something happens.

84
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,871
Like here, Stacey
sent me an email

85
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,140
about a fun poster that
she wanted me to see.

86
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,075
So of course I had
to open the poster

87
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,844
and this, in a slide,
pretty much describes me.

88
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,179
I am a peacock leprechaun.

89
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,915
Like there is no really
better description of me

90
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,218
than a peacock leprechaun.

91
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,619
So of course, Stacey
had to send that to me.

92
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,856
We also use smart watches
for fitness tracking.

93
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,424
A lot people in
the United States

94
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,659
and pretty much
all over the world

95
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,894
are becoming more and
more morbidly obese.

96
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,431
So we buy smart watches
because we want to get in shape

97
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,368
like brotato chip Lee Whitfield,
workin' out at the gym.

98
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,037
So, that's why we
would use smart watches

99
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:00,907
because one day I hope to
be as ripped and shredded

100
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,376
as brotato chip Lee Whitfield.

101
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,211
Maybe you wanna
go for a bike ride

102
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,879
on the weekend.
(audience laughs)

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,083
Maybe you just feel the
need to go for a bike ride.

104
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,418
You can use your smart
watches to track that.

105
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,253
You want a picture?

106
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,420
Go ahead, go ahead.

107
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,955
I'll wait for you Jared,
I'll wait for you.

108
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,891
(audience laughs)

109
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,726
We're good?

110
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,660
All right.

111
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,328
So maybe you enjoy playing golf.

112
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,063
You wanna use a smart watch
to track your round of golf.

113
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,668
Maybe you like running and
you wanna track your run.

114
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,437
Kinda helps to have a
little motivation behind you

115
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,973
with a big, giant
dinosaur, but hey,

116
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,242
some people enjoy running.

117
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,411
Maybe you love
listening to sweet,

118
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,813
sweet music by Rick Astley,

119
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,416
but you decide that you
actually want to change

120
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,852
from Rick Astley to the
newest pop sensation

121
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,320
that is hitting
the DFIR community,

122
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,356
Heathers and the
Forensic Femmes.

123
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,959
Maybe you wanna listen
to the sweet tunes

124
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,161
that they have presented for us.

125
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,267
Maybe you're like me, this
was pretty much me last night.

126
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,469
Pretty much me throughout the
whole course of this summit.

127
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,972
You are just exhausted and
you wanna track your sleep,

128
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,707
so however you end
up after your night

129
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,177
of various unicorn shenanigans,

130
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,912
hopefully nobody
got digital herpes

131
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,580
through the course of
any of this presentation.

132
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,685
But, maybe you end up and
wanna track your sleep.

133
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,421
So there's a wide
variety of reasons

134
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,389
to actually use
the smart watches.

135
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,158
Here's some of the specs
for the Pebble Time.

136
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,761
It's a lot of detail, they
actually don't publish

137
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:29,962
a whole lot of it open source,

138
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,631
so it's pretty
difficult to find.

139
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,198
Pretty much the main thing is

140
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,400
they got decent battery lives

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,501
and there's a little
bit of storage

142
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,303
on the actual device itself.

143
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,772
However, the one thing
that I will say about it

144
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,508
is that most of the
data's actually stored

145
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,644
on the phone as well
that you sync it with,

146
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,079
because it essentially just acts

147
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,081
as kind of a mirror
from the application

148
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,684
to send these notifications
to your watch.

149
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,686
So on an Android
device, this is the path

150
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,621
where the actual data is stored.

151
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,325
Here's just it in the file
explorer view so you can see,

152
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,361
once again, pretty
straightforward name,

153
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,363
that's it, subfolders
and all that.

154
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,833
Within that is a whole
lot of SQLite databases

155
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,802
because that's what pretty much
all mobile devices have now,

156
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,338
is they store their data
in SQLite databases.

157
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,240
So essentially you just
pop open the database

158
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,174
and you can parse through it

159
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,241
and pull out whatever you want

160
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,077
from these SQLite databases.

161
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,779
In this particular case
this is pretty much

162
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,281
our main database of
interest on an Android phone.

163
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,616
You can see there's 25 tables

164
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,051
and all of these
different tables have

165
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,318
all kinds of different
data in there

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,653
that you can build parses for

167
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,889
and go through and pull
the data off of them.

168
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,626
The Android apps table's a
listing of every application

169
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,128
and version of the application

170
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,695
that was installed on the phone.

171
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,766
This is incredibly useful if
for whatever reason your tool,

172
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,534
you need to show the
applications that were installed

173
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,170
on the phone, you don't have
to do X, Y, and Z anymore,

174
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,671
you can just go to
Pebble and pull this out

175
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,206
because it pulls
all of that for you.

176
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,176
It stores it all in one
very nice, simple spot.

177
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,545
Here it is just in the
SQLite database again.

178
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,614
The application, the
date it was installed

179
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,048
and the version number.

180
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,683
It's fantastic for getting
a real quick rundown

181
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,319
of the applications that
were installed on the device.

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,655
The notifications is the listing

183
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,825
of every notification that
happened on your phone.

184
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,627
So regardless if it
was actually sent

185
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,963
to your Pebble or not,
Pebble records it all.

186
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,832
So in reality, Pebble is like

187
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,835
a giant DVR for
your Android phone.

188
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,637
Everything that
happens on your phone,

189
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,539
weather updates, plugging it in

190
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,509
and getting battery
charge notifications,

191
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,011
getting emails, getting texts,

192
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,446
getting Facebook notifications,

193
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,347
getting Twitter notifications.

194
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,015
Anything at all that
happens on your phone,

195
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,884
Pebble records it,
and stores it all

196
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,520
in their own database, for you
to go back and pull it out.

197
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,888
So obviously it
contains a lot of

198
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,090
really, really
useful information.

199
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,959
So the one caveat with this

200
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,161
that I found out through
additional research

201
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,697
is even if the user chooses
to clear the notifications,

202
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,899
it doesn't actually wipe
it out from the database.

203
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,770
It records the fact that the
notification was removed,

204
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,171
but it doesn't actually wipe
it out from their own database.

205
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,408
So this is incredibly
useful, obviously,

206
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,343
if you have a bunch
of like text messages

207
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,045
that were deleted
from the phone,

208
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,413
and you can't
recover them anymore,

209
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,215
Pebble has them
all for you still.

210
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,448
Like you can go to Pebble,

211
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,818
it really is a DVR
for your phone.

212
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,120
It's scary the amount of
data that Pebble collects

213
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,656
and obviously I'm not
wearing a Pebble anymore

214
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,658
because this freaked
me out so bad,

215
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,228
I was like, "I'm
not wearing it again

216
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,463
"until you guys fix this."

217
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,832
The timeline items
is the notifications

218
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,300
that are actually
sent to the device.

219
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,869
So we have a whole listing of

220
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,571
a whole bunch of various
notifications that happen.

221
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,273
In our timeline items,
there were very few

222
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,275
that were actually
sent to the device.

223
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,544
It's actually JSON format
within the SQLite database

224
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,079
so we can actually use this

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,715
and see what actual
notifications

226
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,717
were sent to the device itself.

227
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,285
The weather locations is
useful, if the user travels,

228
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,454
you can potentially find
out what cities they went to

229
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,124
just based off of
the weather updates

230
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,226
within the database itself.

231
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,061
Here it is once again,
just date timestamp

232
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,898
and the rough location
of where it actually was.

233
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,667
The SMS messages
is the listing of

234
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,338
the SMS messages that were
sent, recorded by the device.

235
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,706
Once again, just like I said,

236
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,342
it actually can record
deleted SMS messages

237
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,478
that were on the device,
but are no longer there,

238
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,948
but Pebble went ahead and
recorded it all for us.

239
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,050
Just an example, once again,

240
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,752
of the messages in
the SQLite database.

241
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,856
So a little bit
about Pebble on iOS.

242
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,593
This is the primary
Pebble database on iOS.

243
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,661
It has a very, very
different name.

244
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,097
It's one thing like the
Hello Barbie talk yesterday

245
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,033
is they noticed that
the Android application

246
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,569
seemed like it was written
like a five-year-old,

247
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,270
and the iOS was actually
done pretty well.

248
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,072
The same thing here,

249
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,541
the Android application
is ridiculously bad

250
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,610
because it just stores
everything like crazy,

251
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,879
the iOS one was actually
done pretty well.

252
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,347
So there's a lot more
steps to actually

253
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,550
parse useful data out
of the iOS application

254
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,252
from the Pebble, than
compared to the Android

255
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,819
which is completely
straightforward.

256
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,189
And here's just an
example of, once again,

257
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,694
the iOS database
from the Pebble.

258
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,695
So onto the Microsoft Band 2.

259
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,397
The main takeaways
from this once again,

260
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,167
is there is very, very
little onboard storage

261
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,536
and additionally, unlike
the Pebble there's actually

262
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,137
an embedded GPS, so
the device can actually

263
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,208
pinpoint where you are based
off of the device itself.

264
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,443
It doesn't actually need a phone

265
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,944
to determine your
exact location.

266
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,582
Once again, the storage path
is pretty straightforward,

267
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,317
just make sure
it's not emulated.

268
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,821
Here's the folder within
the file browser again,

269
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,123
of our particular
folder of interest.

270
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,093
With this one our primary
folder of interest

271
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,795
is actually called
Response Cache,

272
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,231
which is found in
the subfolder Files.

273
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,635
This contains JSON-formatted
data with GUID names.

274
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,971
And essentially, you have
to go through and correlate

275
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,575
to figure out what the
GUID name is actually used

276
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,910
within the file type itself.

277
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,478
It's also very important to note

278
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,681
that just because there is
actually a response cache,

279
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,449
it may not actually
have an entry

280
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,284
in the SQLite database
to correlate it back to,

281
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,620
depending on how you
actually use your Band.

282
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,590
So in this particular instance,
the very, very simple thing

283
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,926
of Golf is stored with
this very, very long GUID,

284
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,563
which maybe, it fits
the 32 characters

285
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,098
so it's probably a
hash of some sort-ish,

286
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,300
of whatever Golf is.

287
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,801
But I don't know
exactly what method

288
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,772
that Microsoft is using to
determine what that GUID is.

289
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,507
So here it is in
the SQLite database,

290
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,611
and you can see that we have
our little HTTP queries,

291
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,280
and then we have
our type as Golf

292
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,116
and you can see that that
correlates with the GUID.

293
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,985
So we open up just the raw file,

294
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,387
it's obviously JSON-formatted.

295
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,421
There's a whole lot
of data in there,

296
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,690
there's a whole lot of things

297
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,825
that you can take a lot
of time to parse through

298
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,593
and pull out various things.

299
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,663
But really the main takeaways
from this in particular

300
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:40,332
is the distance is
stored in centimeters,

301
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,168
which makes no sense at all,

302
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,170
but that's how they
decided to do it,

303
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,438
so that's what they did.

304
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,006
On this particular
case I actually

305
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,241
shot a round of golf
at a golf course.

306
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,510
I shot an 85.

307
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,312
I did all right until
my hip started to hurt

308
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,047
because it exploded,
which is why

309
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,982
I had to have surgery
on it a month ago.

310
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,785
But I did all right until it
really started to get bad.

311
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,355
Now all of that data that
is stored rawly on a phone,

312
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,691
Microsoft has already built
essentially a parser for.

313
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,859
It's called Microsoft Health

314
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,527
and this is essentially
the web front end

315
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,796
to all of your
Microsoft Band data.

316
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,099
So you create your Microsoft
account, you log into it,

317
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,367
and you're presented
with a very nice,

318
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,368
easy-to-understand screen
that you can go through

319
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,704
and track all of
your information,

320
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,839
pull all this
information out of there.

321
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,410
So the golf data was just a
big long blob of JSON data

322
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,679
that was all formatted crazy
and everything like that.

323
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,116
You go to the website and it's
so easy, it looks so nice.

324
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,252
Like honestly, my goal is
to eventually write a parser

325
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,121
for this and try to
make it look like that.

326
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,122
But honestly, Microsoft
already did it

327
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,925
so I should probably just
copy all of their code and

328
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,895
use their own data
parsing and just do that,

329
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,363
if Microsoft would
share that with us,

330
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,365
which they probably never will.

331
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,502
So the other thing to notice
is the actual app itself

332
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,371
also has a very
similar format of,

333
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,073
it makes everything
look very nice.

334
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,275
It's not the raw data, it's
the actual interpretation

335
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,177
of that data on the application.

336
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,712
One thing I will
point out with this

337
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,749
is despite what this says,
I did not an 865-yard drive.

338
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,851
Like if I could do that,
I would not be here,

339
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,686
I would be making
ridiculous amounts of money

340
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,356
hitting golf balls a very, very
long way like Happy Gilmore.

341
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,491
That's what I would be doing.

342
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,727
So, once again, just remember

343
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,762
that although the
data's actually stored,

344
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,598
the data itself may not
always actually be accurate.

345
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,567
And you can apply this
methodology for anything

346
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,069
that the Microsoft
Band actually does.

347
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,271
If you wanna track the
runs, if you wanna track

348
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,808
your workouts, sleep,
calories burned, steps taken,

349
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,977
anything like that, you can
track all this information

350
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,814
with the same format of
correlating what the entry is

351
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,081
with the GUID and
then going back

352
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,918
and actually pulling
the data out of there.

353
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,453
So in this particular case,
this is just an example,

354
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,289
so we're looking for
our database file

355
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,990
that's gonna be
associated with sleeping.

356
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,792
And there is our GUID.

357
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,161
So we see that has
sleeping, we have the GUID,

358
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,296
so we actually open, we
browse to the folder,

359
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,766
we go to the response
cache, pull up that file,

360
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,101
and there is our information
with actual sleeping.

361
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,970
Once again, this is
just the raw data

362
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,738
from the actual response cache.

363
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,074
We go to the website and
there is our nice sleep data

364
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,476
all nice and fleshed out for us.

365
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,945
Very interesting to note that,

366
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,981
according to the website,
fell asleep at 12:04.

367
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,516
You go to the actual application

368
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,384
and it prints it out
the nice same way,

369
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,421
except it actually says
that it saved it at 12,

370
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,189
you went to sleep at 12:05.

371
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,824
So the exact same
data's actually being

372
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,026
translated differently
by the application

373
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,429
on the phone and the website.

374
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,131
The reason for that is
honestly I don't know.

375
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,632
I don't know the
answer for that,

376
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,835
but it's something that you
have to take into account

377
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,303
when you're actually
going through this data,

378
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,138
is there might
inadvertent time skew

379
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,908
just because of the
website translating data

380
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,776
or the application
translating data.

381
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,811
So the best thing to
do is take the raw data

382
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,447
and just build your
format off of that

383
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,015
and use what the raw data says

384
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,285
and don't necessarily rely
on the application itself

385
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,756
or the website to actually do
the 100% translation for you.

386
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,824
And one of the
other things to note

387
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,160
is that you can have a whole
bunch of connected applications

388
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,562
and websites that
actually all sync

389
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,796
with your Microsoft Band.

390
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,932
And you can store all
kinds of stuff on there,

391
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,768
which once again, you now
have all kinds of data

392
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,637
that you can pull
information from.

393
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,107
So just like I said, there's
a little bit of time skew

394
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:12,211
with the sleep times,
so be prepared for that.

395
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,713
And unfortunately, the
only thing that I do like

396
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,849
about the Apple Watch is they
actually secure their device.

397
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,519
Nobody else really
does that right now.

398
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,388
Like I wish there was a
way to just lock your Band

399
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,822
so if it goes out of
range of your phone

400
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,190
or something like
that, there's no way

401
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,926
to get information off of it.

402
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,661
I really wish that they
would actually come up with

403
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,695
some sort of way to
actually secure a device

404
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,265
like Apple has done
with their watch.

405
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,702
One of the really important
things about this too

406
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,737
is if you decide to
use your smart watch

407
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,872
and walk around and
wear it and everything,

408
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,675
you probably want to take
it off if you're planning on

409
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,410
doing something bad
like breaking the law.

410
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,045
You probably don't
wanna have it on

411
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,478
because it's another
thing that you can

412
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,781
potentially be tracked on.

413
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,549
And if you're gonna lie about

414
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,084
something bad happening to you,

415
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,619
you probably shouldn't be
wearing your smart watch.

416
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,157
This was a case that I believe
happened in Pennsylvania.

417
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,960
They actually grabbed
the Fitbit of the woman

418
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,797
who said that a large
man wearing boots
broke into her house

419
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,232
in the middle of the
night and raped her.

420
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,702
So she was wearing the Fitbit,
the cops saw that and said,

421
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,470
"Hey, I want the
Fitbit information."

422
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,405
And they went through all
the data from the Fitbit

423
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,274
and showed that she was
actually like up and around,

424
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,809
walking around with
no problem at all.

425
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,278
She was not actually lying in
bed sleeping when it happened.

426
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,914
So she was charged with
making false statements

427
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,148
and a whole bunch of stuff,

428
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,985
and the only evidence
was from the Fitbit.

429
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,787
So, once again, if you're
gonna do something bad,

430
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,956
it's probably best
to not wear it.

431
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,192
So in order to actually
protect your data,

432
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,260
you probably want to turn
off as many notifications

433
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,596
as you can, if you
want to actually

434
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,199
use the smart watch
in any fashion.

435
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,101
iOS will not allow you to change

436
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,870
some of these notifications,
so just be aware of that

437
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,072
if you wanna take
the security measures

438
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,842
and try to change some of
them, on iOS you can't.

439
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,377
So on the Pebble app, you just
navigate to notifications,

440
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,046
view the apps, and
turn off the apps

441
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,148
that you actually
want notifications on.

442
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,117
So by default, they
turn on everything,

443
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,218
and everything stays turned on.

444
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,587
When you actually get an update

445
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,722
of the Pebble Time
application itself,

446
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,456
it turns everything
back on all over again.

447
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,526
So every time you do an
update you have to go back

448
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,762
and turn off all of
the notifications.

449
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,400
You should also clear
the notifications
on a regular basis.

450
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,235
Even though it doesn't
actually purge the database,

451
00:17:16,234 --> 00:17:18,169
it's a still good
idea to clear it

452
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,072
because hopefully,
eventually they will fix that

453
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,572
and if you actually
start to clear them

454
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,975
it will actually
really clear them,

455
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:25,610
instead of making a note
that it was cleared.

456
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,312
And the one thing
to note about this

457
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,947
is you have to have at least
one notification on your watch

458
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,818
in order to actually
clear the notifications.

459
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:36,121
So here for example, I have a
couple of the notifications.

460
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,491
Facebook notifications
and a Gmail message.

461
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,393
I just select Clear All,
and the notifications

462
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,262
will be cleared off the watch.

463
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,797
The other thing is

464
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,066
if you actually choose to
sync your healthcare data,

465
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,134
like your actual medical
records and all that,

466
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:52,504
with Microsoft Health, which
Microsoft wants you to do,

467
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,640
if you lose control of
that, technically you could

468
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,544
be held liable for losing
your own PHI information.

469
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,412
And Sweet Brown says it better

470
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,647
than anybody else in the world,

471
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,682
like there is no
reason to do that.

472
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,618
Because if you do, that's just
a whole other can of worms

473
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,220
and a whole 'nother
hole that is potentially

474
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,389
just terrible for everybody.

475
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,056
You should always
use strong passwords.

476
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,592
Don't reuse them,

477
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,060
especially for the
second-or-third-party
apps as well.

478
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,163
Like everybody knows, use
good strong passwords,

479
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,066
like just basic information,
but use good passwords.

480
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,367
Even though it's just
a Pebble and like,

481
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,168
nobody's gonna hack
into my Pebble,

482
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:26,738
use good passwords for
every account that you have.

483
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,375
So, one of the things that I
did have time to put together

484
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,177
is I actually put together
a small Perl script

485
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,481
that should be actually
going live right now,

486
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,682
that is actually going to

487
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,250
pull the information
automatically.

488
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,519
You point it at the databases,

489
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,089
the iOS or the Android database.

490
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,191
You point it at that and it
will actually parse the data

491
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,460
and print everything
out nicely and neatly.

492
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,996
And I personally chose Perl
because it's easier for me

493
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,499
because that is my
background that I have done

494
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,267
most of my coding in Perl.

495
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,002
And on the other hand,
since we all know

496
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,004
that Cellebrite won so
many awards yesterday,

497
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,139
I wanted to make them
work a little bit

498
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,342
before actually just
taking my raw Python stuff

499
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,610
and shoving it into
the next release

500
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,245
of their Physical Analyzer.

501
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,080
Like, do just the very,
very little bit of work,

502
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,114
that's all I ask.

503
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,384
So essentially you just point
the script at it like I said,

504
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,386
and it will run, it will
generate the folders,

505
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,788
it will generate the nice,
easy-to-read HTML output.

506
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,423
And it will also,
thanks to Heather,

507
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,425
will parse the iOS data out.

508
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,927
So this is just
the example of it,

509
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,462
running from the command
line, it will go through,

510
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,997
try to find the tables.

511
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,632
If it finds the tables it
will print everything out

512
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,234
and parse it in nice,
easy HTML format.

513
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,437
For Android, it goes through
and does the canned responses,

514
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,206
applications, notifications
and phone numbers.

515
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,706
Still working on
adding more to that.

516
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,177
And for iOS, right now it
only does notifications

517
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,977
because there's a lot
more work in actually

518
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,181
getting the data out
of the iOS databases.

519
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,584
And here's just an example
of the nice, easy-to-read,

520
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,519
it just generates a quick HTML,

521
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,755
so you can just print
it out and look at it

522
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,924
and it will sort it
automatically by timestamp

523
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,091
and you can go through
and see the notifications.

524
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,295
Example of it on iOS.

525
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,797
There's actually two
columns for timestamps

526
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,399
and I haven't been able
to do enough testing

527
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,867
to figure out which one actually

528
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,902
gets populated all the time.

529
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,370
Because sometimes
the first one does,

530
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,505
sometimes the second does,
so I just print them both out

531
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,942
and say, you just have to
deal with the possibility

532
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,644
of looking at potentially
one or two timestamps

533
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,881
because they store data
in some weird, funky way.

534
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,184
So I would very,
very much like to try

535
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,286
to do more experimentation.

536
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,255
I really, really
wanna try to grab

537
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,123
some of the Bluetooth data
that goes back and forth

538
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,527
because it syncs to the
phone through Bluetooth,

539
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,661
so I really wanna try to capture

540
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,630
some of the Bluetooth captures.

541
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,232
And I also wanna try to work on

542
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,466
expanding to other
smart watches.

543
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,270
Apple Watch probably will
never happen because I am,

544
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,305
obviously, as you can see
the from the Android fan,

545
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,541
I'm not a huge Apple fan at all.

546
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,275
But I might actually spend
a little bit of money

547
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,245
and build my own iOS
environment so I can

548
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,246
do the testing needed to
actually try to parse data

549
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,348
from the Apple Watches.

550
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,150
There is a jailbreak
for the original version

551
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,386
of the Microsoft Band,
which allowed root access

552
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,855
to the Band itself,
to pull data from it.

553
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,590
Everything that I've
seen so far though

554
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,759
is there's really not a
whole lot of actual data

555
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,730
stored on the Band, because
as soon as it gets in touch

556
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,164
with the phone and
does the syncing,

557
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,200
it pushes all that
data up anyway.

558
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,402
So it essentially only
has enough storage

559
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,870
to store what it needs to have

560
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,537
until it syncs to the
phone and then erases it.

561
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,209
So, while there definitely
is data on these devices

562
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,011
that I would like
to get access to,

563
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,512
I'm not as concerned about it

564
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,414
because all of the actual
behind-the-scenes stuff

565
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:23,581
where the data is stored

566
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,517
is actually on the
applications themselves.

567
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,220
And that's pretty
much all for that,

568
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,821
does anybody have any questions?

569
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,524
- [Audience Member] So in
the case that you mentioned

570
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,793
there where they just
used the Fitbit data,

571
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,995
I know with the Pebble, it
does like sleep tracking.

572
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,531
But like, I'll get
up in the morning,

573
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,700
maybe let the dog out and
I'll come back to bed.

574
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,770
It will say that I got up when
I went to let the dog out,

575
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,639
but I'm still in bed
for like another hour.

576
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,976
So what are your thoughts
on, that seems pretty,

577
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,179
like just to base a
conclusion like that

578
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,015
off of a Fitbit band seems
pretty serious to me.

579
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,283
But I also know that

580
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,752
Pebble also released
their open-source code

581
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,120
on how they actually make
all those determinations.

582
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,325
So in your testing, how
accurate did you find out,

583
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,494
did it seem...

584
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,098
- Yeah, so the step
counters on the Pebble,

585
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,600
not so much.

586
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,202
It's just because it essentially

587
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,770
has the accelerometer based in

588
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,540
and it kind of like
detects your wrist movement

589
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,343
or some kind of
weird math happens

590
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,544
with what they built into it,

591
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,780
and that's how Pebble
detects the steps.

592
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,918
With the Band, because
it has the GPS in there,

593
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,719
and that is accurate
like right off the bat.

594
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,022
Like that's the one thing
that really surprised me

595
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,490
with just how accurate.

596
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,959
In some cases, I actually
did a side-by-side comparison

597
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,928
of the Band and my phone,

598
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:46,064
and it was actually more
accurate than my phone was.

599
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,734
In one case where I
actually purposely got out

600
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:52,737
my Garmin standalone GPS unit
and walked around with that,

601
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,307
there were instances where it
was actually more accurate,

602
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,175
the Band was more accurate
than the Garmin was,

603
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,710
but there was also
plenty where the Garmin

604
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,945
was much more accurate.

605
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,313
So it really depends
on how the data

606
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,582
is actually being stored.

607
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,685
In this particular case,
if I remember correctly,

608
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,489
she said that she was in bed
for like three or four hours,

609
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,324
like sound asleep, and woke up

610
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,127
in the middle of the night
and was being attacked.

611
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,095
She woke up when she
was being attacked.

612
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:18,463
And they were able to show like,

613
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,600
you were not asleep,
you were walking around,

614
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,168
and I believe they
actually were able to show

615
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,004
like she was walking to
different rooms of the house.

616
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,606
Like she walked to the
fridge and like stood

617
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,107
in front of the
fridge for a while,

618
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,877
and like went and like went
to the cupboard or something,

619
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,145
came back to the fridge,

620
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,780
and then was just up
and walking around.

621
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,683
So it wasn't the fact
that she was actually,

622
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,720
they made that
conclusion just off that.

623
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,256
It was the aggregate
of, you were obviously

624
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,857
not just asleep like you said,

625
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,527
you were obviously up
and around doing things.

626
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,262
Is that answer?

627
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,096
Okay.

628
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,365
Heather.
- Other questions?

629
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,333
- Heather, Heather.

630
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:00,906
Thank you.

631
