1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,936
(epic music)

2
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,517
- [Robert] I also want to
give Erick a quick chance

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,752
to introduce himself.

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:21,054
I met Erick actually
at Utica College,

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,891
so I teach at a Masters program
in my spare time as well,

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,892
and Erick was one of the
folks that came through there.

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,429
He was incredible
and so I asked him,

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,865
said "hey man, you're really
sharp with this stuff,

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,933
"if you ever wanna
collaborate, let me know."

10
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,536
As an instructor, both
at Sans and elsewhere,

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,138
you say that to people,

12
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,739
you would be surprised
at how many people don't

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,407
ever wanna do some
just something extra.

14
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,343
I imagine most people
in this audience do,

15
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,878
you're here, which is great.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,246
But there's so many people
who don't just wanna go

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,781
that little extra distance.

18
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,083
He took me up on it, he did
most of the work for this,

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,352
so I'll give you a second
just to introduce yourself.

20
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,520
- Cool, thank you,
good afternoon.

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,790
When I first saw that we
were gonna be presenting

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,591
on the second day, the
last day of the summit,

23
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,628
and the last presentation of
the last day of the summit,

24
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,296
I was a little worried
about the turnout,

25
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:05,298
but I'm glad to see you're here

26
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,567
and I want to
thank you for that.

27
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,803
My name is Erick
Mandt. I currently work

28
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,804
for the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations

29
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,040
as an open source
intelligence analyst.

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,843
Worked with them
since October 2009.

31
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:21,681
Prior to that, I spent
roughly 20 years, one month,

32
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,750
and eight days in the
United States Navy

33
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,018
as a cryptologic linguist,

34
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,120
kind of like Rebecca
Brown earlier.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,423
Just a different service,
kinda the parent service,

36
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,726
I will point out to her.
(laughter)

37
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,029
and I did Russian
instead of Chinese,

38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,797
so with that back
over to you, Rob.

39
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,298
- Alright, perfect.

40
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,867
So I really like his
background on intel intel

41
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,969
because that's what we want
to talk about today as well,

42
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,672
is not just the let's
throw the word cyber in it.

43
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,707
The beautiful thing about
intelligence analysis

44
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,643
is it's been around a lot
longer than the word cyber.

45
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,581
So it's interesting to see
the over focus of indicators

46
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,350
try to sort of skew
what we see with intel.

47
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,152
So I wanna talk a little
bit about it today.

48
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,854
We're really gonna
cover three points.

49
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,690
We're gonna cover the
just quick lexicon

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,358
of what cyber threat
intelligence is,

51
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,694
but we'll jump right into
the Platinum Intrusion,

52
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,162
which I think that campaign is

53
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,697
actually really
really interesting,

54
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,366
Microsoft having done some
really good work on that.

55
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,567
We'll go through
threat intelligence

56
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,603
specifically in an
act of cyber defense.

57
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,304
And then Richard
Heuer and Sherman Kent

58
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,672
because it's hard
to do a presentation

59
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,175
without doing a hat tip
to those two fellas.

60
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,010
And we'll go forward with that.

61
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,578
So, I also couldn't
get through this

62
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,647
without putting up a
Little Bobby comic strip.

63
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,682
So threat intelligence,

64
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,385
when I see threat intelligence
in the community today,

65
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,922
there is an over
focus on two points.

66
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,757
You either see a lot
of organizations trying

67
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,593
to get better indicators faster,

68
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:44,664
or you see a large
push to share more.

69
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,933
And the problem
around sharing more is

70
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,368
most of you have
probably experienced

71
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,370
at one point in your
day to day lives,

72
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,506
is if it's just filth,
you don't want more of it.

73
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,143
I rather not rate things on
we have a million indicators,

74
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:00,180
I would love to validate and
rate things on we have 10

75
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,650
really good ones with context
and reports to go with it,

76
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,118
that you can actually
know what's going on

77
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,753
in your network if you see it.

78
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:09,755
So more is not necessarily
better when we talk indicators,

79
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,991
but also threat
intelligence itself

80
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,660
is actually that
intelligence focus, right,

81
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,995
so it's actually the
analysis of information.

82
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,965
IOC's can just be the
byproduct of that.

83
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,301
And most importantly, and this
is where I think most people

84
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,036
trip up, you have to
know what a threat is.

85
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,306
And threat has three
key components;

86
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,775
intent, opportunity,
and capability.

87
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,009
You don't have one of
those three things,

88
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,244
you're not a threat to
any given organization.

89
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,447
That still requires
organizations to understand

90
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,316
what their opportunities are.

91
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,518
So just to phrase
this going forward,

92
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,055
I want to tell you as the author
of the class here at Sans,

93
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,024
that most people shouldn't
be doing threat intel.

94
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,026
Oh man, that's probably
a horrible thing to say

95
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,029
trying to sell a class, no,
most people shouldn't actually

96
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,433
be doing large scale threat
intelligence generation.

97
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,602
We'll talk today about how
everybody can do consumption,

98
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,871
but really there's a
"you must be this high

99
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,075
to ride the ride" kinda
discussion when looking a intel.

100
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,976
It's that five percent
secret sauce you put

101
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,945
on top of a good organization,

102
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,614
not just something you
jump to immediately

103
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,250
expecting to satisfy all
of your requirements.

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,318
Also, when we talk
about Active Defense,

105
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,887
this is the one that
gets sort of mixed up

106
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,656
in the community a lot,

107
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,492
Active Defense was a
strategy for militaries

108
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,027
long before the
word cyber as well,

109
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,930
and it was always about
monitoring your environment,

110
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,566
being able to take action
based off the adversary,

111
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,368
and being able to
adapt over time.

112
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,936
It never has anything
to do with going

113
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,270
into somebody else's territory,

114
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,773
not hack-back, not
geolocation, not honey tokens,

115
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,974
none of that stuff.

116
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,909
The whole process of
Active Defense is a lot

117
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,344
of what you guys do
on a day to day basis,

118
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,582
responding to adversaries and
securing your environments.

119
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,517
So, with that, we'll jump right

120
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,919
into the cyber threat
intelligence portion with

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,822
the Platinum case, which I'll
turn it over to Erick for.

122
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,626
- So, a month, two months
ago, somewhere around that

123
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,229
Microsoft released a report
where they characterize

124
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,134
an intrusion campaign they
identified as Platinum.

125
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,637
You can read on the slide
several details of that.

126
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,140
It's really the work, you
think about Microsoft,

127
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,276
large company, they've got a
lot of collection capability,

128
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,978
they bring in a
lot of information,

129
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,413
so they're able to accurately

130
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,451
correlate a lot of information
and give meaning to that,

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,690
accurately describe TTP's,

132
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,758
and put out a pretty
decent product.

133
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,592
So you can see some of
the characteristics,

134
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:30,229
this really is an effort
against Southeast,

135
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,700
South or Southeast
Asian governments
and telecommunication

136
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,769
providers that might
give you an indication

137
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,138
of the type of actor
that's behind it.

138
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:44,010
You can see some of the
TTP's, the tactics, techniques

139
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,510
and procedures that they use

140
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:49,148
and the interesting point is
it has been active since 2009.

141
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,784
So we're gonna look at this
information that Microsoft

142
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,253
put out in this report
through the lens

143
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,055
of a couple structured
analytic techniques,

144
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,523
the Diamond Model of
intrusion analysis,

145
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,592
which you've heard referenced

146
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,893
and the intrusion kill chain.

147
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,262
In the last couple of days

148
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,764
I've heard it
mentioned a few times,

149
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,699
I've never seen, no one's
really walked through that,

150
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,634
so it's one of the things
we're going to do today.

151
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,871
There we go.
- There we go.

152
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,774
- So this is the Diamond
Model of Intrusion analysis.

153
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,642
It's a pretty basic
looking thing,

154
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,045
it's based on four
core features,

155
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,748
adversary, victim,
infrastructure, and capability.

156
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:26,119
And it's really a
way to characterize

157
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,887
an event with inner intrusion,

158
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,890
it does not focus on the
entirety of an intrusion,

159
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,592
it focuses on an
individual event.

160
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,261
And you see the meta features

161
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:39,966
in the top, I guess,
left, yes left side,

162
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,436
that you can use to
enrich the information

163
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,736
and tell about that.

164
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,472
- I can actually add
onto this as well.

165
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,907
First time saw the Diamond
Model, good ol' Sergio,

166
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,076
for those of you who
haven't met him before,

167
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,544
Sergio's the man.

168
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,344
There's a white paper
that we'll link at the end

169
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,579
that talks about this.

170
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,815
The first time Sergio
talked about this to us

171
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,817
I was working in one of
the intelligence agencies

172
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,386
specifically responsible for
identifying nations-states

173
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,355
breaking into Kirk Lumber
Structures, that was our job,

174
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,724
figuring out attribution
and things around it.

175
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:08,027
And he comes up, Sergio, all
excited as he is off to be,

176
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,329
like I've got this model, it's
going to change everything.

177
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,265
I'm like oh, I'm so
hyped up, what is it.

178
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,532
And I see this wire drawing,

179
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,368
I'm like you gotta
be kidding me man,

180
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,070
like this is it, the big
like model we're gonna use.

181
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,806
But as he walks
you through this,

182
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,073
I want you to keep in context
the amount of information

183
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,510
that should go into this
'cause when we start actually

184
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,546
structuring our
analysis differently
based off of something

185
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,949
as simple as this
little wire drawing,

186
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,584
we actually started
identifying nation-states

187
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,187
we never even thought were
going to be in our data sets,

188
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,622
and we started identifying
threat actors that

189
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,592
we though were three years
off from actually being able

190
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,027
to target the kind of
infrastructure we were guarding.

191
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,064
So, I just wanna give a quick
hat-tip to it in a sense,

192
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,167
that it actually ends up being
a very, very useful model.

193
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,702
- Just to build on that,

194
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,638
it looks very kinda
basic and simple,

195
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,207
but it's actually
a pretty flexible

196
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,810
and a powerful model to use.

197
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,613
Here you can, you've heard
pivoting referenced multiple

198
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,114
times throughout the
last couple of days,

199
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,750
this is what pivoting looks
like in the Diamond Model.

200
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,587
You can start with any
one of the core features,

201
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,156
and pivot and look at one
of the other core features,

202
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,791
and begin asking
yourself questions

203
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,393
and answering those
questions about say

204
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,530
start with a capability,
take a given capability,

205
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,998
it doesn't matter which one,

206
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,000
start asking yourself,
who uses that capability.

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,870
We might not know the
specific person, organization,

208
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,372
or individual, but you can
begin characterizing them.

209
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,307
Look at the infrastructure,

210
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,775
what do we know about
the infrastructure,

211
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:34,746
what IP addresses, do they fully
control the infrastructure,

212
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,650
is it exploited boxes that
they just happen to be using

213
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,718
and they know it might
now be a permanent thing,

214
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,687
and then also, perhaps
most importantly,

215
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,591
looking at the victim, who
is being targeted on that,

216
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,962
because that can feed into a
lot of really important things,

217
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,098
and you can tell a lot
about the adversary.

218
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,035
So let's take a look at
the Platinum Intrusion,

219
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,637
we'll run through
three slides really,

220
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,340
to just walk you through
what it looks like.

221
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,544
Here's the very basic
one, it's weaponization.

222
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,415
In this case the
adversary, unidentified,

223
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,349
embeds an Active X control
in a Word document.

224
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,553
So they've developed
a capability.

225
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,855
This is a way just
to characterize that.

226
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,457
Not a lot of
information in this one.

227
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,994
You see in the next slide
the delivery aspect of it

228
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,664
can feel a little
bit more information.

229
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,432
It's very concise, it's a
good balance between being

230
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,467
concise but also very clear.

231
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,072
The weaponized
document is delivered

232
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,942
through a spear phishing
email to a personal,

233
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,843
a non-official email account.

234
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,013
If you look at step
two, it's accessed

235
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,549
that personal web mail
account is accessed

236
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,016
on a government computer,

237
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,552
obviously there was some
reconnaissance that went in

238
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:49,889
that indicated this is
the likely viable method

239
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,358
for delivering that.

240
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,161
And then, you know obviously
spear phishing works,

241
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,731
they open a document and it
delivers a capability to them.

242
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,201
So to go on to one more,
exploitation phase.

243
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,637
Here, you can see,
again as Rob mentioned,

244
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:08,340
the amount of data that you
can really fit into this

245
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:12,678
Diamond Model in a good
easy to understand way.

246
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,214
Again, just a little
bit of overlap,

247
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,183
the victim opens a
trojanized Word document,

248
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,420
that Active X control then
reaches out and downloads

249
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,488
to and adversary
controlled infrastructure,

250
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,126
downloads a JavaScript,
executes a JavaScript,

251
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,661
it fingerprints the
browser, and the reaches out

252
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:34,400
and grabs a PNG that has
a second zero day in it,

253
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,268
and then that one is executed,

254
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,306
provides a capability
to execute remote code

255
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,743
to a memory corruption
vulnerability.

256
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,178
So, I've walked through these
three slides really quickly,

257
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:51,083
but hopefully you can see
that it's a very flexible tool

258
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,452
where you can get a
lot of information

259
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,889
in about individual events
and that's really the,

260
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,425
with inner intrusion, that's
really one of the strengths

261
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,026
of the Diamond Model.

262
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,895
Now, I'll turn it over to Rob

263
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,563
and he'll talk a little bit
about the intrusion kill chain

264
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,098
which really focuses on the
entirety of the intrusion.

265
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,535
- Perfect, so, this is
actually where I wanna note,

266
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,303
so if we look through any

267
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,538
of these slides as
we flip through,

268
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,074
how much of that looks to you

269
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,309
like almost every campaign ever?

270
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,179
When we say like oh, spear
phishing, zero day, drops,

271
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,481
Active X, congratulations right?

272
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:25,284
So that first view we look
at and go why, who cares,

273
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,718
like what's the point?

274
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,654
The whole point with
Diamond Model, Kill Chain,

275
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,923
all these different models
that you've heard about,

276
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,659
are just to put data
in different buckets.

277
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,462
It's just to structure data
so that when analysts are

278
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,631
actually going through and they
start identifying patterns,

279
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,732
that's everything we wanna do

280
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:41,867
in terms of
intelligence analysis.

281
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,868
So the Kill Chain, I
always love talking

282
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,538
about the Kill Chain
because the first thing

283
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,741
that I can sense is
when I say that word,

284
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,776
there's definitely a side
of the audience before

285
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,945
that's seen the Lockheed
marketing that takes place,

286
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,014
and you just sink in your chair

287
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,916
and go "kill chain oh my gosh,"

288
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,819
but the reason I like
that is 'cause I get a lot

289
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,387
of folks come up to me
and go "kill chain's dead,

290
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,621
"kill chain doesn't work."

291
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,156
I go, "oh, cool, 100%
totally agree with you.

292
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,759
"Why doesn't it work?"

293
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:09,695
"Ah, well, somebody on
Twitter was telling me,"

294
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,896
I go, "okay."

295
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,131
Until you can figure
out why it doesn't work,

296
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:13,665
it's probably a good
model to use anyways,

297
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,301
but all models are broken.

298
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,537
All models break down over time.

299
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,040
The entire purpose
behind them is being able

300
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,709
to structure data and
use it for your purpose.

301
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:26,344
It's not this mythical,
magical cure-all.

302
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,646
So when we look
along the Kill Chain

303
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,281
around reconnaissance,
weaponizations,

304
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,882
all of the things you know.

305
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,852
Think of it not as
from where do I disrupt

306
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,087
the Kill Chain
defender perspective,

307
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,256
but think of it from
the analyst perspective.

308
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,725
Where do I start seeing
indicators that are popping up

309
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,995
in multiple intrusions across
these different data sets

310
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,298
that are matching the same
phase of the Kill Chain.

311
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,701
Why am I starting to see
the same memory corruption

312
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,571
vulnerability being exploited
in different campaigns.

313
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,073
Then you add in the
victim analysis piece

314
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,341
in the Diamond Model, which
I think is probably one

315
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,877
of the strongest
attributes of it.

316
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:01,513
Who even has the motivation
to go after this target?

317
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,983
So the Guccifer
presentation that you had,

318
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,483
you know there's a lot of
different things we can talk

319
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,154
about attribution, but it
probably wasn't somebody

320
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,822
scraping off credit cards.

321
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,191
Probably wasn't a
cyber crime type actor.

322
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,760
We can start ruling out just
based off victim analysis

323
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,129
what we think it
may or may not be.

324
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,898
And as we start
structuring that data along

325
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,866
is when we'll see
those patterns.

326
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,601
So that's what I
wanted to hit on here.

327
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,702
The first thing I'll do is talk

328
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,371
about the Active Defense piece,

329
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,606
is the Active Cyber Defense
Cycle, it's one of my models,

330
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,409
I'll admit to you that I only
threw the word cyber in there

331
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,211
because it makes
the acronym ACDC

332
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,979
and I just thought
that was clever,

333
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,015
but the whole structure of this

334
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,150
and the reason I want to
show this to you here,

335
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,588
is when most organizations
say I want threat intel,

336
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,457
what they really mean
is I want somebody smart

337
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,427
in my organization who
understands my organization

338
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,163
well enough to go out
into the larger field

339
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,631
and collect whatever's available

340
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,632
and apply it to my organization.

341
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,936
That is threat
intelligence consumption.

342
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,573
That's a model like
that, using intelligence

343
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,174
to drive your
processes for hunting

344
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,276
inside the environment,
doing instant response,

345
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,844
doing threat analysis
on the back end,

346
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,646
and competing in that loop.

347
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,584
That's what most organizations
want to be doing.

348
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,920
When we start talking about
threat intelligence generation,

349
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,123
which is analysis of lots
of intrusions over time,

350
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,861
Kill Chain analysis matched
with the Diamond Model,

351
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,230
Diamond Model for each
phase of the Kill Chain,

352
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,731
when I start saying
all these things

353
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,266
there's probably some of you
who are just tuning it out

354
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:30,301
and going that looks like a
lot of work, 'cause it is.

355
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,171
There's a lot of
organizations on this planet

356
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,672
that shouldn't even be thinking

357
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,708
about trying to
generate intelligence

358
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,711
'cause they don't have the
right amount of data for it.

359
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,945
Which I don't want
to put of anybody,

360
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,047
I don't wanna say
like you two can't,

361
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,316
I wanna say that there's
organizations that need

362
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:46,619
to take a look at
their security maturity

363
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,320
and validate the
return on investment

364
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,456
they're getting out
of any given process.

365
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,258
'Cause when you actually
combine the two,

366
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,426
and you start matching
up with organizations

367
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,495
that do generate
intelligence very well,

368
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,998
whether it's in information
sharing at an analysis center,

369
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,799
whether it's Microsoft
getting lots of data,

370
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,535
whether it's the government
as if they're gonna help,

371
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,938
but whether it's anybody
that's actually sharing this

372
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,206
side of intelligence with you,

373
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,307
you've gotta know how to use it

374
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,475
and how it winds up with you,

375
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,477
or it's ultimately
going to be meaningless.

376
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,047
How many of you have heard
actionable intelligence?

377
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,950
Oh my gosh, yes, I heard
the grunts and groans.

378
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,653
I hate that term, probably
for different reasons

379
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,555
than most of you,
but I hate that term

380
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,492
because if you look at what
intelligence really is,

381
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,961
it must satisfy a requirement

382
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,829
or you're not
doing intelligence.

383
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,265
So by the very definition
of what intelligence is,

384
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,035
there's no such thing as
un-actionable or in-actionable

385
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,938
intelligence so there's not
actionable intelligence.

386
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,307
You are creating requirements
that you are mapping

387
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,410
and actually doing the
process or you're not.

388
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,512
Just an AV feed with
a bunch of indicators

389
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,315
is not intelligence, its
actual information analysis.

390
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,850
So when you see
this process here

391
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,652
going back and forth between
that generation consumption,

392
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,021
this is what we wanna
get the community to.

393
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,623
I like when folks
come into my class

394
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,059
on the threat intelligence
side and go wow,

395
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,194
I realize that we're
not the group that wants

396
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,264
to create intelligence,
we wanna use it.

397
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,932
Wow, we just saved
20 million dollars

398
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,701
in threat intelligence to
make sure we didn't split

399
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,069
up a team for nothing, I'm like,

400
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,972
great job guys, that's
a good ROI to take.

401
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,540
But it's try to be defeatists,

402
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,275
it's trying not to
push people down,

403
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,843
the whole point is saying
what do you actually wanna do,

404
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,479
what's your big requirement?

405
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,648
So we look at it from
this perspective,

406
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,049
which is, I'll let
Erick cover it a lot,

407
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,918
but what I wanna say
about this perspective,

408
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,087
is you need to know, looking
at the Diamond Model,

409
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,889
looking at any given
structure analysis set,

410
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,793
what side you fall on,
and the big pitch here

411
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,629
is your organization with all
the things you have to do,

412
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,864
whether you're in the military

413
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,432
and you've got all
the CBT's to do,

414
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,135
whether you're on a regulation
and compliance side,

415
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,436
maybe you're with the
electric sector and you've got

416
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,505
nerc cip regulations
you've got to acquire,

417
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,241
you've got stuff
to do all day long.

418
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,411
You will probably only get to
focus on one of these sides

419
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,945
of the ply, right,
you will either say

420
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm gonna be
operational using it,

421
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,717
or I'm going to be generating
it and be an analyst.

422
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,786
The problem I see is when
most folks try to do both,

423
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,021
they fail at both.

424
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,488
You've got to figure
out where you are

425
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,024
and try to take advantage
of those models.

426
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,558
Why don't I let you
walk this through it.

427
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,060
- So jumping onto that,
whichever side that you're on,

428
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,063
whether you're on the consumer
or the generation side,

429
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,034
it's good to understand the
relationship between the two

430
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,303
so that you can effectively
manage that relationship.

431
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,105
Going back to the Diamond Model,

432
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,442
one of the things I really
like about it is it really

433
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,545
provides a natural divide in
how you can understand that.

434
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,847
The top model is really
an intelligence of you

435
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,750
where you're externally focused,

436
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,052
you're looking at the adversary.

437
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,253
What is the adversary doing?

438
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,221
What infrastructure
does the adversary have?

439
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,223
What type is it, you can see
the different ways you can

440
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,761
characterize it on right
above infrastructure.

441
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,766
You also look at what type of
adversary you're encountering

442
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,269
and the tactics,
techniques, and procedures.

443
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,072
So it gives the focuses
on the external actor.

444
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,375
The bottom part to me is that's
where we have the control,

445
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,477
that's our network, where
the network defenders--

446
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,346
I kinda wish I'd changed the
word victim to network defender

447
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,516
because the victim is kind of
a defeatist approach there,

448
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,685
but the network defender,

449
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,655
that's where you have
your action on this.

450
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,490
What network security monitoring

451
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,493
and asset identification
processes do you have?

452
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,761
What ability do you have

453
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,629
to manipulate threat
and the environment?

454
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,435
On the capabilities side, do
you have instant response plans

455
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,870
fully developed and practiced?

456
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,473
Again the threat
environment manipulation,

457
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,609
and then getting down to,
as Robert's talked about,

458
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,843
the victim side of this.

459
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,913
You know, looking at
who is being attacked,

460
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,416
that tells a lot
about the adversary.

461
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,685
Are you dealing with
critical infrastructure

462
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,019
that you're trying to protect?

463
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,721
Are you protecting
financial data,

464
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,390
customer data,
proprietary information?

465
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,527
Understanding both
sides of the diamond,

466
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,296
both the external and the
internal of what you're doing.

467
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,397
- [Robert] Wait, if you
could go back one real quick.

468
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,866
- Sure.

469
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,334
- So here's one thing I
also want to leave you with

470
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,603
on this discussion of
which side you're on,

471
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,705
how many defenders
on a regular basis,

472
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,508
want to know if it's
China, Russia, whatever,

473
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,810
watch, right, that's the
topic, we always see it.

474
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,544
Well was it China,
was it Russia?

475
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,080
If you're doing the
operational side

476
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,716
of consuming intelligence,
if you're on the side

477
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,885
that's actually doing
network security,

478
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,821
I actually think that it hurts
you to even think about that.

479
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,789
So lets run through
a little quick drill.

480
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,292
China's on you network,
what are they looking for?

481
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,795
- IP.
- IP, intellectual property.

482
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,465
Russia's on you network,
and other than the DNC,

483
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,199
what are they looking for?

484
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,269
(audience members speaking)
They could be doing that,

485
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,770
but are they doing any sort
of military preparations,

486
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,138
maybe a little bit
of reconnaissance

487
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,973
for a larger
intelligence apparatus.

488
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,408
Iran is on your network,
what might they be doing?

489
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,547
- [Audience Member] Nuclear.

490
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,814
- Nuclear environment,
that's always a good one.

491
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,183
I always hear things
like data deletion.

492
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,384
Same thing with North Korea.

493
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,852
If North Korea's on
your network and you're,

494
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,754
unfortunately, you're
Sony, anybody else though,

495
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,188
same thing, data deletion right.

496
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,491
This is where
defenders mindsets go,

497
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,760
all of that is bias.

498
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,696
All of that is you have seen
one or two campaigns before

499
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,600
about adversary X and it
focuses how you look at it.

500
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,901
Every single team out
there across the world

501
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,671
has every one of those teams.

502
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,407
And when I go in
places across the world

503
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,775
I still have to include US
and their threat landscapes.

504
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,011
I'm like, yeah the US has
IP teams and military teams

505
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,947
and intelligence teams,
same thing with Russia,

506
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,416
China, and Iran,
everybody has them.

507
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,618
So if you're only starting
to think about attribution

508
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,587
at that tactical level,
you're going to bias the way

509
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,589
that you look at the data
and you're gonna miss things.

510
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,357
That's one of the key
points I wanna draw out

511
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,591
of this model here.

512
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,859
Is if you're on the
operational side,

513
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,062
it's not about who
the adversary is,

514
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,330
it's about threat groups.

515
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,864
Can we call it sparkling pander,

516
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,801
or whatever else you wanna
call it to group them together,

517
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,770
great, can we call it
some level of actor

518
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,139
that we can view all the
intrusions to see patterns

519
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,640
across them, good job.

520
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,776
But until you start talking
at the strategic level,

521
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,944
you may not care.

522
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,779
Your board of
directors might care.

523
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,681
If you dealing in
the government,

524
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,483
the policy makers might care.

525
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,485
But you're not gonna patch
the network differently,

526
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,455
respond differently, look for
sim cash or PSX differently,

527
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,157
you're not gonna do different
instant response tactics

528
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,026
if you think it's China
versus Russia, and if you are,

529
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,229
I'm gonna tell you that
you're doing it based of bias,

530
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,532
and you will get caught with
your proverbial pants down

531
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,768
and it will not be
a fun time, alright.

532
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,303
So we've got to figure
out how to look at this

533
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,871
from either side of the angle.

534
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:13,705
Continue on.

535
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,275
- So, just one more slide,

536
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,909
kind of putting the
two sides together.

537
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,078
If you use this view to
understand relationship,

538
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,814
kinda gives us a red
force, blue force approach.

539
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,884
And it's a good way, a
mental way, at least for me,

540
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,620
hopefully it is for you, to
understand the relationship

541
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,122
between the
intelligence production

542
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,758
and the intelligence
consumption.

543
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,063
Now we've gone through a
lot of semi pretty pictures

544
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,831
up here, little diagrams,

545
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,033
- [Robert] This one's
for you Rebecca.

546
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,199
You're not even
looking, you're texting.

547
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,769
- I'm eating!
- Okay.

548
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,238
- All lot of this is just
not us coming up with,

549
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,240
or the people who came up
with these models just kind of

550
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,775
come up with something
on their own,

551
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,844
it's really built on the
work of some other people.

552
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,913
Richard Heuer, very well-known

553
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,615
with the intelligence community,

554
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,784
career CIN employee,

555
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,987
started out on the
case officer side

556
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,588
and switched over to
intelligence analysis,

557
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,658
and as he was developing
his careers as an analyst,

558
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,528
he started thinking
about how he did it.

559
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,797
He started thinking
about how he thinks.

560
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,299
And that led him
to kinda going off

561
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,235
into a little bit
of esoteric stuff.

562
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:20,639
He started talking about looking
into cognitive psychology,

563
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,139
how does the brain work?

564
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,277
And he identified a
couple key issues,

565
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,946
one is he was convinced
that good intelligence is

566
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,380
in the head, it's
not in the numbers,

567
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,484
it's not an automated
process, it's not in tools,

568
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,387
it's in the head, it's the
application of human intellect.

569
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:37,989
A couple of areas
that he focused on

570
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:40,025
were perception and memory.

571
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,427
As all of you guys are
out there listening to me,

572
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,895
you're all perceiving
me different.

573
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,231
You're going to take different
things away from this talk

574
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,133
as you listen to Rob and myself,

575
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,701
because you come from
different places,

576
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,970
you have different experiences,
you might have different

577
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,638
levels of interest in
what you're hearing,

578
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,308
you might have differing
levels of understanding of it.

579
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,778
That will frame what
you take away from this.

580
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,980
Memory is not like the camera
in the back of the room

581
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,116
where it just
records everything,

582
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,651
your brain kinda
creates a story,

583
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,154
and that's how it
stores the information.

584
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,858
On the memory side, there's
some limitations there as well.

585
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,393
There's this kinda
magic rule of seven,

586
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,863
that your brain can really
handle in active memory,

587
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:19,798
about seven pieces
of information.

588
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,134
Some people a little bit
less, some a little more.

589
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,468
But if you start
getting above that,

590
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,003
you're gonna start
forgetting things,

591
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,240
you're gonna undervalue
different things,

592
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,610
so these were weaknesses,
you know our brain is a tool.

593
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,344
So we've heard talked about
all the different tools

594
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,315
for forensics, some of
them are good in one thing

595
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,419
and not good in the other,
same thing for our brain.

596
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,454
So Mr. Heuer came up
with a couple things

597
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:44,456
that you can do to address that.

598
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,125
One is decomposition,
one's externalization.

599
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,660
Decomposition's just
really breaking things

600
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,795
down into the basics.

601
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,230
If you think about
the Diamond Model,

602
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,566
that's broken down into
four basic components,

603
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:58,270
that's really, it's
Richard Heuer's thought

604
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,873
put out in application
and it's externalized,

605
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:04,576
that means it's documented,
put together down on paper,

606
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,412
so that you're able to
recall these information

607
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,148
or have some reference
material to go back to.

608
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,984
He also in his book
the Psychology of
Intelligence Analysis,

609
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,553
which I really
encourage you to read,

610
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,423
he's come up with an analysis
of competing hypothesis,

611
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:22,961
I heard it talked about
briefly in the previous talk.

612
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,531
Again, it flows very well from
the victim's side of things

613
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,834
because if you know something
about who's being target,

614
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,969
that tells you a bit
about who the actor is

615
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,806
and what the capabilities are
that they might be employing.

616
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,408
One of the very interesting
things about analysis

617
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,477
of competing hypothesis that
I found it's a very good

618
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,581
kinda control on bias that
Rob was talking about,

619
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,149
is it requires you to
generate multiple biases,

620
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,521
or multiple hypothesis, and
then you're not seeking to prove

621
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,124
one of the hypothesis, you're
seeking to identify the one

622
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,460
that has the least chance
of being incorrect.

623
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,996
So it's a little bit different
turning things on the head,

624
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,931
from my perspective.

625
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,734
And he also recognized that
intelligence, like Robert said,

626
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,736
it's only intelligence
if someone wants it.

627
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:06,938
Intelligence for
intelligence sake

628
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,607
is really kinda worthless.

629
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,541
Anything you'd like
to add on that?

630
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,076
- [Robert] Nope, go ahead.

631
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,044
- So one other
individual, Sherman Kent,

632
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,246
he's really kinda the godfather

633
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,048
of American
intelligence analysis,

634
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,684
although he started
out in the 30's

635
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,653
as a history professor at Yale,

636
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,255
and then moved into the
intelligence community

637
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,657
in the Central
Intelligence Agency.

638
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:28,493
He still kinda anticipated
the advent of the computers

639
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,897
and he understood that
automated processes are aids

640
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,633
to human thinking but that
didn't change the fact

641
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,903
that the human, well-trained
analyst is really

642
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,005
remains the intelligence
device supreme.

643
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,608
That's really, the human
element comes in on that.

644
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,044
His work has resulted
in analytic doctrine.

645
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,349
It's really, well you can
see all nine points there,

646
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,184
the one that's most
applicable here,

647
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,086
and hopefully you've
seen this come through,

648
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,722
is the relationship that focuses
on policy-maker concerns,

649
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,391
what's that really talking
about is the relationship

650
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,928
between intelligence producers
and intelligence consumers.

651
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,262
They both have to be there.

652
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,098
I think in the
Intrusion Kill Chain,

653
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:11,903
the title of the paper is
Intelligence Driven Defense,

654
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,004
so that's all fine and good,

655
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,940
but I would argue
that you need to

656
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,175
take it a step farther back,

657
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:20,211
and start with the policy-maker,
the consumer of that,

658
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,047
'cause that's what
really kicks off

659
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,382
and defines what the
intelligence producers

660
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,784
are going to do for you.

661
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,719
So I took a little
bit of liberty

662
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,589
with the statement he made.

663
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,456
Network defense,
it's kinda like love,

664
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:34,659
it really takes two to make it.

665
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,895
You gotta have the intel and
you gotta have the consumers.

666
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,798
And they gotta get along
and be kinda intimate.

667
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,866
- Yeah, I wanna note as we
start rounding this out.

668
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,469
Look at just that
nine list right there.

669
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,271
Just take a quick look at it,

670
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,541
and if you can map this
intelligence framework,

671
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,042
the old-school intelligence,
and just think about

672
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,811
how this applies to
our day to day basis

673
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:55,347
with what we see and
are inundated with now.

674
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,882
Number nine, candid
admission of mistakes.

675
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,818
I really like our vendor
community and all the

676
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:01,953
threat intelligence
analysis stuff that happens,

677
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,555
but when's the last time
you've ever seen anybody

678
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,991
come out and go,
"oh, we got it wrong,

679
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,960
"the attribution was off, we
had some different indicators

680
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,195
"that took us down
the wrong path,

681
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,364
"and here's the
new information."

682
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,632
Anybody's ever seen that?

683
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,266
I know I haven't.

684
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,635
And the problem with
that is attribution,

685
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,269
we have this whole
discussion earlier,

686
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,904
attribution changes over time.

687
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,340
Toolkits, indicators,
things like that,

688
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,109
they fade in and out,
different people use them.

689
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,909
Keys that the Russians
might of used at one point

690
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,613
are now attributable and
relevant to everyone else.

691
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,415
We as a community, if I
look at where we really need

692
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,617
to take a step forward,
as we're going and moving.

693
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,019
Number one, with have to
understand the difference

694
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,121
between intelligence
consumption generation.

695
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,256
Number two, we need to
start getting better

696
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,191
at going back classical
intel and realizing

697
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,193
it's gotta address
concerns upfront,

698
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:45,230
and the very end of it,
we gotta make sure we're

699
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,532
ready to admit our mistakes
or changes over time.

700
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,769
Until we can do that,
policy-makers will
never listen to us.

701
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,971
Unfortunately sometimes
intelligence analysis

702
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,439
gets to that level.

703
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,042
I've seen a lot of reports
go to national policy-makers.

704
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,343
I deal out with a bunch
of congress critters now

705
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,479
out in the think tank
that I work when in DC.

706
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,315
And you'd be surprised at how
much they listen to people

707
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,419
in the community that I would
imagine most of us dislike.

708
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,821
There are certain key figures
that all of us sort of like

709
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,755
rally around and go,
"ah, he's a jerk."

710
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,025
and then yet they get
the ear of congress

711
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,894
because they're a cyber
security whatever expert.

712
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,363
So a lot of this intelligence
stuff that goes on

713
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,099
based off the data that you
collect and produce, right,

714
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,300
so a lot of instant
response data

715
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,135
is really where threat
intel comes from.

716
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,604
That level of data
is what's required.

717
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,540
When it goes up
to national policy

718
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,175
or tactical level defense,

719
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,043
things can change drastically.

720
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,212
And we have to be aware
of how it's gonna be used

721
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,448
or we're going to end up
being the suckers instead

722
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,950
of the people who are actually
contributing to anything.

723
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,553
So we'll go ahead and
go to the next one here,

724
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,021
as we start rounding it out.

725
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,755
I just put some references
and readings for you.

726
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,093
There is no way to do a good
"here's everything about intel"

727
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,161
in like a 30 minute
kinda presentation.

728
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:53,131
You need to do some reading.

729
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,632
I love my class,
don't get me wrong,

730
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,900
that's why I like teaching it,

731
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,036
and we try to give
on the class side

732
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,439
20 years of intelligence
work in five days

733
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,074
and just water hose it.

734
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,810
But the only way you're
really really gonna get good

735
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,178
after that, is you gotta read.

736
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,981
A lot of the intelligence
analysis stuff isn't

737
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,316
"here's how you run this tool,"

738
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,751
it not, "here's the man file,"

739
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,187
it's what were people
thinking about working through

740
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,389
hard challenges in
Operation Bodyguard.

741
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,860
How are they doing
things in Vietnam

742
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,461
compared to Desert Shield.

743
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,997
How are the Chinese in the
second sino Japanese war

744
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,899
dealing with the
Japanese Imperial Army?

745
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,435
Think about the intelligence
analysis of those folks,

746
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,270
and then try to map it
over to what we're doing.

747
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,139
So I put the references up,
some of the ones that I enjoy,

748
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,042
Diamond Model, Sliding
Scale, Phycology Analysis,

749
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,512
the threat intelligence poster
that you've probably gotten

750
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,813
multiple copies of
by now I'm sure.

751
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,115
So those exist as well.

752
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,418
And then the last
slide, of course,

753
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,953
Little Bobby to roll it out.

754
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,687
I write these things so of
course I'll include them.

755
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,457
"We need more
scalable cloud based

756
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,259
"threat intelligence analytics,

757
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,494
"and automated big data end
point security solutions,"

758
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,029
Little Bobby says.

759
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,932
Matt says, "You have no idea
what you just said, do you?"

760
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,434
He says, "Nope, I just read
off a list of words out loud

761
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:04,936
"and got invited to
speak at a conference.

762
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,303
"I figured if I
told two more people

763
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,806
I'd be a security expert."

764
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,607
Matt says, "Yeah,
sounds about right."

765
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,876
So as you go forward,
looking at these things,

766
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,878
as you go forward thinking
about different ways

767
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:17,514
to do analysis, be that voice
of change in the community,

768
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,517
when somebody,
attribution case, says,

769
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,453
"oh well that C2 server
could've been reused."

770
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,122
Be like, "Well, did you
look at the actual data

771
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,024
"that went into
creating that analysis,

772
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,592
"or are you just being that
pain point in the community?"

773
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,596
How many of you have worked an
instant response case before?

774
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,867
Do you feel that I could
come in after reading one

775
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,702
of you reports and tell
you all the same things

776
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,671
about your instant
response case?

777
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,340
Do you feel that if I wasn't
on your instant response team

778
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,608
dealing with that case,

779
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,443
that I would be an
expert on that case?

780
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,445
Probably not, but it's
funny to me that when people

781
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,746
come up with analysis
along intelligence,

782
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,617
everybody's automatically
an expert and can dime out

783
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,918
and tear down every
bit of analysis.

784
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,120
There's a lot of stuff
that goes into it.

785
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,487
Try to be that force of change,

786
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,557
go to figure out where
those references are,

787
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,860
and be mindful of where
your data's gonna go

788
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,428
'cause it makes a
huge difference.

789
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,562
Erick, any last thoughts?

790
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,363
- Nope, I'm good.
- Perfect.

791
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,866
Thank you so much
for your time today.

792
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,167
I guess I'm supposed to ask
questions now, too, right?

793
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,400
I'm supposed to ask
questions of you,

794
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:11,803
we're reversing here at Sans.

795
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,504
- Hold up, it's a--
- Not now?

796
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,805
- [Announcer] Yeah hold up.

797
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:15,974
- Oh, I'm supposed
to wait for those.

798
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,941
- [Announcer]
Audience questions.

799
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,443
- Alright, we'll wait for that,

800
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,411
but you have a question good
sir, up front, go for it.

801
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,080
- [Audience Member] Go ahead?

802
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,548
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

803
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,382
- You got a microphone
coming there.

804
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,218
- Alright, I'll
just yell at him.

805
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,255
- [Audience Member] So you
showed the Diamond Model,

806
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,789
which is very valuable
and have been able

807
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,291
to use it a few times,

808
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:37,629
question I have is if you've
seen it used more successfully

809
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,563
at the beginning as
you're doing the analysis,

810
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,634
or most often at
the final analysis,

811
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,369
post mortem phase of things,

812
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:46,838
and then anything automated
that you've seen to actually

813
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,973
take your IOC's and
populate them out

814
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,408
based upon what you know.

815
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,043
- Oh yeah, good question,
so I'll speak up,

816
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,212
I'll repeat him because I think
it was a little bit quiet.

817
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,914
Really good
questions, number one,

818
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,581
where have I seen it
most successfully used,

819
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,385
the back end or the front end
of the analysis being done,

820
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,753
and number two, is
there any sort of tools

821
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,354
that can help us out here.

822
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,524
So it completely depends
on your vantage point,

823
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,659
and I'm not gonna give you
a it depends answer alone,

824
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,928
I'll answer the question,

825
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,195
but it depends on
your vantage point

826
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,264
and what you're trying to do.

827
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,698
When I was on a team that,

828
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:15,900
and nowadays it's
called threat hunting,

829
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,136
when I was on a team
doing the kind of stuff

830
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,537
that we call threat hunting now,

831
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,905
we used it on the front end.

832
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,307
We used it on, you know what,

833
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,276
I've got some data from
our different data sets,

834
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,111
I've got a bunch
of data related to,

835
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,280
we'll call them honey pots,

836
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,182
hydroelectric
facilities in Africa

837
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,151
and people targeting them.

838
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:36,821
Hmm, who would even be
interested in going after

839
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,692
hydroelectric facilities in
Africa and sub setting contracts

840
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,161
for big construction projects
in Sub-Saharan Africa?

841
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,763
I wonder if any of this data
relates to the indicators

842
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,433
that I've had before based
on Chinese intrusion groups.

843
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,602
Oh look, we found new teams
that we didn't even realize

844
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,204
because we see the
real world events,

845
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:55,940
not just the cyber ones where
certain Chinese companies

846
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,009
are starting to win
all the contracts

847
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,211
in all the areas that
we saw getting targeted.

848
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,713
And that's where you
would use the diamond

849
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,315
on the front model more
victim analysis focused.

850
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,217
On the back end, when you're
actually creating intelligence

851
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,988
products and actual reference
guides or big analysis sets,

852
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,990
you'll still use it, and you'll
structure that data along,

853
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,692
and you'll go okay,
did I do it correctly?

854
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,527
But on that Diamond
Model on the back end,

855
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,663
that's really where
you gotta bring in ACH.

856
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,665
'Cause we all have biases.

857
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,069
I'm a Sans instructor, I'm
from Alabama, I'm white,

858
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,139
and I'm married to a Dutch girl.

859
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,376
I've got some biases that
may affect me, alright,

860
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:33,511
just a couple and so
I've gotta figure out how

861
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,047
to defeat those so that
they don't bleed over

862
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,982
into my analysis, especially
when we're talking to either

863
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,018
policy-makers or the people
that are on the networks

864
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,352
that we expect to use it.

865
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,221
So we use those models
on both sides really,

866
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,589
but there's different
ways that you would

867
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,323
use them to your point.

868
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:49,193
As far as tools
go, I haven't seen,

869
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,763
I mean there's all your
different, name your platform,

870
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,197
that will do some
different aspects of this.

871
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,901
One of the ones that I
actually liked is Threat_Notes,

872
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,270
so Scott and them
folks have been doing

873
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,772
some really good work with that.

874
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,206
So Threat_Note will allow
you to take indicators

875
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,074
that you have, it's just
a free GitHub script

876
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,710
to get started with
and stuff if you want,

877
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,378
then if you realize you like it,

878
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,980
go talk to vendors
about platforms.

879
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,815
It's usually my big push,

880
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:13,484
and I don't wanna down play
any vendor support here,

881
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,286
but my big push is usually
max out open source,

882
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,989
figure what the value is of
that professional product,

883
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,491
then go to the
professional product,

884
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:23,194
'cause eventually someone's
gonna ask why do we need that,

885
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,429
and if you have them references
and metrics backing it up

886
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,098
of what you did before
the professional product,

887
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,101
you can keep that nice
shiny toy you got,

888
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,769
if you don't, you're
losing it first time

889
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:33,337
there's a budget cut.

890
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,806
So Threat_Note on GitHub is
actually a really good one,

891
00:34:35,806 --> 00:34:37,308
where you take key indicators,

892
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:39,277
you classify 'em based on
the Diamond Model structure,

893
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,612
and there's even a
visual analysis component

894
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,748
of indicators that overlap.

895
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,149
- [Announcer] Last question.

896
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,321
- [Audience Member] You said
generally speaking that people

897
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,190
should not both produce
and consume intelligence,

898
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:55,259
I wanna clarify a little bit.

899
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:00,231
If you primarily
consume, but you also

900
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,402
generate information internally
from attacks that you see

901
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,738
and you document that and
you fit it into the context

902
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,540
of the threat intelligence
that you're consuming,

903
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,443
can you be said
to generate that,

904
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,046
or is that just a
part of consuming?

905
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,481
- I would say that
you're giving off--

906
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,016
so if we go back to that
slide, as we go through here,

907
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,919
alright as we go back
to that slide with that

908
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,123
consume to generate process,
where there's the actual line

909
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,324
that goes back between 'em.

910
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,525
That's what I'm
trying to say here.

911
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,660
We are always involved
in the process.

912
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,895
So all the stuff you do
is going to be coming off

913
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,632
into that generation
of consumption side,

914
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,000
so in my opinion,
you gotta know both.

915
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,735
If you're gonna be
dealing with intel,

916
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,604
you're gonna get swindled
if you don't know

917
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,105
how the hotdogs are made, right?

918
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,341
You gotta understand the
ingredients in the package.

919
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,409
Same way if you're creating
intel and you have no idea how

920
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,845
to do instant response in
security networking monitoring,

921
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,680
you're not gonna
help out your folks.

922
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,616
You gotta actually have
both set of skills.

923
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,317
My point in that, so
thank you for allowing me

924
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,752
the opportunity to clarify.

925
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,121
My point in this, is you really
get to specialize in one.

926
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,190
You're going to be
the team of one.

927
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,925
If you try to be
the team of both,

928
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,061
you're the team that's actually
producing the intelligence

929
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,663
and you think you're
going to consume it,

930
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,965
you also introduce
another bias loop,

931
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,701
where there's no
outside expertise
really looking at that.

932
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,203
So you can get
yourself in a problem

933
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,205
where you run your entire
organization down a lap

934
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:16,007
that they shouldn't
be going down.

935
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,409
And on that point
I'll also note,

936
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,078
that I think generally speaking,

937
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,047
for non-specialized teams, too.

938
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,716
If I go around to most
companies in the world,

939
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,952
the security operations
center, if they have one,

940
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,655
which most don't, is also
doing patch management,

941
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,890
architecture discussions,
the PowerPoint briefings,

942
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,292
three o'clock phone calls,

943
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,394
you can't do all
of that and this.

944
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,395
You've gotta figure out
what your priorities are.

945
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,164
I find most people, if
you go and ask them,

946
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,699
what are your priorities,
they'll give you about 10.

947
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,335
If you've got more than three,
you don't have priorities.

948
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,037
Right, so you gotta figure
out where you wanna play in.

949
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,504
Good point though.

950
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,040
- [Announcer] Alright, that's
gonna do it for questions.

951
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,642
Big round of applause
for Robert and Erick.

952
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,910
(audience applauding)

953
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,314
(epic music)
