1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,136
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,246
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:15,949
- Okay good afternoon.

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,185
Thank you for that
great introduction.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,419
And you did pronounce it right

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,089
so I don't have to
call you Phil Hagen

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,023
for the rest of the conference.

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,193
(people chuckle)

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,329
Welcome to Rising
from the Ashes:

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,164
How do I rebuild a
security program gone wrong

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,033
with a little help
from Taylor Swift.

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,235
As Phil said

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,704
- Click there.
- There we go.

14
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,972
- There we go.
- Nice.

15
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,173
My name is Shelly Giesbrecht.

16
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,841
I'm an Instant
Responder at Cisco.

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,910
I also dabble in
security operations.

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,111
I've been dabbling
for about 10 years now

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,683
and we are really
thrilled to be here today.

20
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,952
It's my third DFIR summit.

21
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,289
It is Mike's first
DFIR Summit, virgin.

22
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,492
(Mike laughs)

23
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,227
So we wanna say thanks for
the SANS Forensics Family

24
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,065
for putting this amazing
event together for us.

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,466
Now those of you
who know me well,

26
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,734
and a few of you do,

27
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,134
I love to talk about
security operations,

28
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,804
about the teams that
I've been a part of,

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,506
and what we do to help
keep our organization

30
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,108
safe and secure.

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,711
So today we've got a slightly
darker topic to talk about.

32
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,047
So I'm really thrilled to
have a really good friend

33
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,983
and learned colleague with
me to talk about that.

34
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,086
- So as everyone was mentioned,

35
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,320
My name's Mike Hracs.

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,955
I'm a member of the
Deloitte Purple Team.

37
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,093
So I do both incident response
and penetration testing

38
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,928
as well as, what Shelly does,

39
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,864
is I dabble in security
operations as well

40
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,200
and I've been dabbling
for about eight years.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,904
So it is my first DFIR Summit
and I'm super excited to be,

42
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,172
not only my first summit

43
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,408
but also speaking at
said first summit.

44
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,843
So I'm super excited.

45
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,744
Without further ado,
let's get started.

46
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,648
- All right so
with data breaches

47
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,550
and our good friend ransomware

48
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,786
so prevalent in the news today,

49
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:05,859
trust, reputation,
and relationships

50
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:09,228
are entangled to the success
of security operations team.

51
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,131
And we posit that
without those things

52
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,899
a security team
really can't function

53
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,068
within a larger organization.

54
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,704
So the question we wanna
talk about today is

55
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,806
what happens when
your organization

56
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,342
undergoes some sort
of major incident?

57
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,145
Whether that's some
sort of data breach,

58
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,280
other negative brand
impacting event

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,849
or maybe the security
team has lost the trust

60
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,018
of the larger organization
for some reason.

61
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,823
- So you have a security
program at your organization.

62
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,126
We wanna talk about
three key things

63
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,129
and some we felt were more
important than others.

64
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,198
Those being people,
process, and technology.

65
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,967
Think to yourselves,
what do you feel

66
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,802
is most important
out of those three?

67
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,839
In all honesty we
believe it's people.

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,744
People is the bedrock
of a good organization,

69
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:00,380
'cause you can have all
the technology in the world

70
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,381
and be no better off.

71
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,448
You can have all the technology

72
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,683
and still all the processes

73
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,084
and your still no better off.

74
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,152
You need people,

75
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,320
You need good people.

76
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,555
People that are willing
to work with you,

77
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,923
adapt with you,
and grow with you.

78
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,558
That is the best way to rebuild.

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,961
- So for security programs
to work, like we said,

80
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,631
you need to have
relationships, but...

81
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,733
Wow!

82
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,403
You know when you fall
right off a cliff?

83
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,905
(Mike laughs)

84
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:30,243
Wow, that went right
out the window!

85
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,214
Sorry folks.

86
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,516
Late night at the
speaker's party last night

87
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,886
and I just totally
lost the plot.

88
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,321
All right, so.

89
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,090
This is a bit of a
darker topic today but

90
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,459
hopefully with a
brighter outcome.

91
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,794
Hopefully we're gonna
sent you guys home

92
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,195
thinking that if this,

93
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,331
if you ever find yourself
in this situation

94
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,533
that you're going to
be able to rise from

95
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,034
the proverbial
ashes like some sort

96
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,936
of crazy security ops phoenix

97
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,572
and regain that trust,

98
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,474
that pride and
those relationships

99
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,976
and become a team that
actually enables business.

100
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,780
- Now we've built
this presentation
with inspiration from

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,249
my gal, Taylor Swift.

102
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,087
A song title of hers fits
with every single subject

103
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,855
that we'll be talking about.

104
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,457
And you may be asking, well why?

105
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,894
Well our answer is
why not? (chuckles)

106
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,197
We do have to put it out
there that neither Shelly

107
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:27,367
nor myself are Swift on
Security, the twitter handle.

108
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,302
Spectacular follow though.

109
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,771
We don't know who runs it
but its worth a follow.

110
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,006
- We were asked a few times.

111
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,474
- Yeah, we were
asked a few times.

112
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,710
So our agenda real quick.

113
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,344
Talking about people,
process, technology.

114
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,513
People of course,
being most important

115
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,580
so we're gonna cover that first,

116
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,750
and finally #winning,

117
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,852
and then we're gonna open
the floor to questions.

118
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,623
- So we're gonna start off
by talking about people

119
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,926
and some of the scenarios
that we find ourselves in

120
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,162
when this sort of thing happens.

121
00:04:56,162 --> 00:05:00,166
So were gonna do some skits
for you today as we go along,

122
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,035
to kind of help you
burn it into your brain.

123
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:02,869
We think they're funny.

124
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,804
Hopefully you will too.

125
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,272
- [Mike] You get to
see some Canadians act.

126
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,407
- That's right.

127
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,907
All the funniest
people are from Canada.

128
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,410
I'm just putting it out there.

129
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,646
Crickets, wow.

130
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,081
(Mike and audience laughs)

131
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,582
so in this first vignette,

132
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,485
Mike will be playing the
role of an infrastructure guy

133
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,553
who's doing a change as part

134
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,455
of a new project
he's working on.

135
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,190
And I will be
playing the bright,

136
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,925
shiny new security
operations analyst

137
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,895
who just wants him to
include a little bit of

138
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,196
security into his change

139
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,598
to make sure that we
don't have to go back

140
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,233
and remediate later because
we've all done that.

141
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,969
Now, the problem is

142
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,839
there is bad blood
between these teams,

143
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,210
because previous security
operations teams did not share

144
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,611
in the goodness that is security

145
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,513
with other teams
in the environment.

146
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,983
And so Mike never, ever, ever
wanted to have a relationship

147
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,486
with Shelly and
security ever again.

148
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,320
Let's watch.

149
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,189
Hey Mike.

150
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,023
- Hey.

151
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,291
- So we haven't met yet.

152
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,226
I'm the new security person.

153
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,928
I understand you
re doing a change.

154
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,996
And I was just wondering if
I could have a look at it

155
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,664
real quick from a
security perspective

156
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:09,469
and you know, just check it out?

157
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,338
- I'm not sure what
you're talking about.

158
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,073
I don't have a change.

159
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,007
- Really?

160
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,309
- Yeah, I mean, no offense.

161
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,811
Well kind of offense,
but you guys suck.

162
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,078
You guys get in our way.

163
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,614
The security team, historically,

164
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,116
has just gotten in our way
and delayed stuff for us.

165
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,485
So, I don't know what you're
talking about, no change.

166
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,620
- Ouch.

167
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,426
For security to work you
gotta have the relationships.

168
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:37,930
So if you're the new kid on
the block like I am at Cisco.

169
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,432
I've been there for
seven weeks now,

170
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,302
it's really, really tempting
to charge in and show them

171
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,505
what a great hire you
were with your wisdom

172
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,707
and your ideas and this
is how we used to do it

173
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,075
at my old job.

174
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,109
I hate that phrase.

175
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,915
So when you do that and
you charge in that way,

176
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,585
there may be some bad blood
happening between old teams.

177
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,555
And you need to figure
out what went wrong,

178
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,257
because at the end of the day,

179
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,760
enforcing security
for security's sake,

180
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,896
or without any explanation

181
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,465
or as to why to why not
it might enable business,

182
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,200
is not gonna make
you any friends

183
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,868
and it's a recipe for disaster.

184
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,637
You will end up
eating lunch alone.

185
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,573
- (chuckles) That's true.

186
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,409
So we wanted to break
the people subject

187
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,712
into three separate
individual kind of topics.

188
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,249
Transparency, involvement,
and accountability.

189
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,684
We feel that these three

190
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,554
ideals are good for a
security operations team.

191
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:39,692
transparency being, be open
about what you're doing

192
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,028
security does not mean secret,

193
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,329
not always secret.

194
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,835
When you have your
user's eyes opened

195
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:52,671
to the world of security

196
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,475
they're more interested
than you may think they are.

197
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,343
If they're interested
in security

198
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,346
they can potentially become
your entire blue team.

199
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,583
And again this leads
right into involvement

200
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,653
by involving your user
group, your IT crew,

201
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:12,658
all of them, you're enabling
themselves to be your blue team

202
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,295
so that they can help
secure your environment

203
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,364
by thinking security.

204
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,799
And then finally accountability.

205
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,370
You have to be accountable
for your organization

206
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,938
from a security perspective.

207
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,940
But you are going to be the guy

208
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,010
that accidentally
blocks reddit.com.

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,444
That's a bad change.

210
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,047
That's a bad accident but
you're gonna find out real quick

211
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,783
'cause, speaking from
personal experience,

212
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,284
that, whoa, we made a little bit

213
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,752
of a too restrictive change.

214
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,222
So you have to be accountable
towards your users.

215
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,127
- Oops, wrong way.
- That's backwards.

216
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,960
- There we go.

217
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,099
Now I'm not gonna ask for
anybody to raise their hand,

218
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,834
but I think at some
point in our lives,

219
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,969
we've all tried to get
back together with someone.

220
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:01,707
Don't raise your hand.

221
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,245
But what that really entails is

222
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,080
one, earning trust,

223
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,717
and two, not keeping secrets
from each other, right?

224
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,788
So how would our previous
skit have gone differently?

225
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,491
Hey Mike?

226
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,192
So I understand you're
doing a change this weekend.

227
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,995
And I was just wondering if
I could have a look at it

228
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,665
to make sure that you got
the right security baked in?

229
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,498
- Absolutely.

230
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,967
You know what?

231
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,169
I was bringing in this change
to the security team here

232
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,871
'cause I don't really
know what I'm looking at.

233
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,805
I don't know what to do,

234
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,073
how to secure this environment,

235
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,309
or even make sure that
it's properly secured.

236
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,810
So I would love it if I
could get your review.

237
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,179
- That's amazing.

238
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,280
You know what?

239
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,749
Because, Mike,
security's for everyone.

240
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,685
- It's true. (chuckles)

241
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,420
- Now, as the slide says,

242
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,690
Trust is hard won and
it is also easily lost.

243
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,795
Teams with a secretive
reputation cannot
build and maintain

244
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,598
relationships with other
teams within the business.

245
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,166
So you wanna make sure that,

246
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,137
just like Rick Astley,
your teams know.

247
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,372
- [Mike] We don't have audio.

248
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,208
- We don't have audio.

249
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,709
♪ Never gonna give you up ♪

250
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,211
♪ Never gonna let you down ♪

251
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,547
- Everyone participate.
(Mike laughs)

252
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,748
Wow!

253
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,849
- [Mike] That's all
right, that's all right.

254
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,317
- Okay.

255
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,587
Which leads us into process.

256
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,622
Mike, explain to us
the idea of process.

257
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,557
- Perfect.

258
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,826
So within your organization,

259
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,027
if you have an incident,

260
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
how are you going
to identify that?

261
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,665
How are you gonna define that?

262
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:37,236
Who is the original
notification of said incident?

263
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,939
Your organization, think
of it as a haystack

264
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,174
and you've got a bunch of
needles in said haystack

265
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,476
and you're gonna start
pulling out those needles.

266
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,077
But which one's the right one?

267
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:49,148
Which one's, you know,
which, you know, sorry.

268
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,983
When you've gotten all the
needles out of that haystack,

269
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,251
you've got another
pile of needles.

270
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,553
Which one's the right
needle to look for?

271
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,656
In other words, don't go crazier

272
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,089
by trying to figure that out.

273
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,093
You need, yeah.

274
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,130
I have also totally
lost where I am.

275
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,032
So,

276
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,868
yeah, it's the skit.

277
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:12,104
So I am the CIO of
said organization.

278
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,472
We're gonna call
it Super Mega Core.

279
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,007
- [Shelly] Super Mega Core.

280
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:19,178
- (laughs) We have a client
that called in and they said

281
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,614
they can't order our widgets
and they're really upset.

282
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,882
- [Shelly] They're
awesome widgets.

283
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,382
- Awesome widgets
by the way, yeah.

284
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,286
So I'm gonna approach Shelly
who is our incident responder,

285
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,887
our 3D operations analyst and

286
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,323
figure out if she can
find out what's going on.

287
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,925
Hey, Shelly,

288
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,126
- What's up Mr. X?

289
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,095
- I got a phone call
from one of our clients

290
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,630
and he's states
that he can't order

291
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,131
any widgets off our website.

292
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,065
- Oh that's bad.

293
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:41,100
- Yeah that's totally bad.

294
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,068
They see there's
something wrong.

295
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,270
The website's maybe down?

296
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,707
Would you be able to kind of
go through the process there

297
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,643
and tell us who,
what, why, where?

298
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,012
You know, the big questions?

299
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,946
- Man, I really feel like

300
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,816
I should've known
that already, right?

301
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,718
Web Server.

302
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,354
Okay, so the team leader
of that team is new.

303
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,856
I haven't met him yet.

304
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,724
I don't have his number.

305
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,992
I'ma have to look that up.

306
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,130
They might have made a change.

307
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,064
I think I heard
something about that

308
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,299
in the lunchroom this week.

309
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,533
You know what?

310
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,602
I'm gonna get back
to you on that.

311
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,905
It might, a couple
of hours, tops.

312
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,674
We'll get right on that.

313
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:26,679
- (chuckles) Now, yes it's
a skit, it's kinda funny.

314
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,548
But if that happened
in the real world,

315
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,452
which is possible, how
differently could this have gone

316
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,722
if we had a fully
populated CMDV,

317
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,191
we had a list of who's on call,

318
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,926
we had a list of changes,

319
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,562
the security group was involved

320
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,564
in change management
process reviews

321
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,799
and everything like that?

322
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,236
Our corporate environments are

323
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,338
always in a constant
state of flux.

324
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,973
How can you defend a network

325
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,175
if you don't know what it looks
like at any point in time?

326
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,612
Again don't go crazier
trying to figure that out.

327
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,816
- Process.

328
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,317
Process is good.

329
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,320
Process tells everybody what
they need to do and when.

330
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,688
It's called rules
and responsibilities.

331
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,790
And we're gonna say
that quite a bit,

332
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,958
rules and responsibilities.

333
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,728
Documented processes are
also repeatable which means

334
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,430
you can do the same
thing over and over again

335
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,402
or tweak them if you need
to and do them again.

336
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,005
Now processes are also auditable

337
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,640
which means that those
people that come and tell you

338
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,308
whether you're doing
something right or wrong

339
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,378
can actually come and see
what you did on paper,

340
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,247
how you did what you did as
opposed to just giving you an X,

341
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,082
because you don't know,

342
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,717
you can't show
them what you did.

343
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,589
Documented rules and
responsibilities help

344
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,492
not just the security team
but across your enterprise,

345
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,661
'cause it helps reduce
errors and duplications

346
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,563
and it enhances
everyone's understanding

347
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,132
of what's trying
to be accomplished.

348
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:53,965
So

349
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,203
at Super Mega Corp,

350
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,540
the team lead of
the web team is new.

351
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,243
And he's not quite sure
what their processes are.

352
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,880
Hey Mike, I'm Shelly.

353
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,782
I'm the security ops team lead.

354
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,717
- Awesome, nice to meet you.

355
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,419
- So we have a problem
with the website.

356
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,587
- Okay.

357
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,755
- I think we've isolated
it to one server.

358
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,891
I need you to take that
one server out of rotation,

359
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,827
so that we can have
a quick look at it.

360
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,563
But the CIO has
said, you know what,

361
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,098
the website has to
stay up, no downtime.

362
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:27,933
We can do that, right?

363
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,635
That's not a problem?

364
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,402
- Maybe.

365
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,609
I can't say for sure but

366
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,111
I've only been here for
a short period of time.

367
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,846
There's no process
that's outlined

368
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,082
to take one server
out of that farm,

369
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,617
but I mean they were designed

370
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,620
with full redundancy
and everything, so

371
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,389
right now, if we're
already having a problem,

372
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,725
what's a little bit
more downtime gonna be?

373
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,560
Let's test it out, let's try it.

374
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,697
- Is that the answer that
the CIO wants to hear?

375
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,399
Definitely not.

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,371
So processes not only help
the security operations team,

377
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,140
they help beyond that
into the business.

378
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,175
Because especially when you
have to know the requirements

379
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,078
of your business, like uptime.

380
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,015
Those are big things,
we serve the business.

381
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,084
So you wanna make sure to reduce

382
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,819
the frustration in
your environment,

383
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,887
that you get those
processes documented,

384
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,191
that you practice them
so that you can just

385
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,494
shake it off and get on with it.

386
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,401
- Now with said process,

387
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,902
your people need to
know what they're doing,

388
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,873
how to do it, where to
go, what to look for.

389
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:45,778
That allows, well,
smooth operations for
your security team.

390
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,747
And when you are responding

391
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,951
it'll make it significantly
faster and better.

392
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,722
Sorry.

393
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,156
- [Shelly] It's
sweeter than fiction.

394
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,060
- It is, it is significantly
sweeter than fiction.

395
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,127
(chuckles) Thank you, Shelly.

396
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,630
(Shelley chuckles)

397
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,001
Now in this one I'm going
to be approaching Shelly

398
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,136
and she is the security manager.

399
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,972
She's the team leader,

400
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,308
she's the big head honcho.

401
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,544
- No one believes that.
(Mike laughs)

402
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,247
- So, I need to quickly ask
you for a couple updates

403
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,248
'cause I need to report them up.

404
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,284
So, hey Shelly.

405
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,552
- Hey.

406
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,586
- I'm wondering if
you would be able

407
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,356
to give me some updates?

408
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,359
Give us a rundown on what
your security team's doing,

409
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,260
what everybody's looking at.

410
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,364
Is everyone utilized
appropriately?

411
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,066
- Cool, when do
you need that by?

412
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,735
- The end of the day.

413
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,635
It's 9 a.m. right?

414
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,069
- Okay, yeah.

415
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,940
We've got the incident
thing going on.

416
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,642
And I'll have to get
an update on that.

417
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,845
I haven't talked to those
guys in a couple of hours.

418
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,347
Got a couple of projects,

419
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,716
and then there's the daily
stuff the guys are doing.

420
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,452
(sighs) End of day, hey?

421
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,253
Tomorrow morning
would be better.

422
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,156
Yeah, that'd be good.

423
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:04,956
Good talk.

424
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,327
- Now if that was me
in that situation,

425
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,030
my frustration would
be rising very quickly.

426
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,867
It shows again, a lack of roles

427
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,101
and responsibilities
being defined.

428
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,404
There's no reporting.

429
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,772
There's nothing really there.

430
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:23,442
So again, if that did exist,

431
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,544
your team would run
smoother than fiction.

432
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,481
Sweeter than fiction is
what I should've said.

433
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,918
- So now we get to
the good part, right?

434
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,254
Because we're all geeks
and we love our toys.

435
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:37,589
- [Mike] I love technology.

436
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,756
- I love technology.

437
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,994
- (laughs) So you've
got technology

438
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,530
inside of your organization
and it's a requirement.

439
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,964
You need that.

440
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,934
You can't really protect
your organization without it.

441
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,803
So if you have

442
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,174
low hanging fruit,
major threats,

443
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,509
there's all these risks
that you've identified,

444
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,746
you need to choose the
lowest hanging fruit

445
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,516
and pick a technology
that covers that.

446
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,053
Don't just buy it to have it.

447
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,856
Everybody loves to
have all the things

448
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,660
but for technology that's
not always the case.

449
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,130
Your attacker is going to
send a horse and carriage

450
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,500
to your proverbial castle
to try and breach it

451
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,836
and if I can get in with
said horse and carriage,

452
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,671
they're not gonna
send anything else.

453
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,972
It's cheap, it's easy, quick.

454
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,575
We'll just maintain
our persistence there.

455
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,643
So when buying technology,

456
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,915
plan it appropriately, test
it, everything like that.

457
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,749
So (chuckles).

458
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,053
- [Shelly] There has been--

459
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,088
Oh, that's we're gonna continue,

460
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,124
the slide doesn't change.

461
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,358
So Shelly.

462
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,960
- Yes.

463
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,262
- We've got a big wad of
budget at end of the year

464
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,531
and we need to spend it
or else we're not gonna,

465
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,764
we're not gonna be able to.
- Budget happy dance.

466
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,000
- Yeah, budget is
awesome, right?

467
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,072
So we need some technology
and we need to purchase it

468
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,341
for our environment, because
we don't spend our budget,

469
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,841
we're not gonna get
as much next year.

470
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,312
What do we need
that we don't have?

471
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,548
- So, let's see.

472
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,216
Malware Sandboxing
would be cool.

473
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,150
- Cool.

474
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,418
- We've been throwing around

475
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,486
Application Whitelisting
for the servers.

476
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,825
Oh I got it, I got it.

477
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,093
I went to this demo last week.

478
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:21,927
- Okay.

479
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,761
- Demo was killer.

480
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,429
Big Red

481
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,798
Next Gen

482
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,734
Find Evil Button.

483
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,735
Bang.

484
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,968
- And it's just a button?

485
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,171
How does that fit
in our environment?

486
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,338
- It finds evil.

487
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,574
- Hey, I'm sold.

488
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,109
- Exactly.

489
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,443
- We might as well go out
and buy all those things.

490
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,278
Give it a try.

491
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,585
When you have all
said technology,

492
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,388
remember you're not
out of the woods

493
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,424
just because you have
implemented this.

494
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,860
You have to secure
it, configure it,

495
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,262
and make sure that somebody
knows how to run it.

496
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,798
And even then, let's be honest,

497
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:02,000
we know you're still
not out of the woods yet

498
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,101
when that's been done.

499
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,244
The last piece about technology.

500
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,287
With the three things
that we've discussed,

501
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,323
people, process, and technology,

502
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,627
we feel that's gonna make you
significantly more secure,

503
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,396
it's gonna give your team
the ability to respond,

504
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,132
and that's just
gonna make things run

505
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:35,400
significantly smoother.

506
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,872
Now, we've implemented our
Big Red Next Generation

507
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,075
Find Evil Button.

508
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,543
Let's find out how that went.

509
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,811
Hey Shelly,

510
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,780
I know we didn't have
much time for the guys,

511
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,983
but I'm hoping you can
give me some update

512
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,484
on the technology we bought.

513
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,820
- Yeah, so first some bad news.

514
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,422
The application whitelisting
for the servers,

515
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,593
we bought that, and
the server guys said

516
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,161
we can't implement it

517
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:08,100
because we didn't ask
them first and we suck.

518
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,368
- Ouch.

519
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,735
- So, yeah, not surprising.

520
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,604
But

521
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,142
Big Red Next Generation
Find Evil Button.

522
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,377
It came,

523
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,345
there was a quick start
guide from the vendor.

524
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:24,316
So we just plugged
it in, lit up.

525
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,019
I go in there and I push
it about five times a day.

526
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,754
It has found nothing.

527
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,323
We are super secure.

528
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,557
- I like it.

529
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,759
That makes me feel
very comfortable

530
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,195
and I feel like we
are out of the woods.

531
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,964
As we had mentioned,

532
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,933
out of the box does not
always mean secured.

533
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:42,768
- What?

534
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:43,869
- No, it's true.

535
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,738
(Mike laughs)

536
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,607
When you buy technology,

537
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,176
it's awesome and it's
always fun to play with,

538
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,678
but out of the box,

539
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,846
you need to configure it and
secure it for your environment,

540
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,983
for your needs, for your gaps.

541
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,518
And that's that.

542
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,454
- All right.

543
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,990
First of all when we were
writing this presentation,

544
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,660
I cannot literally separate
hashtag from winning.

545
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,162
I blame Charlie Sheen.

546
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,263
#Winning.

547
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,265
So I'm gonna recap some
of those song titles

548
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,300
that we talked about.

549
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,768
Bring the home a little bit.

550
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,003
Hopefully burn it into your
brain for the ride home.

551
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,237
and whenever you get
back to work on Monday

552
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,241
or a week from now if you're
staying for a class, hopefully.

553
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,879
Now in life and in our work,

554
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,414
we frequently come
across situations

555
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,882
where through fault of our own

556
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,618
or through fault of other
people or previous incidents.

557
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:36,722
there is bad blood, there is
anger, there is resentment,

558
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,191
there is downright
dislike between folks.

559
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,226
And then when that happens,

560
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,461
we need to take a step back,

561
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,796
we need to figure
out what's going on

562
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,366
and how do we bring it back?

563
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,567
Because at the end of the day,

564
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,103
the last thing you
want is for other teams

565
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,105
in your environment to
never ever ever want

566
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,941
to have a relationship with
you and the security team,

567
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,744
because it makes our jobs
harder to do everyday.

568
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,749
Now that said, in the
words of a very wise woman,

569
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,552
"Haters gonna hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate."

570
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,255
But we think those
people are the exception.

571
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,594
People in your organization
do not want to hate security,

572
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,697
they simply have not been
given the opportunity

573
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,930
to understand in it,

574
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,500
to sharing in it and
to appreciate it.

575
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,003
A truly wise man once said,

576
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,539
"Be the change you want
to see in the world."

577
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,642
And I think that applies
to our work as well.

578
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,345
You need to help the
people in your organization

579
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:37,015
from IT to business and
users to executives,

580
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:41,119
have their eyes opened to
how amazing security is

581
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,288
and how integral it
is to their success

582
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,524
by practicing transparency,

583
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,626
letting them understand
what you're doing.

584
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,230
You also need to be
involved in the organization

585
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,600
and how that runs and
let the organization

586
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,069
be involved in a
security program.

587
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,238
And lastly your
security practice

588
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,840
should be accountable
for what you do.

589
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,974
Security should never be able

590
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,311
to just do stuff and walk away.

591
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,450
We believe that
people are the bedrock

592
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,318
of a good security program.

593
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,987
So you wanna make sure
that you counterparts in IT

594
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,456
in the business understand

595
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,091
that you are never gonna give
them up or let them down,

596
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,895
at least not on purpose and
not without trying hard.

597
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,467
Being a trusted core partner
of the larger organization

598
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,869
should be the goal of
any security program.

599
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:37,141
- Perfect.

600
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,879
So we're covering
don't go crazier

601
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,014
trying to figure
out your processes.

602
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,417
Shake it off when you're
starting to get issues,

603
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,654
and when your security
operations team
can run smoothly,

604
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,956
it's sweeter than fiction.

605
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,259
And then finally,

606
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,561
when you have that technology
implemented correctly,

607
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,662
you are safe and sound

608
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,532
and then you can be
out of the woods.

609
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,568
- Now, change is
defined as the act

610
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,137
or instance of making different.

611
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,874
So we wanna make sure that

612
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,443
when we have all of
these things in place

613
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,610
we need to find good people,

614
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,680
document and deliver
our processes.

615
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,249
We need to implement
the right technologies

616
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,451
or what works fast
now and in the future,

617
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:23,121
and suddenly you will find
that everything has changed.

618
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:27,759
- And with that,

619
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,660
Thank you.

620
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,663
(suspenseful music)
