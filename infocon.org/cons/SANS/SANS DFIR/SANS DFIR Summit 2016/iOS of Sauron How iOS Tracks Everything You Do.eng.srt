1
00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,570
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,247
(Applause)

3
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,351
- Thank you Heather.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,820
All right welcome to
the iOS of Sauron,

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,522
nerdy referenced there, right.

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,891
How iOS tracks
everything that you do.

7
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,727
A little bit about
myself like Heather said,

8
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,963
I really like Mac stuff.

9
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:30,997
I do like to test it.

10
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,531
If it has a piece of fruit on it

11
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,733
I'm going to buy it it.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,300
It doesn't matter what it is,

13
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,905
I will put all the money I
have towards Apple products

14
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,475
in the name of research,
as I like to say.

15
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,378
I am author instructor
of Forensics 518

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,714
which is gonna be
held this next week

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,582
so if you want to hang
out for this summit

18
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,018
a little bit longer go
ahead and take the class

19
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,155
but I do have a few other
classes up there as well.

20
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,357
And I have my
contact information

21
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,626
which will also be
on the last slide.

22
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,361
Just a word of note here,

23
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,062
the slides are
already available.

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,732
This is a condensed version
of this presentation

25
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,369
because I do have to do
within 20 25 minutes.

26
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,371
So the slides that are
available on my website

27
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,374
or my Github are
quite a bit more.

28
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,109
A little bit more lengthy.

29
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,211
So it's got a little
bit more stuff to it.

30
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,681
So what I want to
talk about here

31
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,583
is pattern of life.

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,351
So we use our iPhones.

33
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,087
We use them all the time.

34
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,254
I'm looking at information.

35
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,223
I'm looking at
files and databases

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,326
that can tell a lot about
a certain person's usage.

37
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,928
Of how they use applications.

38
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,863
where are they at a given time.

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,332
Even down to the nitty
gritty little bits

40
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,701
about their life like
their health you know.

41
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,204
What is their heart
rate at a specific time.

42
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,005
Really creepy stuff.

43
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,907
Very interesting stuff as well

44
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,042
that I hope that you
guys can possibly use

45
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,744
in many of your investigations.

46
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,881
So I do have this caveat page.

47
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,685
So I do like to put out
some information in here.

48
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,921
This is a work in progress
type of presentation.

49
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,124
I will be doing more
review of these files.

50
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,357
Looking at different devices

51
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,960
looking at different
iOS versions

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,661
because they all do tend to be

53
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,097
a little bit different
here and there.

54
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,899
Before the purpose
of this presentation,

55
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,169
this is on my iPhone
6 and my Apple watch.

56
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,370
So these are my devices.

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,672
This is my data
that you're seeing.

58
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,008
I'd also like to say that
this is a jailbroken.

59
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:24,911
jailbroken files.

60
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,613
So most of these files,

61
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,314
minus maybe one database

62
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,718
is only accessible on
a jailbroken device.

63
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,986
your cellebrites your xoys

64
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,421
your whatever other
mobile device tools

65
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,890
are not going to pull
this information.

66
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,525
These are fairly
very protected files

67
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,060
that is not.

68
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,930
They are not backed up with
like an iTunes style backup.

69
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,798
So just be aware of that.

70
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,201
The timestamps I've learned

71
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,737
with doing the research
for this presentation,

72
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,273
do not implicitly
trust the timestamps.

73
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,707
Some of them are way
off and I'll show you

74
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:56,075
a few examples of those.

75
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,011
Always always test.

76
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,213
Data retention for some
of these databases,

77
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,882
it could be anything
from an hour to a day

78
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,951
to a month to a week you know.

79
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,186
All these things different.

80
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,321
I try to mark it in
here as best as I can.

81
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:12,992
So for the documentation
portion of this,

82
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,862
I do have these file
paths and files on here.

83
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,498
I'd like to say that this
is only an introduction

84
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,768
to a fraction of the data
that's actually available

85
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,071
in most of these databases a
tiny tiny tiny little subset.

86
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,541
There's so much information
that hasn't been reported on

87
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,043
that are stored in
these databases.

88
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,978
So I encourage you to
take a look at these

89
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,514
on some of your own devices
or your test devices

90
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,950
to get more
information from there.

91
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,851
The ones highlighted in
pink are some of the ones

92
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,653
I'm going to be
talking about today

93
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,888
and you'll notice
the table counts

94
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,824
specifically current power log

95
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,259
down there at the bottom.

96
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,262
There are 257 tables
within this one database.

97
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,865
There is a crazy amount
of information to be had.

98
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,170
and another slide here just
for documentation purposes.

99
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,140
So let's get into it let's talk
about some application usage

100
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,678
How are the users using
their various applications.

101
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,581
Are there third-party
applications, let's say.

102
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,850
So if we go into this
battery settings page,

103
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,352
it'll take a few minutes

104
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,254
but you'll finally get this
other screen that pops up

105
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,221
showing the percentage of usage.

106
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:18,358
Now you can get it on
a last 24 hour basis

107
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,927
or a last 7 day basis.

108
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,462
Now if you're
looking at this GUI

109
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,131
you're saying okay this
information has to be stored

110
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,933
on the device somewhere.

111
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,436
So I went ahead and
found that information.

112
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,070
That information is being stored

113
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:36,009
in the current power
log pl/sql database.

114
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,610
This is a very very
large database.

115
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,414
This is the over 250
table type database.

116
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,116
So this one is
storing information

117
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,619
about the background and
screen time of an application.

118
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,722
So how long was the user
looking at this application for.

119
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,657
How long was it
on the screen for.

120
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,128
So it stores it for
about two weeks.

121
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,263
Power log has
archive files as well

122
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,332
so you get about two
weeks and five days

123
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,167
worth of information

124
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,402
and the time stamps
do tend to be accurate

125
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,271
for this particular one.

126
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:07,073
So on the left or the
right hand side here

127
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,474
got your time stamp,

128
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,075
a background and screen time

129
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,811
and the bundle ID.

130
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,080
Bundle ID is basically
which application

131
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,215
or which process
is actually running

132
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,750
for this particular one here.

133
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,287
So I can take this information

134
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,289
and I can correlate it and
do some analysis on it.

135
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,992
So on the left hand
side here I have this

136
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,594
PLAppTimeService_Aggregate_AppRe

137
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,231
they're all named these very
strange names for these tables

138
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,701
but I'm sorting
it by screen time.

139
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,402
So I do a lot of twittering.

140
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,337
A crazy amount of Twitter.

141
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,806
I'm always on it.

142
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,241
So you can see the screen
time is right at the top there

143
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,612
for the Twitter application
comm that 8 bits that Tweety2

144
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,115
and then overdrive anybody
know what overdrive is?

145
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,818
It's like audible
for library books.

146
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,253
I have a lengthy commute,

147
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,122
so I like to listen to
a lot of audiobooks.

148
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,557
mobile mail,

149
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,926
SMS, Facebook so
on and so forth.

150
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,794
I also did the same
thing for background time

151
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,262
on the other side.

152
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,264
so background time
is just you know

153
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,466
which application is taking

154
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,935
the most background
time usage here.

155
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,703
It was kind of
interesting to see

156
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,673
they call that Apple
Safari view service

157
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,441
taking up most of that time.

158
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,845
It's kind of this weird
obscure process for Safari.

159
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,948
So I thought that was
kind of interesting.

160
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,717
Now my favorite

161
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,687
or one of my favorite analysis

162
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,857
is this app by app or excuse me

163
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,960
app usage by hour or by app.

164
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,128
So on the left hand side here

165
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,899
I was curious to see you
know which time of day

166
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,001
so say April 10th at 10 o'clock

167
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,236
that particular hour of the day

168
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,140
which application was
being used the most

169
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,875
and of course for
me it's Twitter.

170
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,545
So at 10 o'clock in the morning
on any given day you know

171
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,448
I tend to be using Twitter
especially on the weekends

172
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,015
on the right-hand side

173
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,685
you can do it on a
per application basis.

174
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,355
So if I want to look at
how when did I use Twitter

175
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,558
for any particular day
an hour I can sort it by

176
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,561
just that bundle ID for
that Twitter application

177
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,563
or Facebook or what-have-you

178
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,132
to see what hours of
the day I was using

179
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:14,667
this particular application.

180
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,675
Now we can also take this
and kind of graph it.

181
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,177
So I take this

182
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,746
we saw the screenshot on the
left hand side here before

183
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,748
it's showing the screen time
for a particular application

184
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,918
Now if we put it into
a graphical sense

185
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,519
you can see that
I really do spend

186
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,221
way too much time on Twitter.

187
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,790
It is much larger
than most of the other

188
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,392
applications on there.

189
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,895
Now I just took this out
and threw it into numbers

190
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,597
and just did a nice graph there.

191
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,364
You could do a lot
of interesting...

192
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,167
a lot of different
visualizations I think

193
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:51,537
with this data if you were
if you wanted to do so.

194
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,907
You've got my commute there.

195
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,376
Apple fit call that
Apple Fitness health.

196
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,212
This is when I was
doing some research,

197
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,347
so I had that screen
open quite a bit

198
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,647
and of course you
have to procrastinate

199
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,650
when you're putting a
presentation together.

200
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,619
So of course on Twitter

201
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,423
looking at my RSS feeds on
Feedly and Facebook of course.

202
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,628
Now one of my favorites is what
I call the app play-by-play

203
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,564
This is tracking for about a day

204
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,100
each application that
the user has opened

205
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,768
one after another after another.

206
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,736
So you get this information for

207
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,341
about one day's worth of data.

208
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,643
So if I'm looking
at say April 11th

209
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,978
which applications
was I using you know.

210
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,347
Basically you're
going back and forth

211
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,616
between apps and
the home screen.

212
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:38,518
This is part of my testing.

213
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,555
Now this is where the
timestamps were really weird

214
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,656
and I can't quite
explain why they were

215
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,193
but they were a solid nine
minutes and 20 seconds

216
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,761
off of the actual time.

217
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,131
I was watching these entries
being created in the database

218
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,232
you know with my watch

219
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,267
I'm like what's going on here.

220
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,138
So do not implicitly
trust your timestamps.

221
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,774
Always test to make sure.

222
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,009
It's kind of strange.

223
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,843
I just want to put
that out there.

224
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,077
some are quite accurate

225
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,012
some are not.

226
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,348
So the next topic I'd
like to talk about

227
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,516
is device state.

228
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,985
Now device state,

229
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,520
I'm gonna be talking about

230
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,088
some of the more physical
attributes of this device.

231
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,557
So lock state.

232
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,192
when the device was
locked versus unlocked

233
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:24,096
and it's a simple binary value
0 is unlocked 1 is locked.

234
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,164
So you can see when the user

235
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,033
was potentially using the device

236
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,703
versus maybe when it was just
locked and in their pocket.

237
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:33,472
I took out two different
time stamps here.

238
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,876
So with these tables you get
the time stamps are stored

239
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,877
in a couple of
different formats.

240
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,415
You usually see UNIX epoch but
you might also see mac epoch

241
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,784
which is why I have
an example of it here.

242
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,119
So just be aware of
the time stamp format

243
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,588
when you're looking at these.

244
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,957
Now this one is kind of neat

245
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,758
because it actually
stores the time zone.

246
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,828
So if you're interested in
when the user is traveling

247
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:57,329
maybe across time zones

248
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,966
it's a potential way to also
view that data in here as well

249
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,171
This is quite sensitive

250
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,340
I'll be on yeah

251
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,976
Troy was quite right with that.

252
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,911
So battery level.

253
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,478
so battery level
can be indicative

254
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,748
of usage throughout
the day right.

255
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,284
So if I take this
battery level and we got

256
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,687
PL battery agent event
backward battery table,

257
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,390
it's storing the level
at certain frequencies.

258
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,824
Or at certain time periods.

259
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,594
But you see it's it's
storing it with a level

260
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:29,962
and a raw level.

261
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,497
Which is kind of interesting.

262
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,897
The level is actually what's
being presented to the user

263
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,167
you know in the upper
right hand corner

264
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,070
while the raw level
can sometimes be
quite a bit different

265
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,739
than what's actually
presented to the user.

266
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,408
So I found that to
be quite interesting.

267
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,410
Now I can graph this out.

268
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,478
And this is one of my days.

269
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,780
I start at about

270
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,318
looks like about
midnight to about

271
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,020
it's about a day's and
a half worth of data.

272
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,155
'til about 11:00
o'clock the next day.

273
00:10:57,723 --> 00:10:59,324
So I wake up in the
middle of the night

274
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,127
I can't sleep right you know

275
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,661
what do I do I get on Twitter

276
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,996
I check Twitter
and see what's up.

277
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,231
check Facebook.

278
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,966
So you can see a
little blip there.

279
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,502
I took it off the charger
and actually see a little

280
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,238
little battery usage there.

281
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,639
I used a little
bit in the morning.

282
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,074
I did finally get some sleep.

283
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,142
So I used it in the
morning and then I used it

284
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,411
plugged it back into the charger

285
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,945
because I knew I was
gonna have a fairly

286
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,948
phone intensive day.

287
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,552
I used to quite
heavily that day.

288
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:31,057
You can actually just see it
drop to about almost 50% there

289
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,325
and then I finally put
it back on the charger

290
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,362
and charge it for the
rest of the evening.

291
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,031
So you can see when the
user is really using it.

292
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,032
It does get to be
quite interesting.

293
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,871
Now another one that I like
to show you is plugins state.

294
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
plugins state might
not be that interesting

295
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,742
but it still shows a pattern
of life detail to it.

296
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,113
So this is a little story
of my one of my normal days.

297
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,648
you know, commuting from work.

298
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,319
So a plug in state basically
0 is unplugged 1 is plugged in

299
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,520
and this is through
the Lightning port

300
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,456
on the bottom of the phone.

301
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,424
So I'm right in the
beginning of the day

302
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,326
about 7:42 in the morning,

303
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,028
I unplugged it from my charger.

304
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,529
My bedside charger.

305
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,631
So I'm eventually
going to go to work.

306
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,367
I commute and I listened
to those library books.

307
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,637
So I plug it into my car
into the little car charger

308
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,138
and it shows up in here.

309
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,542
It's what about 7:52 I got
in my car and plugged it in.

310
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,212
Got to work unplugged it.

311
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,447
I got a long commute home,

312
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,450
so at about 17:43 so 5:43

313
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,818
I started my commute home.

314
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,454
So this is a daily
pattern that you can see

315
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,888
over and over and over.

316
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,024
You get multiple
entries sometimes

317
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,793
when it doesn't quite take

318
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,528
and then finally you
can see I plugged it in

319
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:46,398
at about 7:46 to do some more
research for this presentation

320
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,934
so you can correlate
this over you know

321
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,969
at least a month's worth of data

322
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,972
and get this person's
pattern of life you know.

323
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:53,939
When are they home,

324
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,473
when are they in their car.

325
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,910
You can correlate this with
other information as well.

326
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,782
So I like to talk
about health now.

327
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,117
This is where it kind
of gets really creepy.

328
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,920
There's health
applications, you know.

329
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,889
An Apple person
gets an Apple watch.

330
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,423
It's recording your heart rate,

331
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,192
it's recording different steps

332
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:17,196
different other
exercise related items.

333
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,866
So you also get this
activity application as well

334
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,701
and this comes with Apple watch.

335
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,937
Those who don't have an Apple
watch paired will not get this

336
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,306
but you'll still
have that fitness,

337
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,042
the health app as well
that you can look at

338
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,077
and it's storing
information like you know

339
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,680
how many times you know are
you active during the day.

340
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,948
How many times did you stand up

341
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,750
and walk around for a little bit

342
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,520
as well as your
exercise minutes.

343
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,988
You can sort of see in
the third panel there

344
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,323
you have a couple of
different workouts

345
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,925
if you want to do workouts.

346
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,861
So a lot of health-related
data is stored

347
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,496
in these little
health databases.

348
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,966
Now these this data
is actually stored

349
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,169
persistently because it wants to

350
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,238
the user wants to
have access to this

351
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,706
for as long as they can

352
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,409
so they can track their activity
levels and things like that

353
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,678
which means this is
a gigantic database.

354
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,613
I think I extract in
mine and it was about

355
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,348
90 Megs worth of data.

356
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,650
So it is very very large.

357
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,253
Now this is one of the tables

358
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,155
and this is the activity cache.

359
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,424
So this is what's storing
your your brisk minutes

360
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,125
or your energy burned.

361
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,996
Your stand hours goal and
your steps and your distance.

362
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,965
You know your major
health activities

363
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,367
with the little rings.

364
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,238
This walk distance and I'm

365
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,774
I don't know how to
get the thing here

366
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,377
but this walk distance
this column here

367
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,679
I was curious I'm like okay
I know it's this distance

368
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,115
but what is it actually
being stored as.

369
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,186
So I went to one of my
favorite websites WolframAlpha

370
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,188
and started just
plugging in random things

371
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,689
that would make sense

372
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,192
and I know how long like how
long it's a reporting back

373
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,994
to me using the
actual application

374
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,463
I said okay you've
walked seven miles.

375
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,664
it was a good day right.

376
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:02,034
I got to impress people
with my my walking.

377
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,237
That's not normal
for me obviously.

378
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,671
So I walked seven miles,

379
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,108
so I plugged in meters and
miles and finally got something

380
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,578
that represented the
actual information

381
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,281
that was being presented to
me through the GUI itself.

382
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,318
So you got to know how your
data is being stored as well

383
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,020
sometimes you have to do
a little bit of guessing

384
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,089
and that WolframAlpha
helps out quite a bit.

385
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,495
Next one is this
activity samples.

386
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,930
Now if you look at the
seque lite query here

387
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,430
it can be a little daunting.

388
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,401
I think I'm putting together
four or five different tables

389
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,771
because this data is spread
across many many many places

390
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:43,041
to actually get this big old
data base worth of information

391
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:46,111
and to make it have some sense.

392
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,615
Now we have this data types
on the right hand side here.

393
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,552
So data types is what's storing
the various bits of data.

394
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,287
So the weight is being tracked

395
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,056
if they're in
putting their weight.

396
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,490
Nutrition.

397
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,694
If you have certain applications
like dietary applications

398
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,963
hooked up with your
health application.

399
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,664
it'll track you know
how much vitamin C

400
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,865
how many carbohydrates I have.

401
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,634
All that good stuff.

402
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,868
The steps is represented,

403
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,670
the heart rate is represented.

404
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,771
So a lot of different details

405
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,040
and they're all being stored

406
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,343
in this huge huge
sequel lite query.

407
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,444
Which means you get
thousands and thousands

408
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,881
of rows in this
particular query output.

409
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,882
So a lot of information in here

410
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,785
but it can be
potentially useful.

411
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,724
Now one of my favorites
topics to talk about

412
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,658
is location.

413
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,228
I have been kind of obsessed
with looking for locations

414
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,999
on different iPhones
and i devices

415
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,402
to see where can I pull this
location information from.

416
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,572
You know I get asked where was
this person at a certain time

417
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,773
I don't know.

418
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,409
Let me go find some
some areas on the drive

419
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,511
where that can pull
that information from.

420
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,280
So the first one and if nobody

421
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,116
has actually looked at their own

422
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,751
I highly recommend that you do.

423
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,121
First what is called
frequent locations.

424
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:07,026
So this started I believe iOS
7 or iOS 8 I can't recall.

425
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,329
It's basically tracking where
you're going at any given time

426
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,932
So I like to call it frequent
and recent locations.

427
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,868
It basically has a some sort
of algorithm that's unknown

428
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,204
at this time to bubble
up this information

429
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,040
and I'll show you an
example in just a bit.

430
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,575
This is kind of a
big creep factor

431
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,111
when you actually
look at your own.

432
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:28,814
On that left hand
screenshot there

433
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,783
it says 31 minutes to Arlington

434
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,751
traffic is unusually
heavy right now.

435
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,720
I did not request
this information.

436
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,488
It knew that I was leaving work

437
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,824
and it popped this
information up because

438
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,326
it knew I was going
to commute home.

439
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,828
It's called routine D,

440
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,297
the process is actually
called routine.

441
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,598
It knows your routine.

442
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,533
It knows your pattern of life.

443
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,737
Anybody think that might
be a little bit creepy.

444
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,339
Yeah it's good stuff though.

445
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,908
So an example of one of mine.

446
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,777
I go to my frequent locations

447
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:01,113
and it's really hidden
deep down into the GUI.

448
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,681
So it's really hard
for people to find.

449
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,150
but I do have that path up
there so you can find it.

450
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,586
You can see I've been to
Arlington to DC Stafford

451
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,422
Florida, California
and Washington.

452
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,092
You know it gives you
a broad range here.

453
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,726
So if I click
through Washington,

454
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,528
California and Washington,

455
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,097
I've been on South
Disneyland Drive,

456
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,966
176 Street and Airport way.

457
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,938
I can go even further and
get more specific information

458
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,506
like how long was I there

459
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,942
and how many times
was I actually

460
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,977
at that particular location.

461
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,879
It's doing all this
in the background.

462
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,683
So these locations
are being stored

463
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,252
and some of these
encrypted databases.

464
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,322
I use the air quotes because
if you have a jailbroken device

465
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,690
you can get access to
these fairly easily.

466
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,826
You just have to get
that physical access.

467
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,329
So these locations
are being stored

468
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,665
in this cache
encrypted B database.

469
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,601
Now you get this for
about about a day

470
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:58,804
before it gets rolled into
the actual frequent locations

471
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,672
files I'll talk about
in just a second.

472
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,174
You get lats you get longs

473
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,609
altitude and so on.

474
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,212
I can import this information.

475
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,414
I can import this information

476
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,017
into whatever mapping
application you might want.

477
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,453
I chose to Google my
maps for the screenshot

478
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,256
because it just makes
a nice presentation.

479
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,858
so I have a day's
worth of Lat and longs

480
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,793
and I started in the beginning.

481
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,495
I live in Arlington and I
commute down to Stafford

482
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,797
every single day.

483
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,834
So I can actually
plot out my commute

484
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,569
with this application here.

485
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,437
So you see that first
part of my commute.

486
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,306
I go by Arlington Cemetery,

487
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:39,411
I go on 395 and eventually
head down not to 95

488
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,913
which is a very fun drive.

489
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,383
If you're in the DC area you
know how awesome that can be.

490
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,418
I'm opposite traffic though.

491
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,021
Yeah it's still not great.

492
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,858
Now the frequent locations.

493
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,293
So you get these data
points that are stored

494
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,196
in this encrypted
cached b database.

495
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,398
You get them for about a day.

496
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,500
Whatever algorithm
that Apple is using,

497
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,468
it's going to push some
of this information

498
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:07,806
into these state model one
or two dot archive files

499
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,941
dot archive files,

500
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,875
like what is that?

501
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,177
It's actually a plist file

502
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,813
You don't have to have a you
know a plist file extension

503
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,349
to have a plist file.

504
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,384
They're just binary XML files

505
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,453
but these are a
little bit different.

506
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,556
These are NS keyed
archiver plist files.

507
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,925
Has anybody look
at these before?

508
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,360
They are absolutely
awful to look at.

509
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,997
So you think XML you
think key and value

510
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,633
but these NS keyed archiver
property list files

511
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:37,135
are kind of a serialized
version of that.

512
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,604
I have a whole blog
article about it.

513
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,706
How much of a pain
it is to actually

514
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,876
interpret this information
for the analyst itself

515
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,678
but instead of
doing that for these

516
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,281
I actually wrote a script to
parse some of this information

517
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,983
so I can actually pull
it out much quicker

518
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,951
than doing it manually.

519
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,453
So got it up there on my Github

520
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,690
and what it does is it
extracts a CSV or a KML file

521
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,792
and throws it into you
know you could throw it

522
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,061
into whatever mapping
application you want.

523
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,397
The screenshot here I have
an example of Google Earth

524
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,332
and you can see which
locations and where I've been.

525
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,903
I also have a text out

526
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,140
I also have a text output
for this particular one

527
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,110
which just parses the
information in the database.

528
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,946
So the geolocation data blobs

529
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,615
you can sort of see on
the information in there

530
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,019
location data, the visits
the entries, the transitions.

531
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,988
All that information is being
stored within that plist file

532
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,456
which is where the actual GUI

533
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,125
is pulling that
information from.

534
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,194
Now we also have cell locations.

535
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,331
So cell locations
is basically looking

536
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,766
for the locations for
all the cellular towers

537
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,604
through various different
you know different protocols.

538
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,705
So CDMA will have one.

539
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,408
LTE so on and so forth.

540
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,144
So it's storing this
information in these tables

541
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,280
lat and longs as well
as the cellular tower

542
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,782
information as well.

543
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,751
Now the one thing with
the cellular information

544
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,887
that is much less accurate.

545
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,389
So I was only at the
the yellow spot in DC

546
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,893
on this map here but I
was getting the locations

547
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:11,163
for all the cellular
towers all around my area.

548
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,698
So it's a lot more general.

549
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,967
You also get Wi-Fi.

550
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,703
It's doing more driving for you.

551
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,804
How cool is that

552
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,307
So it's storing the
MAC address channels

553
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,642
lat and longs.

554
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,379
That MAC address looks
kind of weird, right?

555
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,514
It's actually storing it in
base 10 which is strange.

556
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,918
So in the calculator app
you can take one of these

557
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,053
or you can do it in any
other format you want

558
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,555
and change it to base 16

559
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:39,257
throw colons in there and
then you're good to go.

560
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,061
You have a have a a MAC address

561
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,529
that looks familiar to you.

562
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,832
I can plug this into
a site called wiggle

563
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,000
and actually plot
the information and
find more information

564
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,571
about you know how long this
access point was around for

565
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,738
so on and so forth.

566
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,476
And of course I just
released a script

567
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,445
called location scraper that
takes a lot of these databases

568
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,947
that I just talked about and
stores all this information

569
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:07,953
or outputs all the information
in XML and KML or CSV.

570
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,756
So you can rip all
these databases out,

571
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,790
run the script on it,

572
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,024
throw it into Google Earth

573
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,226
and look at all this
information out there.

574
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,695
So if that one's already out.

575
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,231
I know the slides say it's
not but it is out now.

576
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,133
I thank you for coming
to the presentation.

577
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,770
If you do have
questions you know,

578
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,905
please I'll be here
pretty much all week.

579
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,841
So feel free to ask
questions whenever you like.

580
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,909
I am looking for
somebody to work with me.

581
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,678
If you do a lot of
Android forensics

582
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,679
come talk to me.

583
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,750
My class my information
is up there.

584
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,087
All my presentations and
scripts that were presented here

585
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,655
are up on the Github.

586
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:44,689
So thank you very much.

587
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,690
So any questions?

588
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,326
- [Man] Do you know
if the the phones

589
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,663
will ever do location
services just by GPS

590
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,899
without relying on
assisted cell tower

591
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,167
or the Wi-Fi.

592
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,635
for example if I'm
in airplane mode

593
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,704
or just try and passively
receive GPS signals.

594
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,639
- Yeah so I've been
meaning to research that

595
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,475
and get a little bit
more detail on it.

596
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,778
I believe even if
you have airport

597
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,346
or what's it called,

598
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,614
airplane mode turned on,

599
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,184
it still does GPS I believe.

600
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,386
But I'd like to test that
across multiple devices

601
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,921
just to be sure

602
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,790
because it might change
on per device per iOS.

603
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,859
So more research to be sure.

604
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,962
- [Man] I noticed when you
brought up the the screenshot

605
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,998
of the power management
application on the iOS

606
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,601
it's very very similar to
the one that's on Android.

607
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,269
Do you know if the
backends are similar

608
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,806
and do any of these other
applications have backends

609
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,341
that are very similar
on the Android side?

610
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,376
- Yes so I get
that question a lot

611
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,744
when I do this presentation.

612
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,947
I do Android forensics.

613
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,514
I don't do it as
much as I do iOS.

614
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,550
I mean iOS is my

615
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,118
I love Apple stuff

616
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,054
but I have been looking at
some of the Android versions

617
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,289
of these databases.

618
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,524
They still have a
health database.

619
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,226
They still have a
location databases.

620
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,595
They're not quite
the same format

621
00:24:56,595 --> 00:25:00,632
but if they're the databases
are here for a purpose right.

622
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,968
So the purpose is to
be useful to the user.

623
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,337
So on the Android side it's
doing a lot of the same thing.

624
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,739
I don't know if it has
like a frequent locations

625
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,575
type of aspect to it

626
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,179
but a lot of the information
or a lot of the usage

627
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,081
could potentially be
found on Android devices.

628
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,917
I just haven't done the
research for that specifically.

629
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,953
One thing I also like to
point out is third-party apps.

630
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,322
So your Fitbit application.

631
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,791
That stores a lot of these
very similar health-related

632
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,993
information in here.

633
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:30,095
So it's not just
native applications.

634
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,931
It could potentially
be third-party
applications as well.

635
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,233
Anyone else?

636
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,501
- [Man] So in situations

637
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,603
where you turn off
location services,

638
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:42,541
how much is that honored?

639
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,377
- As far as I know it's
honored quite well.

640
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,213
Again it's one of those
things I'd like to research

641
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,482
is just have a phone
completely brand new,

642
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:51,950
turn off location services.

643
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,853
Never have it on and see
what's actually being stored

644
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,721
in those location databases.

645
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,125
I won't even guess to how
much would actually be stored

646
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:00,959
until I actually do it.

647
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,460
Again like Heather said,

648
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,930
I'd like to test things
before I actually tell you

649
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,264
whether it's yes or no right.

650
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,600
I know crazy, right?

651
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,135
- [Woman] But then you
can barely use your phone

652
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,803
when you turn the location off.

653
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,871
- I know.

654
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,072
I hate.

655
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,306
It kills me to
turn off locations

656
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,775
but it makes you
paranoid that you

657
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,010
probably actually should
turn off locations

658
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,245
from an OPSEC point of view

659
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,079
and I'm getting the cut off

660
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,313
so thank you.

661
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,449
If you do have other
questions you know

662
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,584
I'll be here all week.

663
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,518
Thank you.

664
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,219
(applause)

665
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,789
(upbeat music)
