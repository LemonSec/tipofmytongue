1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:04,504
(increasingly loud tone)

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,279
(applause)

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,216
- All right, great to
be here this afternoon,

4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,684
thanks so much.

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,820
So, as already said today
I'll be talking about

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,624
incident response playbook
for Android and IOS.

7
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,893
I know that a lot of folks
here have pretty good playbooks

8
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:29,829
for, you know, traditional
computers and servers,

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,965
but mobile's increasingly
a part of our world,

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,566
a part of our life.

11
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,669
My background is again,
co-founder of NowSecure.

12
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:41,107
Starting out, I was
into programming and

13
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,009
about seven years ago
got into mobile security

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,578
when I started the
company, co-founded it.

15
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:48,214
I've written two books, one
on IOS and one on Android.

16
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,885
And there's a third book on
mobile incident response.

17
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,385
We're gonna just
open source that book

18
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,155
so it's sitting
out on our website,

19
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,391
and you can download the
first three chapters now,

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,425
if you're interested.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,129
So I'm gonna talk a little
bit about the challenges

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,965
that you'll face from a
mobile IR perspective.

23
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,967
And I'm gonna spend an
extra couple minutes

24
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,602
on this slide because I
think this really tee's up

25
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,806
the challenge in the
interesting next couple of years

26
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,274
that we're gonna have.

27
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:18,645
So first of all, as a mobile
defender nobody's on your side.

28
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,681
And when I mean nobody,
I mean Apple and Google,

29
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,416
and I'll get into some details.

30
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:28,354
FBI, zero diem, state
sponsors, script kiddies,

31
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,124
everybody is basically
is on this side

32
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,559
and you're on the other side.

33
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,495
And one of the key challenges
that we end up seeing is

34
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:40,500
is that as Apple and Google
make IOS and Android more secure

35
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,471
we actually are getting less
and less data that we need

36
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,507
as defenders, to actually
protect the device.

37
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,610
So some of the earlier talks
today are talking about

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,679
looking at the file
system and creating

39
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,014
rules from the data
that you can generate.

40
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,183
You basically increasingly
don't have access

41
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,185
to that information
on mobile phones.

42
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,588
We can't get list of
installed apps anymore.

43
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:04,190
You can't, it's very
difficult to get net stat.

44
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,928
You can't see a lot of
the data files that exist.

45
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,964
I didn't get to see
Sarah's talk this morning,

46
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,299
there's a lot of information
sitting on the device

47
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,468
that you might be able to
see some of it in the UI

48
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,536
and you simply can't
get your hands on that

49
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,906
as an incident responder.

50
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,877
And so, the challenging
part is that attackers

51
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,612
can go jail break their device.

52
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,182
They can go out there
and use the emulator

53
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,152
and so they can begin to
find flaws in the system.

54
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,119
And when they find
a flaw in the system

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,455
and then they go implement it,

56
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,957
you simply have no
telemetry coming back.

57
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,192
You don't know it's happening.

58
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,528
And so the problem is
actually getting worse.

59
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,763
Attackers have a lot more
information than you,

60
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,032
and your information is
decreasing every single day.

61
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:49,369
So there's a lot of
challenges out there with

62
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:53,106
I think the whole ecosystem
is kind of against you.

63
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,474
And it becomes more
and more difficult

64
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,810
to respond to mobile events.

65
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,079
So I'm not gonna go through
this slide in detail.

66
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,614
If you download the deck
you can check it out.

67
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,185
But there's a lot of different
ways into mobile devices.

68
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:10,190
Baseband, browsers, system
flaws, the networks, et cetera.

69
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,325
And so we've kind
of listed them off

70
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,792
so folks can take a look at it.

71
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,895
I think Malware's a really,
really tiny piece of it,

72
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,330
it's out there.

73
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,699
But there's a whole bunch
of ways in for folks

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,001
and so as you talk about
very little information

75
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,037
and large attack surface,

76
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,773
it's an increasingly
challenging problem.

77
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,708
Now, few other
properties of mobile,

78
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,077
first of all, dual-use,
BYOD, I know it was touched

79
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,345
on at the very beginning.

80
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,013
That makes it really
hard for you guys

81
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,315
to get your hands on a phone

82
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,617
and go do the type of
analysis you need to.

83
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,321
Because as interesting
story, we had a company,

84
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,324
a fortune 500 company contact
us and their CEO's phone

85
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,725
had been compromised.

86
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,696
And they set up this agreement,
they asked us to hire

87
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,831
four people to work
over the weekend.

88
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,533
And we said, okay,
we're ramping up

89
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,801
to go respond to this thing.

90
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,335
We're like, we need
you to send the phone,

91
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,239
and we're gonna image it,
and the whole deal died.

92
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,442
And the CEO said, I'm not
gonna send anybody my phone.

93
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,310
Probably because he
was surfing something

94
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,979
and he didn't want
us to find it,

95
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,215
but the point is that this is
no longer a corporate phone

96
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,750
or a corporate device
you can go grab.

97
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,419
And people are really, really
sensitive about their devices.

98
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,155
We always, I always tell
people you are what you Google,

99
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:17,390
and the things that I've learned

100
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,890
about people doing
forensic cases.

101
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,028
So if it's a dual-use phone
it's becoming increasingly

102
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,296
difficult to get
your hands on that

103
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,298
and respect people's privacy.

104
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,066
Certainly it's always
connected, connected through

105
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,534
different types of networks.

106
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,103
You can't get admin access,

107
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,238
so you can't route the
device in most instances,

108
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,240
you can't pull out the
data that you need.

109
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,908
And there's a whole
different set of tools

110
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,044
which we'll go through
that are required

111
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,813
in order to analyze
these devices.

112
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,183
So, we're gonna kinda go
through building blocks here.

113
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,718
Now the first thing
is, is you go out there

114
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,287
and you look at all
the negatives of,

115
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,022
man there's this huge challenge,
it's increasingly growing.

116
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,958
It's this juicy
target for attackers,

117
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,028
they have a asymmetric
advantage, what can I do?

118
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,629
And I think the right
way to look at it is,

119
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,065
is well what information
can we currently extract

120
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,566
from the devices?

121
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,335
So we have this principle, we
call it the SCAN Principle.

122
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,971
And we think these
are the four areas

123
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,073
that drive risk
into mobile devices,

124
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,075
that are also things
that can be measured.

125
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:12,478
And the four areas are
system, configuration,

126
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,247
apps, and networks.

127
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,583
So, if you're able to go through
and query each one of those

128
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,953
and get security telemetry
about those four domains,

129
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:24,357
you can actually begin to
build a profile of a device.

130
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,192
One of the things
that we're recognizing

131
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,995
in a lot of enterprises is
folks are basically saying,

132
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,730
yeah, we've got mobile
devices, got BYOD,

133
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,132
got corporate owned, we've
got some MDM in place.

134
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,335
But they really don't know
what's on their network.

135
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,205
They don't know what countries
their data's being sent to.

136
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,840
They don't know what
data's being leaked out.

137
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,476
They don't know what app's
installed and what app versions.

138
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,012
And so if you have to
get started somewhere

139
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,114
one of the greatest places
is just to go out there

140
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,982
and try to identify your assets.

141
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,651
Go through that SCAN Principle.

142
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,188
Fill in the information, you
can get some of it from an MDM,

143
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,522
some of it you have
to build out apps.

144
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,291
We have a free app in
the app and play store

145
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,460
that pulls out this information.

146
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,662
But begin to collect
that information.

147
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,796
In addition to really
getting a current snapshot

148
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,100
of where your enterprise sits
and where your data's going,

149
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,368
and things of that sort,

150
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,504
it provides that kind of
crucial historical view.

151
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,805
So if somebody comes
to you and says,

152
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,474
look, my phone's acting weird.

153
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,542
You can go back and say,
well, I've got a snapshot,

154
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,277
seven snapshots, I
can see how your phone

155
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,779
has changed over time.

156
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,115
So the best place to start
is really go out there,

157
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:24,050
get an inventory of
what's happening,

158
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,918
and really following
that SCAN Principle,

159
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,988
and building up the profile
of each of the devices.

160
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,493
The tools for mobile
are different, and
so you're not gonna

161
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,594
be able to use a lot of the
same tools that you use.

162
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,196
There is a little
bit of overlap,

163
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,599
and we broke them down into
three broad categories.

164
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,435
First of all, the
continual analysis side.

165
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,239
So how can you collect data
on a near real time basis?

166
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,541
What sort of acquisition
tools exist so that you can

167
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,076
obviously acquire information

168
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,413
and then the forensics analysis
that you do after that.

169
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,747
I link out to the book,

170
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,016
there's actually an
entire chapter on this,

171
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,019
and we link to open
source and free tools.

172
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,388
So you can hit that link
and kind of build it.

173
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,856
In a half an hour talk
I'm not gonna be able

174
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,092
to go through each of those.

175
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,062
But the key here is, is that
you're gonna have to adapt

176
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:15,034
your strategy for the
challenges that mobile presents.

177
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,504
So when we first started
out back in 2009,

178
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,140
we would do physical
acquisitions of Android and IOS

179
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,542
all day long.

180
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,143
That's an option that
rarely happens today.

181
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,281
If there was a passcode, we
could typically circumvent it.

182
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,949
That rarely happens today.

183
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,784
And so you have to go out
there and basically say

184
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,587
with a limiting number
of options that we have,

185
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,854
what can we do?

186
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,624
Generally we're looking
at logical acquisitions

187
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,161
on devices that you have
access to or grabbing backups.

188
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,297
And potentially doing
some network analysis

189
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,265
to see what's happening,
what's communicating out.

190
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,669
So your acquisition choices
are becoming more limited.

191
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,339
The good news is, is that since
this isn't a law enforcement

192
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,007
case where somebody
maybe locked their phone

193
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,709
and isn't working with you.

194
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,245
Generally you can
talk to somebody and
probably gain access

195
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,780
to let's say a locked device.

196
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,052
So, what we're
gonna do today is,

197
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,855
is really kind of
talk about a playbook

198
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,756
for mobile incident response.

199
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,726
And I'd say there's
gonna be 70% overlap

200
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,228
with a traditional playbook.

201
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,730
We're gonna follow the six
steps from sans and whatnot.

202
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,634
But really taking the
experience that we've had

203
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,903
responding to actual
incidents and actual cases,

204
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,538
and saying, like
what have we learned?

205
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,607
And the way that I'll do that is

206
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll walk you through an
incident that I responded to

207
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,746
because it actually happened
to me just before RSA.

208
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,414
And I'll walk you
through what happened,

209
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,948
and how did we go about it?

210
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:41,654
And kind of tell the story of
that with my specific example.

211
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,323
Now what's really
interesting is that

212
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,760
I was talking to the CIO
of a major corporation

213
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,895
about a month or two ago.

214
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,930
And I asked him, first of all,

215
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,400
are you seeing mobile incidents
and mobile compromise?

216
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,669
And he said, oh yeah, yeah,
we see it from time to time.

217
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,307
And this company had some really
great intellectual property

218
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,144
and they were routinely
targeted by China.

219
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,780
So they had active campaigns,
they were going after their

220
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,650
phishing, they were also
going after computers.

221
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,520
And he said that they knew that
they were going after phones

222
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,757
and every time they
would go after a phone,

223
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,824
they would simply say like,
this phone's acting weird

224
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,761
well, I'm just going to
reset it, wipe it out,

225
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,996
throw it away, get a new
phone, and re-provision it.

226
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,566
And they really missed the
opportunity to go in there

227
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
and try to understand
what was happening.

228
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,538
And the reason he said, we
have no idea how to do this,

229
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,006
we just don't know what to do.

230
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,675
Like, I'd rather hit the reset
button, clean up the mess,

231
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,478
not even worry about what
happened, and move on.

232
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,979
And so my hope from
this talk would be

233
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,382
if you run into that
incident wherever you work,

234
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,184
you could say, guys,
we've got a playbook.

235
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,651
Let's try to follow this process

236
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,120
and at least learn
something from this

237
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,256
so that we can get
better at responding.

238
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,391
But that's a message that
we see all too often.

239
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,193
And I think that's something
that's gonna have to change

240
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,762
as mobile continues to
permeate every facet

241
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,198
of our business and
our personal lives.

242
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,168
Now when we think about
the types of incidents,

243
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,171
there's eight types of
incidents we think folks

244
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,306
are going to encounter.

245
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,008
We've kind of enumerated
them out here for you

246
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,509
to take a look at.

247
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,578
We're only going to focus
on one incident type today,

248
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:17,382
which is user reported, device
acting weird, or whatever.

249
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,318
But I would encourage
you guys to think through

250
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,487
each of these
types of incidents.

251
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,289
Figure out whether or
not they're applicable

252
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,490
for your organization.

253
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,192
Do some really basic
threat modeling.

254
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,927
Hey, how likely
is this to happen?

255
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,329
How easy is it, what
would be the impact to us?

256
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:35,067
And then go out there and
focus on the incident types

257
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,870
that are most likely to happen
or have the highest impact,

258
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,272
and build out a
playbook, start there.

259
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,907
And then just know that
you've got some fallback

260
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,509
mechanism to do for the
ones that you're not

261
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,777
fully prepared for yet.

262
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,847
An example would be
lost or stolen devices,

263
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,948
that happens all the time.

264
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,415
You guys already deal with that.

265
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,018
The impact is
probably pretty low,

266
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,120
there's a few things
that you can do.

267
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,956
But, malware popping
up on the app store

268
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,424
that has your
company's name in it,

269
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,160
that's a real thing that
happens, it happened to Etna.

270
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,429
Jim Roth, he's there and
has a great slide deck

271
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,731
and talks about it at
different conferences.

272
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,300
Or simply, hey, my
phone's acting weird,

273
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,069
so I need some help, and
people sending it over to you.

274
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,006
Okay, so let's jump
into the incident.

275
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,343
So this is back on February
13th, I was sitting at my house.

276
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,215
My wife and I had our
iPhones and we both kind of

277
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,552
began experiencing
this on our iPhones.

278
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,554
And you guys have all seen
this before of course.

279
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,524
It's a certificate that's
not being recognized.

280
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,127
And I'm an informed end user
so the first thing I did

281
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,330
was snap the screenshot of it.

282
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,133
My co-founder's less
technical, so she just said,

283
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,002
hey, this weird thing
came up and I hit cancel.

284
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,271
But I knew enough to say like
something's not right here.

285
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,708
So, the built in mail
program basically said

286
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,108
can't identify this.

287
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,545
The Gmail app, which
I also had installed

288
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,512
just simply wouldn't sync.

289
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,482
So as an end user I didn't
know anything was going on

290
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:57,983
when I ran the Gmail app.

291
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,953
But when I popped over to
mail, in some sense it's good

292
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,488
because mail told me
something was going on, right?

293
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,859
And in some sense
it's bad because how
many of our end users

294
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,494
would click that
continue button?

295
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,997
So, there ended up being
a certificate on here

296
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,666
and I got all the details.

297
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:19,305
Coming out from that server,
that common name there.

298
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:23,074
And I was connected to my
local wifi network at my house,

299
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,678
which was connected
to Comcast cable,

300
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,013
it was a business Comcast.

301
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:31,083
It was interesting because
also there was some DNS servers

302
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,685
that we didn't recognize.

303
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,856
So I had an invalid cert,
some weird DNS servers.

304
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,058
And so over the course
of a couple days

305
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,327
we began to dig
into this incident.

306
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,930
So, when I think about how
you identify an incident

307
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,333
I think of three primary
avenues that you ought

308
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,834
to be thinking about in mobile.

309
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,469
First of all, what are some
indicators of compromise

310
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,272
that we might want to establish?

311
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,475
If you have a baseline
for how your device acts,

312
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,144
what's normal, where
it sends its data,

313
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,546
how long it takes to
drain its battery,

314
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,014
and things of that sort.

315
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,282
Because you've been doing
that auditing process

316
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,784
and building that up.

317
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
Some of the indicators of
compromise are gonna be

318
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,788
looking at anomalies that
kind of stand out from that.

319
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,624
So we've all experienced
this where your phone

320
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,727
starts draining battery
at an enormous rate.

321
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,728
Lot of times that's an
app that's gone crazy

322
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,731
and isn't using GPS
properly or whatever.

323
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,266
But looking for those
unusual patterns,

324
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,435
but you have to
establish a base.

325
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,237
A second big area
for enterprises

326
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,372
is gonna be app
reputation monitoring.

327
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:31,744
So if you, let's say you
work for Etna or MasterCard,

328
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,079
do you know what apps
out on the app store

329
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,414
have your name in it?

330
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,649
Are they your apps?

331
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,651
Did somebody else put
a new app in there?

332
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,919
And do you know who's connecting

333
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,153
to your transactional server?

334
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,822
So if you've got a
set of IP addresses,

335
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,456
what apps are
connecting into you?

336
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,327
And so getting in to monitoring
those app in play stores

337
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,262
so that you can spot
a mobile incident,

338
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,564
where somebody's not
authorized to use your brand,

339
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,501
or they've potentially
created a malicious app.

340
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,036
And then the third category

341
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,270
and it's probably gonna
be one of the most common

342
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,972
is just simply user reported.

343
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,007
Hey my device is acting
weird, help me out.

344
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,210
And so you're gonna
have to go in there then

345
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,444
and look at the device.

346
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,079
If you don't have
any historical data

347
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,580
it's gonna be a really
big challenge for you

348
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,082
to come up with anything.

349
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,718
It's literally looking for
a needle in a needle stack.

350
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,954
And we've done tons
of those cases.

351
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,322
And you typically
walk away and say,

352
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,523
Well, I'm not really sure

353
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,924
we couldn't really
find anything.

354
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,693
So that's why that baseline
is so, so critical.

355
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,896
Now, assuming you're able to
get your hands on the device,

356
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,764
unlock it, the first thing
you're gonna want to do

357
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,399
is again, obviously
contain this.

358
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,303
So, it is possible to do some
of these things remotely.

359
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,405
So if you've got users,
you've got, let's say,

360
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,608
a continual analysis tool
on there that can kind of

361
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,108
pull out that SCAN Principle,

362
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,245
pull out those
security telemetry.

363
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,679
You're gonna go and
pull that data down

364
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,348
as soon as the user reports it.

365
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,851
In an ideal world you'll get
physical access to the device,

366
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,220
capture all of that
baseline information.

367
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,656
System, config,
apps, and networks,

368
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,724
and grab that final snapshot.

369
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,827
If it's your first
snapshot, so be it, right?

370
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,328
It's the best you can do.

371
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,764
Maybe you can compare that
phone with other phones

372
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,132
that you had in the
organization to see

373
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,165
if there's an anomaly.

374
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,069
And then one of the key
things you need to do

375
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,271
is figure out do I need to
do some network analysis

376
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,173
before I stick this
thing in to a Faraday bag

377
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,875
or stick it into airplane mode?

378
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,878
And in my particular case,
we needed to understand

379
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,314
what was the certificate,
where was the traffic going,

380
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,548
how often did it happen?

381
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,118
So we opted to keep the
device up and running

382
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,653
while we did the analysis.

383
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,389
Once you've either
done the analysis

384
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,623
or determined you
don't need to do it,

385
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,525
then you obviously want
to isolate the device,

386
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,627
and then do the
forensic acquisition.

387
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,063
If you can get a full
forensic acquisition, awesome.

388
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,465
I think your chances of
that are about 10% today

389
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,768
and it's probably
going down to about 1%.

390
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,503
So you're probably just
gonna have to grab a logical

391
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,307
or a backup, and have
your data sitting there.

392
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,843
Once you've contained
that particular device,

393
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,013
and you're gonna then go in and
do your analysis, all right?

394
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,449
So if I have a baseline,
what's changed?

395
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,419
If my data's going to a foreign
country that I haven't seen

396
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,853
in the past, what's
being sent there,

397
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,689
what app is sending it,
why is it sending it?

398
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,725
Where is the certificate,
where is the DNS server?

399
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,227
So this is gonna be
typical analysis.

400
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,863
But again, unlike a server
or desktop or laptop

401
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,598
you're just gonna have
a lot less information.

402
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:07,967
And so you're gonna
have to be able to

403
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,035
to kind of take that
limited information

404
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,471
and see if you can
extrapolate that.

405
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,340
In some instances,
maybe in a lot,

406
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,674
you're not gonna
be able to do that.

407
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,209
And so you're gonna
want to try to record

408
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,212
what the parameters were and
the baseline of that device,

409
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,247
and probably say
we're just not sure.

410
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,717
And choose basically how
you're gonna recover from it

411
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,385
and wipe it out.

412
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,619
And maybe it was nothing,

413
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,888
and maybe the user
just misunderstood.

414
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,658
But if you do spot it, then
you're gonna want to figure out

415
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,059
all right, what is it?

416
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,930
Can I identify who else
has been impacted by that,

417
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,864
can I create some
sort of signatures

418
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,401
if it's a malware
on the app store,

419
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,569
can I figure out what
users are running it?

420
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,039
Maybe you can go out
there and the user agent

421
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,175
is different when they connect
in, things of that sort.

422
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,477
And then you're gonna
obviously want to remove

423
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,613
it from that device
and wipe the device.

424
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,549
Now that typically means
you're gonna re-provision.

425
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,885
And I have a pretty
high level of confidence

426
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,521
that if you physically
reset a device

427
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,258
and restore it back to
its kind of verified image

428
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,494
from Apple or for Google, that
you're in pretty good shape.

429
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,495
If you're really concerned
about it, you could go

430
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:14,133
get a new device, I don't think
that's generally necessary.

431
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,201
But one of the amazing
things about mobile phones

432
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,270
is people walk 'em
into our network,

433
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,738
they have full access
to our network.

434
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,341
They can scan for Bluetooth,
and wifi, and networks,

435
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,943
and et cetera, and so there's
a really good opportunity

436
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,212
if somebody did target
you and did get on a phone

437
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,415
that they could move
laterally within your network.

438
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,750
Or certainly do a lot of kind
of surveillance and whatnot.

439
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,453
We did a talk at RSA
a couple years ago

440
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,955
about turning the mobile phone

441
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,058
into a corporate
espionage device.

442
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,659
And so you want to be
cognizant of the fact

443
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,227
that they could potentially
have moved laterally

444
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,229
within your network because
that phone is moving

445
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,365
in and out of all
these different places.

446
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,735
And they have some sort of
foothold on that system.

447
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,439
And the other really big
thing, and I think this is

448
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,208
a challenge in mobile is
that because mobile devices

449
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,044
combine our personal and
our corporate information

450
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,547
and they leak out an
enormous amount of data.

451
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,349
It's really amazing when
you look at two to 300 apps

452
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,784
and the aggregate of
what is on that device,

453
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,822
that the chances of an effective
social engineering attack

454
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,524
using that information
I think skyrocket.

455
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,892
And so one of the things you
want to be on the lookout for

456
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:19,298
after there's a compromise
that's been identified

457
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,935
is that how much information
does the attacker now know?

458
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,838
And could they go fake that
email to the CFO or the CEO,

459
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,639
or to the help desk, et cetera?

460
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,843
And so I would be extra cautious
about it in that instance.

461
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,646
And then the last thing
you're gonna do of course

462
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,880
is debrief, right?

463
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,016
So what happened,
what went wrong,

464
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,986
how do I need to update my
policies and procedures?

465
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,989
Did we figure out a vector
and indicate a compromise?

466
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,125
And potentially going out
there and sharing that

467
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,360
with other folks
in the industry,

468
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,295
to inoculate against
attacks in the future.

469
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,832
Generally static signatures
don't work great on mobile

470
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,868
it's very easy to
change these things

471
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,970
if you have some sort of
agent running on the phone,

472
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,972
it's running in a
sandboxed environment.

473
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,274
You can't see memory, you can't
see all these other things

474
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,243
and so you certainly
can look for it,

475
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,845
but it's not terribly effective
with a static signature.

476
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,047
And what you really
need to do is be focused

477
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,150
on anomaly detection.

478
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,486
And then ultimately try to
start correlating the data

479
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,688
and making it cross
referenceable.

480
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,458
So I'll tell you what
happened with my device

481
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,626
and what ended up happening.

482
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,395
So I was running a
Comcast business router.

483
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,865
We ended up finding out with
a Shodan search and whatnot

484
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:31,170
that there was a compromise
for that particular firmware.

485
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,774
When we first noticed the attack

486
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,244
I had gone down and ultimately
rebooted that router

487
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,180
and everything went away, so
it was a non-persistent attack.

488
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,685
And about 24 hours or so they
would re-find the IP address

489
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,287
and re-pop the router.

490
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,222
They would put in
their own DNS server.

491
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,491
That DNS server was
based out of Germany,

492
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,993
and then it redirected
traffic to another country,

493
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,495
I don't remember right now.

494
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,964
And at first it was
a little concerning

495
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,066
because we knew something
was very, very wrong

496
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,569
and it was like, hey,
are we being targeted?

497
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,705
And the end that we came
to, the end analysis

498
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,006
was we weren't being
targeted, we were just part

499
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,310
of a big net that had
been cast out there.

500
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,445
And it was attacking
these different routers.

501
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:16,748
And so the phones would
grab the new IP addresses,

502
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,017
the new certificates
would be presented,

503
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,886
and they were just trying
to get as much information

504
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,221
as they could from anybody.

505
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,590
So in the end we
ultimately isolated it down

506
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,327
to the network connection, it
wasn't specific to the device,

507
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:33,332
and we got rid of that router
and swapped in a newer one.

508
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,735
But those are the kinds of
things that you have to take

509
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,571
those user reported issues,

510
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,440
you have to dig down
into the details.

511
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,243
And it's really challenging
if you think about,

512
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,178
could you get one of
your employees to capture

513
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,616
the right information
to then work with you

514
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,585
at their home router
to figure out that

515
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,055
it wasn't your device, or it
was your device, et cetera?

516
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,490
And it's a really
challenging thing because

517
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,158
mobile's so distributed.

518
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,328
So I think it's gonna be
a couple interesting years

519
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,297
for mobile incident response.

520
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,065
Today the tools aren't
really out there.

521
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,835
I started hacking together
a tool that would allow you

522
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,404
to quickly triage IOS devices

523
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,506
and then ultimately
Android devices.

524
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,608
And so I think what you're
gonna see is that a lot

525
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,409
of the folks that had
been building tools

526
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,079
for digital forensics are
going to find that mobile

527
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,447
is interesting, it's where
we've been for about seven years

528
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,450
and it's a really
fascinating space.

529
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,220
And you'll start to see
tools start to get built.

530
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,921
You're going to have
less and less data.

531
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,592
It's more and more challenging
to do these investigations,

532
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:37,529
but it's becoming a real
reality for all enterprises.

533
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,766
So we might be
out of time, but--

534
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,733
- [Man] No, you got time.

535
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,168
- Okay, so we're good on time?

536
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,136
- [Man] Sure.

537
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,270
- Anybody have any questions?

538
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,541
- [Man] Okay, I'll actually
go and kick it off here

539
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,677
as we move a mic over
to this gentleman here.

540
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,713
What do you think about
the IOS source code

541
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,383
to the colonel being
released un-obfuscated?

542
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,553
- Right, so I know that
Apple responded and said

543
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,055
that it was intentional.

544
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,824
And they have a pretty tight
ship there that they run.

545
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,993
It certainly didn't feel
terribly intentional,

546
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,998
but I think it's probably a
good thing for the industry.

547
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,870
Apple patches about 100
vulnerabilities per IOS release.

548
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,972
You can go out there and
read their security page.

549
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,709
So today all of us feel
like, great, I'm on a phone

550
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,278
that the FBI can't break
into and everything's good.

551
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,648
If you look at the release
notes, I think it was 932,

552
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,384
there's about 100 security
flaws, and 10 of 'em

553
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,786
had a CVSS score of over nine.

554
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,489
And all of those
were colonel level.

555
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,225
So, in the end I think
it's a really good thing

556
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,829
because I think it's
a closed ecosystem

557
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,732
and you need more eyeballs
on what's happening,

558
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,466
and certainly Apple
has a lot of problems

559
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,603
whether it's the go-to fail,
through all of the different

560
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:55,273
things that you can see out
there in the CVs databases.

561
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,774
- [Man] Thanks.

562
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:59,644
- [Citizen] Do you have any
recommendations for good

563
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,948
mobile security packages that
you could load on your phone?

564
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,716
- So, I'm biased on that.

565
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,520
So I'll preface that yes,
so we've built an app

566
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,888
it's a very challenging
thing to do,

567
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,656
it's called NowSecure Protect.

568
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,158
And it tries to take
those four domains

569
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,097
and collect information about
the health of an end point.

570
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,134
And so there's two things that
you need to do to protect,

571
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,869
to operate with
confidence in mobile,

572
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,536
you need to have a secure app,

573
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,239
running on a healthy end point.

574
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,008
If your app withstands
a wifi attack,

575
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,510
and withstands a
forensics attack

576
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,412
because you don't store
anything sensitive.

577
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:37,516
And then you're operating on a
device that's not jail broken

578
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,485
that is on a good wifi
network, et cetera.

579
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,554
You can operate with confidence,
in fact I'm gonna argue

580
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,923
you can operate with
more confidence than you

581
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,758
would on a windows box.

582
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,261
But you need those two
key pieces of information.

583
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,196
So get a secure
app and make sure

584
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,630
it's got a healthy end point.

585
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,833
And our belief is you
measure that SCAN Principle,

586
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,067
those four domains.

587
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,636
There's probably
other tools out there,

588
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:00,205
but tools that back all your
traffic, burn your battery,

589
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,808
invade your privacy,
ultimately those will fail,

590
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,844
because mobile's going to
resist that, it defies that.

591
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,747
Yes sir.

592
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,515
- [Man] Is there a universe
in which you'd recommend

593
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,384
that an enterprise if
they provide phones

594
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,387
would have, you'd recommend
that they would have

595
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,355
some type of jail break
on them to do analysis?

596
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,291
Or does that just
make them much more,

597
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,159
or much less secure that
it totally is ineffective?

598
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,396
- Yeah, I don't see
that ever happening.

599
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,798
I mean, so part of me
as security researcher,

600
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,634
sure I love it and I think in
the hands of the right person

601
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,637
a jail broken, or probably
rooted Android phone

602
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,339
would be the route
that I would go,

603
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,975
can provide a much
higher level of security.

604
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,843
It doesn't scale.

605
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,979
Administrators at large
enterprises don't understand it.

606
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,183
Users could potentially make
mistakes and open up things.

607
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:49,321
And so, I think that the core
security of both platforms

608
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:54,326
is increasing, I think that
Apple is outpacing Android.

609
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,928
So either you have two choices,

610
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,931
it's an iPhone or an Android
phone running Google's

611
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,434
version of, that gets
the monthly patches.

612
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:07,272
But I suspect that jail breaking
is not tenable at scale,

613
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:09,241
and I don't see
enterprise going there.

614
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,109
- [Man] Would there,
I have no idea,

615
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,310
but I would imagine
there was some kind

616
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,080
of legal repercussion
for an enterprise

617
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,716
to actively try and jail break
or root an iPhone at least

618
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,353
because I'd imagine
they're protected somewhat.

619
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,455
- So Apple is going
to fight them on it,

620
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,990
and we have some customers
who don't want us

621
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,125
to test their mobile apps
on a jail broken iPhone

622
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,095
because they believe it
violates Apple's EULA.

623
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,030
So I would say absolutely
that's a challenge.

624
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,032
And I think the bigger thing
that's at play here is,

625
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,501
is that because these
are dual-use devices

626
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,904
and people are increasingly
aware of their privacy,

627
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,807
and where was I last
night at 2:00 a.m.,

628
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,809
and does my company
need to know that?

629
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,013
And actually more importantly
from the enterprises' side,

630
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,515
it's a liability for them to
know where you were last night.

631
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,652
It now becomes a
subpoena-able event.

632
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,820
And so what we're finding
is the largest enterprises

633
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,889
are coming to us and
saying, you know what,

634
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,257
give me a score on how
healthy the end point is

635
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,627
and I don't want any
other data about it.

636
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,963
And so I think that's
really the trend that we're

637
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,665
gonna see in the industry.

638
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,235
- [Man] And sorry, before
we close I know the crusades

639
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,437
were fought over last, but
from an incident response

640
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,072
standpoint, if I'm rolling
out a devices today,

641
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,342
Apple, Android,
what do you think?

642
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,812
- I think your two choices
are Apple with the latest IOS,

643
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:25,817
or a Nexus device with
the monthly patch updates.

644
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:27,985
- [Man] Okay, there
you have it folks.

645
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,220
Andrew Hoog, thank you so much,

646
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,255
- Appreciate it.
- Give it up folks.

647
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,089
- [Andrew] Thank you.

648
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,358
(applause)

649
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,765
(increasingly loud tone)
