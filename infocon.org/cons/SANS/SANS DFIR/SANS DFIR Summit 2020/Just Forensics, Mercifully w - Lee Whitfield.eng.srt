11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
different to most of the talks you're

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,440

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,360

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,159
um so just a little bit about me

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,680
um i um i work for sands full-time

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,880

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,240
company

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,320

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,320
have called 337 forensics

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,360
then in addition to that um i also

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,720
used to run a podcast

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,399
webcast called forensic forecast and

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,039
as a as a part of that um

38
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
forensic forecast uh spawned the

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,360
forensic forecast awards which we're

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
tomorrow at 4 15. um so i'm going to

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,119
plug this

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,039
as much as i can this is the because

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
we're doing everything live online this

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
year i don't have to have the awards

46
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,399
already

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,200
engraved and everything so we can in

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,840
fact

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,598
run the voting all the way up until the

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,200
time that the winners are announced

51
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,519
and so because of that i'm just going to

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,238
stick a link into

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
my little hallway here um feel free to

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,360
go on

55
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,879
look at the different nominees there and

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
and make votes

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,920
um my head has been reminding everyone

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,160
anyway

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
so

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
let's talk about what i want to talk

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,319
about today then

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,359
now there's

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,599
uh like i said i've got a bit of a

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,599
a reputation at sends sometimes

65
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,000
um i will come out and i'll do highly

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,359
technical types of talks sometimes i'll

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,599
come out and i'll talk about

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
different cases i've worked on and then

69
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,518
occasionally

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
i'll take a topic or come up with a

71
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,599
topic

72
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,959
that isn't either um

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,319
that is probably a little bit

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,800
uh more of a delicate type of topic um

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,480
the last one that i did was about uh how

76
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,519
forensic investigators

77
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,238
deal with um with the effects of

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
looking at child pornography every day

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
um

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
this one not gonna be quite as extreme

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,640
as that um this is all safe

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,040
for work content right here um

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,798
but what i do want to preface this with

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,079
is by saying that

85
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,560
um i came up with this talk months ago

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
okay now some people might think well

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,200
you're just pandering because of all the

88
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
events of the last

89
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,480
uh few months and everything else i'm

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
not i promise this was all put together

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
ages ago and when i saw that matt was

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
speaking this morning on what his topic

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,720
was

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,040
i got a little bit nervous thinking that

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,280
he was going to steal some of my thunder

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
so thankfully though his talk was

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
wonderful and it goes

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,239
right along with what i'm going to talk

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,399
about today

100
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,040
um there is some crossover with with

101
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
what matt said and there is also some

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,720
further crossover

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
with what we have seen developing in the

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,359
news the last couple of months with the

105
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,120
protests and

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
racial equality movements and things

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,959
like that um

108
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
but like i said not based on that this

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,160
was all

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,680
thought of completely separately

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,680
so the first thing i want to talk about

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,759
um just to put some background to this

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,440
and if you can cast your mind back to

114
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,280
january of this year

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,719
now it seems like it's only a few months

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
ago but really it was like seven or

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,840
eight years ago in real

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
in real time based on everyone's

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,359
experiences since then

120
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,198
but um back in january back when the

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
world was in a normal state

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,720
uh my wife and i decided we're going to

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
have a date and we would go out to see a

124
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
movie

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,360
and didn't know much about the movie

126
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,400
that we're going to go and see except

127
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,639
that it had michael b

128
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,479
jordan in it and i really like michael b

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
jordan i think all the movies that he's

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
done

131
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,638
have been pretty what have been pretty

132
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
good uh with the exception of that

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,120
fantastic four atrocity um but

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,680
you know all those others have been

135
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,280
pretty good so

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,320
i this movie was called just mercy

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
now i'm an avid movie goer and so i

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,280
don't really need much of an excuse to

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,080
go and see a movie

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,880
um but seldom do i come away from a

141
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,080
movie

142
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,280
with such a desire

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,479
to do something so

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,159
this movie did just that and if you

145
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,719
haven't seen it you know i

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
please um it's it's available online now

147
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
go watch it i even had it for free for

148
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,440
the whole month of june

149
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,120
um the movie is based on the true story

150
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
and the the premise of this

151
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
is that this african-american man back

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,799
in the 90s

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,880
was um arrested uh

154
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,919
charged and prosecuted for the death of

155
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,120
a caucasian

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,758
woman in a small town um

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,319
there was actually very little evidence

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,240
that

159
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
he had anything to do with this and

160
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
really no evidence

161
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,440
um but due to his skin color and his

162
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,639
social class

163
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,280
um he was afforded very little in terms

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:18,639
of uh support leniency or even justice

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,520
um he his trial is over very quickly

166
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,840
he's found guilty and sentenced to death

167
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,758
by electric chair

168
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,799
now an attorney named brian stevenson

169
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,479
um played by jordan um tries to get the

170
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
decision reversed

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,880
pointing out this severe lack of

172
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,639
evidence all the racist actions taken by

173
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,159
the police officers involved

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,080
and dishonesty and and so forth

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
um because the attorney himself is

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,479
african-american

177
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,039
he also ends up being on the receiving

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
end of

179
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,199
some threats and harassment and his

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
investigation

181
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,720
seems to hit roadblocks at every single

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,520
turn

183
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
um even after a key witness recants his

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
testimony

185
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,639
really the key witness um the court

186
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,758
still refuses to reverse their decision

187
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,599
which was mind-blowing to me um

188
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,319
eventually they rallied the media

189
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:19,759
and they get um they get a retrial and

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,560
the man is exonerated which is wonderful

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
now as the lights came on in the movie

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,599
theater

193
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,120
um i just kind of sat there thinking and

194
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,159
i turned to my wife

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,639
um alicia and

196
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,160
i just i was like i want to do something

197
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,800
this is important right um

198
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,880
this guy had done nothing wrong but he

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
still ended up in prison on death row no

200
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
less

201
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,520
for years uh his previous

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
attorneys had not been very good uh been

203
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,680
stayed appointed

204
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,758
and um they i think believe one of them

205
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,520
got disbarred sometime later on

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,120
and they just didn't really care it was

207
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,318
another guy going through the system

208
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
right

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,720
um he was too poor to afford his own

210
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
attorneys

211
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,879
if if brian stevenson hadn't come in

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,360
with his charitable work

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
this guy would have been put to death

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,400
there's no question

215
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,400
so here's the thing though as we sat

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
there after watching this movie

217
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,599
um i turned to our wife and we're

218
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
talking and

219
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
i we talked about the feelings that we

220
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
were having at that point

221
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
and i said i i have to do something i i

222
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,039
can't

223
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,519
believe that there's a um

224
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,240
you know this kind of stuff can happen

225
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
um

226
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
so i would you know and i felt quite

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,680
passionate about it

228
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
but the thing is is that it's all right

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
to have those kinds of feelings

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
the problem is though is that

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,560
as we walk away from seeing a movie or

232
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,800
reading a book or whatever else

233
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,719
um life just gets in the way we get busy

234
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
with work we get busy with family

235
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
we have other things that we want to do

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
and eventually

237
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,000
those feelings of um

238
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,240
of of wanting to do something all kind

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,200
of get pushed to the side

240
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,480
and slowly that they're forgotten but i

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,279
was pretty determined

242
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
um i i know that i felt this way before

243
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
about things and just let things wane

244
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
and just disappear i did not want that

245
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,480
to be the case this time

246
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,399
so um i decided to go and do

247
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,399
something about it so

248
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,800
i've got to ask the question of you for

249
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,239
you to think for yourself okay

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,839
um now understanding that none of the

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,440
cases in brian's book

252
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
or the movie were anything to do with

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,160
digital forensics okay

254
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,680
what happens when we see

255
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,719
some kind of struggle or injustice

256
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,920
that does intersect with our own chosen

257
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
field

258
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,360
whose responsibility is it to stand up

259
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:09,279
and help do we just turn a blind eye

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,279
and wait for someone else to do it

261
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,839
well a couple of things i want to

262
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
just talk about in terms of what has

263
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,160
happened

264
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
in our field okay the first one is quite

265
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
a well

266
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,839
known um case at least it is for those

267
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,640
who have been in the field for a while

268
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,839
now

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
um for those younger practitioners um

270
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,279
you might not recognize them they

271
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,000
recognize the name of julia marrow

272
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
but before you millennials start saying

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
okay boomer

274
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,680
um let me assure you this is that there

275
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,199
is a lot to learn

276
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,279
from this case okay um this all starts

277
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,680
back in 2004

278
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:56,880
where julia mero substitute teacher um

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,880
living in um

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,760
oh i lost the state for a second anyway

281
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,600
on the east coast in in the states um

282
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,439
she was a substitute teacher

283
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
comes comes into a classroom one day

284
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
there is a computer

285
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,920
at connecticut sorry got it um

286
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,239
there was a computer at the front of the

287
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,079
room running windows 98

288
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
there is a projector obviously

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,880
projecting onto the wall behind her

290
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
so all the students in the class can see

291
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,000
and she's doing something on the

292
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,360
computer when she's suddenly hit

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,240
with a pop-up pawn storm okay

294
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,079
and she panics she's like clicking on

295
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
x's all over the place as she does so

296
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,439
more things pop up on the screen and

297
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
it's just

298
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
a disaster for her she's panicked she

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
runs out of the classroom to find

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,760
another teacher

301
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,439
brings the other teacher in they're both

302
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
trying to fix this without any luck and

303
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,200
eventually just pull

304
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,000
the power from the back of the computer

305
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
all the kids are

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,800
laughing about it obviously you know

307
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:02,000
being typical teenagers

308
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,000
but problem solved everything's fine

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
later on police officers show up to

310
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,480
julie's home

311
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,479
and arrest her and on charges of child

312
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,839
endangerment

313
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,200
um and she's taken she's locked up and

314
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,720
she's put on trial now

315
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
a forensic investigator for the

316
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
prosecution and

317
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,439
really they should i should say forensic

318
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,560
investigator for the prosecution

319
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,000
looks at the computer and

320
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,079
sees um some stuff going on

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,519
and makes this horrible horrible

322
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,239
conclusion

323
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
he is looking at the raw html for the

324
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,480
page

325
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,680
which caused the pop-up storm

326
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,279
and he sees that the link is encoded as

327
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,279
red now

328
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
back in the earlier days of the internet

329
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,560
and http

330
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,720
blue was a link you had not clicked on

331
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
red was a link you had clicked on but

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,560
that was all within the browser that

333
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,880
wasn't hard coded into the web page

334
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,719
but he said that because that link was

335
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,399
read she clicked on it

336
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
she was responsible for creating that

337
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,440
pop-up storm which endangered the

338
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
children

339
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:20,079
as a result julie was

340
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,880
convicted and um

341
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
this is three years later in 2007 um she

342
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
was convicted

343
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,480
and um she faced

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,399
potential maximum prison time of 40

345
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,839
years

346
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,200
now that's seems astronomical in and of

347
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,320
itself

348
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
but this is the problem right is that

349
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,639
she did not have

350
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,760
um a lot of money her and her husband

351
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
both um

352
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,880
you know she was a substitute teacher

353
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
husband um

354
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,760
what it was that he did for work but

355
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,240
they they weren't wealthy by any means

356
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,000
so they couldn't afford their own uh own

357
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,959
attorneys and whatever else i think

358
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
someone took it

359
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,319
on pro bono um they

360
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
didn't or couldn't afford forensic

361
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
investigators

362
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,600
to look at the computer themselves

363
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,399
and there was just a lot of problems

364
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,839
with that you know

365
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,320
and so the jury relied wholly on

366
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,639
the testimony of this one forensic

367
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,920
investigator

368
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,199
well a few months later

369
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,240
um a judge overturned

370
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,599
that conviction he said look there

371
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,920
there's

372
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
there's something not right about this

373
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,719
we need to revisit this

374
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,360
and figure out a better way

375
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,639
so um the attorneys went away and they

376
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,320
talked about it

377
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,320
and then the next year 2008 now

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,240
over four years since the original

379
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,120
incident took place four years of hell

380
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,880
for

381
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
um julian her husband um

382
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,000
she decided enough was enough and she

383
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
pled guilty to

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,440
a disorderly conduct charge now because

385
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
of that

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
she had her teaching uh credentials

387
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,800
revoked she's not allowed to

388
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,720
to teach anymore um and

389
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,479
in discussions i've had with other

390
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
people i've learned that you know julie

391
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
still suffers from

392
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
medical issues relating to stress from

393
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,160
these four years

394
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,839
um and all kinds of long-term effects

395
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,240
which will be there for the rest of her

396
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,519
life

397
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,560
so it's one of this is one of these

398
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,480
cases that's

399
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,040
just so important uh in terms of

400
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,839
like what do you do do you stand on the

401
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,319
sidelines

402
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
or do you get involved now what i can

403
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,079
say is that there were a team of

404
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,160
forensics

405
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
experts that got involved in this and

406
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,519
did actually help to submit

407
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,880
a report to the courtroom so that

408
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:57,040
did help a lot in that particular regard

409
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
oops jumped too far

410
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
okay the next one i want to talk to you

411
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
about

412
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,199
um this is a really interesting one this

413
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,599
one i had personal knowledge of too

414
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:14,880
um now this um

415
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:19,440
when i worked in the uk i did a

416
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,360
lot of um criminal prosecution work

417
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,639
a lot of places in the uk contracted to

418
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,519
different police forces around the

419
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,279
country

420
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,240
and we had this one case come in um

421
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,720
in which there was some kind of ebay

422
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,560
slash

423
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:40,160
paypal fraud going on and

424
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,119
what had happened uh is that

425
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
the police had some uh sorry paypal had

426
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,759
submitted

427
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,199
some report and the police were

428
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,800
following up uh on

429
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,519
that four on a fraudulent um

430
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,000
on the fraudulent evidence i guess and

431
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,519
so

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
what happened was that um this man

433
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,639
and his family were just sitting around

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
at home

435
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,079
one evening whenever there was a really

436
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,799
loud knock on the door

437
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,678
like a pounding so they get up and

438
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,879
answer the door

439
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,880
and in swarms this huge group of police

440
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,000
officers

441
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,480
and um they immediately

442
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,640
um ask questions about where are the

443
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,240
computers and the phones in the house

444
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,559
we need to take them and so

445
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
uh they put the put the the father in

446
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,200
handcuffs

447
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,879
they walk him outside and put him in the

448
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
back of a police car

449
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,799
all these other police officers walking

450
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
in and out of the home carrying like

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,320
computers and whatever else and you know

452
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
all the neighbors are seeing all of this

453
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,760
happen and you know

454
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,679
i mean obviously the first thought going

455
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
through their heads was oh no that poor

456
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,520
man

457
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,559
no it was probably something um

458
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,840
very very different right um

459
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
if you saw something like that happening

460
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,199
to one of your neighbors where's your

461
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
mind gonna go

462
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
so the rumor mill was in full motion

463
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,799
um suggesting that he had been peddling

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,520
images of children and and so on

465
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,200
his family were ostracized and uh

466
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,039
bullied and all kinds of stuff as a

467
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,679
result of this

468
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,039
and the man was told by his employer

469
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,240
don't come back

470
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,280
you're done here okay now

471
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,640
the real story however is a little bit

472
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,480
different um

473
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,520
the the account used to do this

474
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
defrauding was something along the lines

475
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,879
of

476
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,280
um john smith at

477
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,280
hotmail.com um

478
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,520
and so whenever somebody had submitted

479
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,879
that report unfortunately they fat

480
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,400
fingered something and they did john s

481
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,720
smith at hotmail.com

482
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
and this gentleman owned the second

483
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,320
email address that had nothing to do

484
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,000
with this

485
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,520
so um the police acted on

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,640
poor information um the guy

487
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,080
was um arrested and

488
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,320
i think that this was about five months

489
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
after the arrest is when the computers

490
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,280
came to us

491
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,719
to do the investigation whenever we

492
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,000
found out they got the email address

493
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,679
wrong we tried to reach out to the

494
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,320
police officer in charge

495
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,000
and like oh no he's on vacation um he

496
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,320
can deal with it when we get back

497
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
well is there anyone else who can auth

498
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
who's authorized to look at this

499
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
they're like no we'd have to wait for

500
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,039
him like that poor guy

501
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,400
i mean really it just

502
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,840
it just seemed the whole thing just

503
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,840
seemed crazy to me

504
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,320
then the final

505
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,000
example i want to talk to you about and

506
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,760
this one probably

507
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,679
is the closest to what i want to talk

508
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,879
about

509
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,480
so last year there was a man

510
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,080
living in new york um he had lived with

511
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,640
his ex-girlfriend

512
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,039
well his girlfriend at the time i guess

513
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,000
uh they had since split up

514
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,440
um but they shared an apartment and they

515
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,320
had a court date

516
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
to go and

517
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,760
to go and figure out who was going to

518
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,480
keep living in that apartment

519
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,280
now the woman came to the police one

520
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
morning

521
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
and said um just before six o'clock this

522
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
morning

523
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,799
um my ex came up to me he threatened me

524
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,559
he beat me and he told me effectively

525
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,799
not to show up to the court hearing

526
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,720
so the police went away and they

527
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,158
arrested him

528
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,559
um he was charged and he was like

529
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,600
i had nothing to do with this i i was on

530
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,158
my way to work

531
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,959
across town whenever this happened i

532
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,480
honestly

533
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,400
this could not have been me um

534
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,240
but the problem was is that he actually

535
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,640
had no evidence to prove

536
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,960
it his innocence now that in and of

537
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,799
itself is an interesting concept

538
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,400
uh but we'll have to debate a debate

539
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,480
another time

540
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,520
um now the man

541
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,799
because again didn't have a lot of money

542
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,360
um he was uh appointed um a public

543
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,320
defender in new york

544
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,600
and um the public defender was actually

545
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,480
quite savvy he

546
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,320
he said do you have a smartphone man

547
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:36,000
said yes i do and he handed it over

548
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,120
now in new york the public defenders

549
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
well it's not the public defender's

550
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,959
office there there is a legal aid office

551
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,480
in new york which is invested

552
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,919
um over a hundred thousand dollars

553
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,640
in setting up a lab for uh public

554
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,880
defenders

555
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,280
and their clients to use where they

556
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,840
bring in things like cell bright x-rays

557
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,200
and you know magnet forensics all that

558
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,399
kind of stuff and

559
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,400
in this particular instance um they were

560
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,840
able to take the guy's phone

561
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,919
go to go into this office have a

562
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,158
forensic investigator look at it

563
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,360
and they were able to take off his

564
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,640
device

565
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,080
all kinds of location data from the

566
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
morning of the incident

567
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,480
which showed him being on a train

568
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,520
heading in the opposite direction so he

569
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,799
was exonerated

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,879
case was dismissed now

571
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,559
that's a that's a good ending to the

572
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,480
story but the problem

573
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:37,840
that we have is still

574
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,720
pretty much the same men can't afford

575
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,399
attorney

576
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,720
if you can't afford attorney he can't

577
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,720
afford a forensic investigator

578
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,240
if this happened anywhere other than new

579
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,840
york

580
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,080
this guy may have gone to prison for

581
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,360
this

582
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,080
which is staggering to me okay so

583
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,320
let's say this happens in a small town

584
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,439
out here in texas somewhere

585
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,918
who sticks up for this guy um who goes

586
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,039
out

587
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,679
and says look i can help you i want to

588
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,720
help you what can i do

589
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:16,240
um and if no one does

590
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,480
he gets potentially he gets locked up

591
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,200
so unfortunately

592
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
this happens fairly frequently now there

593
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,159
are

594
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,918
other things around which like there are

595
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,840
instances where the court will approve

596
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
to you to spend a certain budget to hire

597
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
a forensic investigator or stuff like

598
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
that

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,039
but those those instances aren't

600
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,799
frequent um and so it leaves

601
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,400
this gap and a gap which frankly

602
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:49,760
people aren't willing to fill right now

603
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,000
so these examples from our own

604
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,879
field hopefully they give you some

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
indication

606
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,240
of why these things are important but

607
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,440
how do they make

608
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,440
you feel um do you feel frustrated

609
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,840
do you feel angry um do you feel even

610
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
maybe a little bit ashamed

611
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,199
all of these are perfectly legitimate

612
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,080
feelings to have and

613
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
i can tell you that i expect i've

614
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,399
experienced the same things

615
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,400
i've gone through them myself

616
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
so

617
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
sorry

618
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,440
now as i said before when talking about

619
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,559
the movie

620
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,520
okay it is really easy to let these

621
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,559
kinds of

622
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,760
feelings um swell around in our minds

623
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,000
for a couple of days

624
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
and then let something else take over

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
and something will occupy our minds

626
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,880
and we'll inevitably forget about it and

627
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,240
focus our attention elsewhere

628
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,279
but i mean it doesn't fix the problem so

629
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,400
i'm gonna implore you today

630
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:01,840
don't go away from here without

631
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,840
some kind of plan to change it okay

632
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
none of us have got this far in our

633
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,240
careers on our own

634
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,279
um as the saying goes no man is an

635
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,760
island

636
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,039
and this field continues to grow and

637
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,960
evolve

638
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,480
over our learning and comprehension all

639
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,360
the tools everything

640
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,400
we rely on other people in a lot of

641
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,600
cases to do

642
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,799
work that we benefit from

643
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,760
um but because of that we also have

644
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,039
the knowledge and the tools to benefit

645
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,158
others

646
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:38,080
so go back to that julie amero case

647
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,559
her life um was irreparably

648
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,720
turned upside down because she was

649
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,918
unable to afford her own forensics

650
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,760
expert

651
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,559
um i mean her life was just altered in

652
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,840
ways that she'll never

653
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,760
never recover from and uh

654
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,279
this guy in this last example in new

655
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,240
york

656
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,720
if if he hadn't happened to live in new

657
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
york

658
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,520
and uh be able to make use of the lab

659
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,679
that was there for the legal aid

660
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,799
um he potentially could have gone to

661
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,480
prison and

662
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,360
um you know been recorded as a dangerous

663
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,600
criminal for the rest of his life

664
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,479
now the innocence project um

665
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,199
here in the states uh believes that as

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,480
many

667
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,080
as one percent of prisoners

668
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:31,200
in the us are actually innocent now

669
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,480
one percent might not sound like many

670
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
people

671
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,200
but one percent of the population

672
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:43,439
of the prison population in the u.s is

673
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,320
20 000 people okay in other words

674
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,799
the average size of a town in the united

675
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,320
states

676
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,840
okay a whole town could be innocent

677
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,879
and imprisoned okay so

678
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:01,600
what does that mean for us

679
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,559
well going back to us for a second

680
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,760
many of us in the field are extremely

681
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,960
fortunate okay

682
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,919
we work in a great area with amazing

683
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,520
people

684
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,559
um and we do

685
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,520
um a lot of good and there's a lot

686
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,559
a lot of opportunity for us to grow and

687
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,039
improve

688
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,399
now we're also fortunate to be paid

689
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,120
pretty well

690
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,120
and in some cases really well so

691
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,199
we we've been afforded plenty of

692
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,240
opportunity

693
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,480
ourselves and we are

694
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:45,120
probably the grateful recipients of

695
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:48,480
many of life's benefits um

696
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,360
more than that um we work in a field

697
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,240
uh where when the world is in turmoil as

698
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,240
we've seen the last

699
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
few months instead of us seeing a

700
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,720
slowdown

701
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,399
we see a massive increase in work

702
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:06,320
which means job security how many fields

703
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:09,199
in the world can the world go to hell

704
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,000
and yet we're still like all happy

705
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
because

706
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,200
we're still able to work every day um

707
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,479
not many we are in a very very good

708
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,760
position

709
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,200
now i myself i know i've benefited a lot

710
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,120
from working in this field

711
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,039
and i've been able to raise a family buy

712
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,678
a home in a nice neighborhood

713
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,879
i've been able to travel to exotic

714
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,200
places like

715
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,919
edinburgh paris um london athens

716
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,720
vienna dublin um and then soon i'll

717
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,200
visit places

718
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,840
outside of texas too uh so

719
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,039
if if i've been so blessed in my own

720
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,639
life

721
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,279
how can i now just sit back and just do

722
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
nothing

723
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,279
when other people are in need why not

724
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,960
use some of my own resources and

725
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,039
knowledge

726
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
to ensure that situations like we've

727
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,320
talked about up to now

728
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,320
are either reduced or eliminated

729
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,960
completely

730
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,720
well most companies you work for

731
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,320
will have some policy in place for

732
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,440
charitable work

733
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,080
ask about it okay um there will likely

734
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,720
be limits on what you're allowed to do

735
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,240
um but doing something is better than

736
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
doing nothing i'm sure everyone will

737
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
agree on that

738
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,080
now don't go away from here with this

739
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,440
feeling of righteous indignation

740
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,678
and then let it pass like we've already

741
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,799
talked about let it motivate you to do

742
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,679
something good now that being said

743
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,600
you may want to get involved but have no

744
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,760
idea as to how

745
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,320
so i'm going to just help you out with a

746
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,080
few suggestions here

747
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,240
first of all you need to educate

748
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,120
yourself on the issues now i don't mean

749
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,039
via the media i mean real world

750
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,199
experiences

751
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,799
talk to criminal criminal defense

752
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,840
attorneys

753
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,960
talk to public defenders ask them

754
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,158
what they need and how you can help

755
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,360
many of the clients they can't afford

756
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,480
their own attorneys

757
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,719
much less a forensic expert so

758
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,399
see what they need and then go from

759
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,600
there

760
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,158
second you might want to pledge to do x

761
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,600
number of

762
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,279
hours of pro bono work every year

763
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,120
now this will of course depend on your

764
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,559
own circumstances

765
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,399
but allocate something uh as the saying

766
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,158
goes a journey of a thousand miles

767
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,158
begins with a single step

768
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,760
now next thing

769
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,039
as soon as i finished reading this just

770
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,279
mercy book

771
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,480
i actually reached out directly to brian

772
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,240
stevenson

773
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,399
um he runs an organization called the

774
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,120
equal justice initiative

775
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,840
and uh the the organization's mission is

776
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,279
to

777
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,039
uh end mass incarceration and excessive

778
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,760
punishment in the united states

779
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,279
to child to challenging racial and

780
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,158
economic injustice

781
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,840
and to protecting basic human rights for

782
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,679
the most vulnerable people in american

783
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,039
society

784
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,640
so when i reached out to him i explained

785
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,279
that you know i saw the movie i read the

786
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,279
book

787
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,320
this is what i do for work this is what

788
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,760
i'm good at

789
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,320
um i want to help please tell me

790
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,519
how i can help you and your organization

791
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,720
to do that

792
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,960
now um and i said you know

793
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,320
i will do all of this at no charge for

794
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,559
you also

795
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,000
now i realize that not everyone's in a

796
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,639
position to do that

797
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,440
but again start somewhere and offer

798
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,240
something

799
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,519
now you don't have to go out and hit up

800
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,960
um eji

801
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,320
uh directly yourselves but you can look

802
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,080
more locally so

803
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,720
just just looking within 20 miles of my

804
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,158
own home i found many different

805
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,799
organizations

806
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,600
and places where i can volunteer my time

807
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,960
now your mileage is going to vary here

808
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,158
um what do i mean by that well

809
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,640
i understand that that some of these

810
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,600
causes

811
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,880
uh or some of these organizations may

812
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,799
make you think

813
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,559
uh i don't know if i necessarily feel

814
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,960
comfortable helping

815
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,039
with this organization or this

816
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,679
organization or this organization

817
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,879
and you know what that's fine that is

818
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,640
perfectly normal

819
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,000
and no one should ever feel pressured to

820
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,960
align themselves

821
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
with an organization that doesn't share

822
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,720
their

823
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,840
own values so i've sat with

824
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,399
forensicators

825
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,918
from all over the world and they all

826
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,439
have their own experiences their own

827
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,840
backgrounds and they've formed their own

828
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,080
opinions and ideas

829
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,519
they've even been disagreements and

830
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,559
differences of opinion

831
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,519
um but we're able to all work

832
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,200
through them and work together there is

833
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,840
no one-size-fits-all

834
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,399
for this type of work you will need to

835
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,360
put in

836
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,959
the research yourself look at which

837
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,559
organizations

838
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,840
um may share the same

839
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,120
beliefs and core values as yourself or

840
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,799
your business

841
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,479
um and then make contact

842
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:32,000
ask them how you can help um i guarantee

843
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,960
that they all do need this help and so

844
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,120
it's

845
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:41,279
it's you will have no

846
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,279
lack of opportunity to offer service

847
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,559
so how else besides that how else can

848
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,600
you get involved on a community level

849
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,399
well a few more suggestions here

850
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,918

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,280
of forensic investigators come up and

875
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,639

876
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,520

877
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,560
all again

878
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,400
local dish local school districts um

879
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,839
could always do with some help with

880
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,920
someone coming in and teaching the

881
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,279
students about cyber crime

882
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,000
um or you know how to stay safe online

883
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,839
things of that nature all right and i

884
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,800
realize that i'm really pushing time

885
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,839
here

886
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,359
so one last thing

887
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,400
michael hoffman sands instructor um

888
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,440
he partnered with trace labs recently

889
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,640
to um to put an open source intelligence

890
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,280
search party

891
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,040
capture the flag in this event

892
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,240
participants were asked to find

893
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,960
real world missing persons uh

894
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,799
as part of the ctf using their

895
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,040
intelligence gathering skills

896
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,839
and it was a huge success and a lot of

897
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,279
good was done

898
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,040
as a result lots of areas of

899
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,160
investigation uh opened

900
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,160
to the police um

901
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,040
so now you'd have to wait for a ctf to

902
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,920
be hosted you can go straight to

903
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,680
tracelabs.org

904
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,040
sign up and start working on things

905
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,640
right away

906
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,640
so that

907
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,399
there you go that's about it so

908
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,839
like i said not highly technical talk

909
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,040
but hopefully something which has been

910
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,799
thought provoking

911
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:17,599
to you and will urge you to go out and

912
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,839

913
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,119
experience and knowledge that you have

914
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,480
