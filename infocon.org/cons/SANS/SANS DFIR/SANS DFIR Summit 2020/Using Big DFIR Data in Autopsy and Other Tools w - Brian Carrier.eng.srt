[Music]

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
i've got the great honor and privilege

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,839
of

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
introducing you today to dr brian

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
carrier and if you're

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
if you've been around forensics for a

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,680
while you obviously know uh no brian and

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,760
if you

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,680
haven't been around this is definitely

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
somebody that you want to keep track of

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,920
his uh his book on file system forensic

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,000
analysis is kind of one of the seminal

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,760
books in the dfir world which

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
really really takes you down to that

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,760
that atomic artifact

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
level awareness from up from a file

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,079
system

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,919
and certainly that's not the only thing

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
that he works with um he's also

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
a developer behind several tools a

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
sleuth kit and autopsy which

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
he'll be talking a bit about here today

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
and uh works with

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,760
basis technology on a variety of both

25
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
community facing

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,320
as well as uh you know contract

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,239
consulting type opportunities as well

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
um really good to have you here uh

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,000
someone i'm i'm glad to call a colleague

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,040
and a friend

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,040
and uh that all being said i'm eager to

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
hand this off to you sir for uh for

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
talking to us a little bit about

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,520
um using a big dfir data kind of a

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
follow-on to some of the things that i

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,920
just was talking about a minute ago so

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
i will hand it to you thanks um so

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
thanks for this opportunity to uh to

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,720
present on this topic of uh

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
big data uh and as phil said it kind of

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
ties in with some of the stuff uh

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
discussed

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,079
in the last talk um

44
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,560
there we go so uh for me one thing i

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
i've come to realize is one of my uh

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,400
kind of

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,880
um missions of the the work that i do

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
is all about kind of making uh examiners

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,520
more efficient

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
uh there's a lot of people out there on

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
the front lines whether they're

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,640
corporate incident response or law

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
enforcement or military who are dealing

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
with digital devices

55
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,520
and investigating them and what i really

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,479
kind of focus on is like how do we make

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,039
all these people

58
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
uh more efficient to deal with all the

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
diverse data sets

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,039
and size of data sets and that's really

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,880
kind of what we we focus a lot on

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
um some of these examples that um you

63
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
know we're going to tie into as part of

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,200
this talk

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,400
uh are being able to like automatically

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,799
flag things that you

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
uh tagged as bad before so you make sure

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
you see them again

69
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,959
uh another big thing that we're spending

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,959
time on is ranking

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
right it used to be forensics was all

72
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,879
just about like getting access to data

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,799
right be able to view a file system and

74
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,560
poke around every file and folder

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
uh or doing a keyword search and getting

76
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,480
lots of things um that's not enough

77
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,399
anymore there's just too much data

78
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,280
and it really needs some notion of kind

79
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
of ranking uh and prioritization

80
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,879
uh with things that you can spend your

81
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,440
limited time on those most important

82
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
things

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
um you know i like to view it as more of

84
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,640
a you know back in the day in the 90s

85
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
there was you know alta vista which was

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
the best search engine because it had so

87
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,518
much broad coverage

88
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,280
and then google came in and their main

89
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,120
thing right was the ranking algorithm

90
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
um i feel like in forensics we're still

91
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
quite a bit in that kind of

92
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,760
alta vista days of just showing you raw

93
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,280
data

94
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
and not helping the users really see the

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,200
most relevant stuff first

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
another main focus for us has been kind

97
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
of getting context about something

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,159
again we can show you things but being

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,080
able to show like why

100
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,679
it's used how it's been used where else

101
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,040
you've seen it to help you better

102
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
understand what you're seeing

103
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
um all these things that we've been

104
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,399
solving recently by

105
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,679
leveraging data that you might be

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,360
throwing away right now

107
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
a lot of people will go kind of case by

108
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,760
case right they'll make a new vm for

109
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,200
every case

110
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,440
uh coming from a mindset of

111
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,958
contamination and not wanting to bring

112
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,079
in data from a past case into the

113
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,720
current case

114
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
and keep everything clean um and yeah

115
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
getting a new vm every time and keeping

116
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
really contained helps you with that

117
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
problem

118
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,920
um but it means that these other

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
problems become much more challenging

120
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,798
and you can't solve them so we're gonna

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,239
talk today about reusing your data kind

122
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
of like a recycling approach instead of

123
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,440
throwing stuff away

124
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
uh you know recycling that reusing that

125
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
that data that you have as part of your

126
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
past case to help you in the future

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,000
so this all comes down to history

128
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
there's a a very old saying back in 2020

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,680
this guy carrier

130
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,280
uh kevin saying said uh you know those

131
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
who cannot remember the artifacts they

132
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
saw before

133
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,799
are condemned to analyze them again it's

134
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,599
a very kind of uh you know insightful

135
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,200
uh quote uh that's lasted for for many

136
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,200
generations and many things

137
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,199
uh has been parried over time uh

138
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,719
including this guy back in 1905

139
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
uh who said you know those who can't

140
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
remember the past you can repeat it

141
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,360
but this is a basic idea right we kind

142
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
of want to remember the history

143
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
in the past uh to keep memories of all

144
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
these things uh moving forward

145
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,639
in your future investigations and if you

146
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,960
think about it

147
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
um so much of what we do in forensics in

148
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,159
response

149
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,400
is based on the past right uh we're

150
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,720
trained at sans or other courses

151
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
uh to do things based on uh people

152
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
before us

153
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,280
what they thought was useful and what

154
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
they saw in the past our tools are

155
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,799
designed to focus on

156
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,758
data uh in locations that were useful in

157
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
past cases

158
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,720
uh hashes like the nist nsrl is hashes

159
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,800
that someone in the past that nist

160
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,639
knows that it came from a known software

161
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,240
uh and it's bringing in the past notion

162
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,199
of what what's useful or not

163
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,440
um hashtags for transportation are from

164
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,919
past cases iocs are from past cases

165
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
uh topic keywords or drugs or child

166
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,639
pornography or or hacking or whatever

167
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,638
are based on past experience um there's

168
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
so much of our investigations that are

169
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
based on

170
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,520
past knowledge that we bring in and the

171
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,880
trick is to kind of apply that past

172
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,198
knowledge to your current case

173
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,960
uh and figure out the new unique parts

174
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,639
of the current case

175
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,719
the challenge is scaling right it's hard

176
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,600
to remember all the notable things that

177
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
you've seen

178
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
it's even harder to know the things that

179
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,880
were notable in the past

180
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,400
that your colleagues saw and as we've

181
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
been going through trying to find things

182
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,280
on relevance and making sure you see the

183
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
most relevant things

184
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
we've also realized the boring stuff you

185
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,039
saw before is also interesting

186
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,039
uh because it was boring before it's

187
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,000
probably still boring and now it becomes

188
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,240
harder and harder

189
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,960
to keep on figuring out all this stuff

190
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
to remember the general solution here

191
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
is make your tools do all the

192
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,479
remembering right that's what software

193
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,159
is good at

194
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,159
that's what hardware is good at to store

195
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
things be your memory

196
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
save as much data as you can and then

197
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
figure out how to use it

198
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,960
uh we're gonna talk about talks the

199
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,759
features that we started building a few

200
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
years ago

201
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
for different reasons uh but started

202
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
collecting data and much like the past

203
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,758
talk on kind of data science and how

204
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,239
machine learning and ai and all these

205
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,000
things uh once you have data

206
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,520
it becomes really powerful in terms of

207
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
the things that you can do uh that you

208
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,799
didn't really anticipate

209
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,759
uh in the beginning so uh this talk

210
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
talks about two things

211
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
uh one is autopsy uh the other cyber

212
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,720
triage

213
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
on how we've used this concept of

214
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
collecting data uh and using it to help

215
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,758
the examiners

216
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,800
and the analysts be more efficient with

217
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,639
that so first let's talk about autopsy

218
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
um what is autopsy autopsy is an open

219
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,400
source general forensics platform

220
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
uh hopefully many people here know the

221
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,719
basics of it

222
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
there's a couple slides here just to

223
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,319
kind of get some context but

224
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,080
this talk is not really about a deep

225
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,240
dive on basics of autopsy

226
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,599
um but the basic goals of autopsy since

227
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
we redesigned it uh

228
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
five six years ago uh is on ease of use

229
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,039
uh to be

230
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
easily approachable kind of intuitive

231
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,440
out of the box and extensible we've got

232
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,960
a bunch of open plug-in frameworks

233
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,639
and a bunch of third-party modules you

234
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
can drop in uh to build

235
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
modules in python or java or whatever

236
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,119
high-level right we're supporting hard

237
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,720
drives midi cards smart phones

238
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
has all the standard features plus some

239
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
unique features

240
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
here's a basic screenshot tree on the

241
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,319
left-hand side

242
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,599
uh select something over here table over

243
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,599
here or thumbnails

244
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,199
uh choose something there get various

245
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,759
viewers on the lower right hand corner

246
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
not rocket science very simple intuitive

247
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
part of the whole kind of easy to use

248
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,240
concept here

249
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
the real trick here just kind of knowing

250
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
the kind of the structure of the tree

251
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,039
so you know what nodes to open up as

252
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
part of this again

253
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,280
basic kind of three panel ui flow here

254
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
there's other uis for timeline and

255
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,559
pictures and other things

256
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
but this is kind of the main default out

257
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,599
of the box ui

258
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
this is a screenshot of our training

259
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,000
course image uh brian moran if you're

260
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
in this course right now shout out to

261
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
him who made this data set

262
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
uh for our training set uh where renzik

263
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
our mascot here

264
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
uh goes missing uh and is part of the

265
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
training course you kind of solve uh you

266
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
know where he is

267
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,360
um high level features uh you know of

268
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,878
the tool on the left hand side you know

269
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
hash calculation keywords search

270
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,440
register analysis web artifacts email

271
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,520
carving

272
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
all the usual things um unique things

273
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,599
that aren't found in some commercial

274
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,759
tools

275
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,520
especially not for free are things like

276
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
multi-user collaborative cases

277
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
where you can have you know central

278
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,319
servers and multiple users working on

279
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,680
the same case at the same time

280
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,240
we think of auto ingest that

281
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,640
automatically analyzes data 24 7

282
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,719
if you put images into a folder a cool

283
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,559
thing called analysis driven acquisition

284
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
which means you plug like a hard drive

285
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
or media card

286
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,800
in and you start your analysis on that

287
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,279
as a byproduct it will make a vhd sparse

288
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
image

289
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,120
so you can kind of skip the acquisition

290
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
step and focus right on analysis

291
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
and then get that image as kind of a

292
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,240
byproduct and not take the time to

293
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,160
actually make the full acquisition

294
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
triage timeline communications there's a

295
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,040
whole bunch of stuff in there

296
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
uh not the point of talk except for to

297
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
give the big picture of there's a lot of

298
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,360
stuff in autopsy

299
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,439
that covers a lot of the features so um

300
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
today's topic is all about kind of big

301
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
data right collecting data keeping track

302
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
of things

303
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,680
i view autopsy in in cyber triage in two

304
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,199
concepts here kind of short-term memory

305
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,839
uh and long-term memory

306
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,519
so on the short-term memory uh autopsy

307
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,320
is much like a lot of other forensics

308
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,560
tools

309
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
where we organize things by case and the

310
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,119
main motivation for us and i'm sure the

311
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,200
other vendors

312
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,880
was this keeps data sets manageable it

313
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,040
keeps them smallish

314
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
and it also helps with kind of

315
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,079
contamination

316
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
kind of concerns some people have of you

317
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
can say all data if this one case is

318
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,240
here

319
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,600
i'm going to archive it it is separate

320
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,000
from this case over there

321
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,760
so every case an autopsy has a folder

322
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
it's got a database whether it's sql

323
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,800
light or postgres depending on if you're

324
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
a single user multi-user

325
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,959
you've got a solar index a bunch of

326
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
other things but they're all contained

327
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,399
uh you know at a case level

328
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,000
and then you know given that how much of

329
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
forensic since response

330
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,040
is the past you can bring in your past

331
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
knowledge

332
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
uh by things like hash sets a keyword

333
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,600
list

334
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
we have a concept called interesting

335
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,000
file rules uh which are basically folder

336
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,279
and file name rules to flag things

337
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
uh the next release has got a whole

338
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,480
bunch of rules on like cryptocurrency

339
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,120
wallets and cloud storage a bunch of

340
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
things but

341
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,279
you can basically bring in static

342
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,160
information from past cases

343
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,680
to help you with your current case great

344
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,040
most tools have this kind of this kind

345
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,279
of concept

346
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,439
so autopsy also has a long-term memory

347
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,320
uh we call it the central repository

348
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
and this allows you to span cases and is

349
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
dynamically updated

350
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,160
right so as you do things in the uh

351
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,079
software this database gets updated

352
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
based on what you're doing you can have

353
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
it be a single user or multi-user so

354
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
sqlite or postgres

355
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,079
and what it stores database what it

356
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,920
stores is identifiers

357
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,000
from your cases so as you're processing

358
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
a case identifiers get put in there

359
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and you can later use them so we're

360
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,199
storing things like md5 hash values

361
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,079
email addresses usb device ids uh wi-fi

362
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
ssids icc ids domain names a whole bunch

363
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,839
of stuff there's probably a dozen things

364
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
that we're stowing away in there for

365
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,680
future reference

366
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
we also store the notion of the case the

367
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,680
data source and the path

368
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,279
that you saw each of these in uh if you

369
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,760
make a comment on the file we'll store

370
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,000
that

371
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,040
if you tag a file we'll store that

372
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
basically we're storing this kind of

373
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,519
information on the things that are in

374
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
your cases

375
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
uh and how to how to kind of remember uh

376
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,160
where they actually came from

377
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,000
um this was kicking around uh internally

378
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
for quite a while uh we first released

379
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
it in 2017

380
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,200
uh but you had to kind of opt in you had

381
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,399
to turn it on um and the reason was that

382
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,519
there's a lot of people that were

383
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
concerned

384
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,320
about this kind of concept mainly in law

385
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,640
enforcement with search warrant scope

386
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,519
of they didn't want to kind of be using

387
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,240
data from

388
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
a child pornography case uh in a drug

389
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
case etc

390
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
so it was turned off by default while we

391
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,160
kind of figured some things out

392
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
but it's become much much more more

393
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,600
useful and so now it is on by default as

394
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
we'll see a little bit later on

395
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
uh but we've changed kind of the default

396
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,599
ways we use it

397
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,319
uh to kind of still uh satisfy the

398
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
concerns

399
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,920
about if people should be using it or

400
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,319
not depending on kind of search warrants

401
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,120
uh

402
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
in the scope of that so here's the

403
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
architecture of this right

404
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
on the left-hand side here uh you have

405
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,399
the current case database here's autopsy

406
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
and it can now access this historical

407
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,839
data as well as the keyword list

408
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,680
ioc's hash sets etc

409
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,839
so how to get data into there so there's

410
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,319
an ingest module so for those who uh

411
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
went to the autopsy training or uh just

412
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
haven't seen it before

413
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,920
of the concept of ingest modules that

414
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,200
run on the data source as you add it or

415
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,959
you can run them afterwards

416
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,519
this is where you do things like open up

417
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
zip files or pull out exif or run email

418
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,399
extraction

419
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
and there's a module called central

420
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
repository now in past versions up until

421
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
the one coming out in a couple weeks

422
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,160
it was called correlation engine uh it's

423
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,760
now been renamed a central repository

424
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,399
but it's the same idea this module is

425
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,480
responsible for getting data into

426
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,720
that central repository based on hash

427
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,000
values or things that like the email

428
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,880
parser is going to find with email

429
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,920
addresses

430
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,360
or domain names the other way it gets

431
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,040
updated is it's always listening

432
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
so when you tag a file when you right

433
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,519
click on something you say add file tag

434
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
it it's monitoring that and it record

435
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,639
the fact that you tagged that file

436
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
and we'll keep track of that

437
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
so how do you use it right that's how

438
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
good data gets in it's just it's passive

439
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,480
right you don't have to

440
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
know it's there right you just keep that

441
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
module enabled uh and stuff will be

442
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
going into that

443
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,160
the other thing you'll notice is that it

444
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,519
gets bigger and bigger uh but you know

445
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,079
it shouldn't be a problem

446
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
so now you need to use that data so one

447
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
easy thing is that you can automatically

448
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
flag

449
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,519
files uh that were marked notable uh in

450
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,959
a past case

451
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
we used the word notable we used to call

452
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,040
it bad uh we were told that was kind of

453
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
judgmental so now we call it notable

454
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480
it's relevant

455
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
so um it's called notable and it's

456
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,680
basically dynamic hashtag

457
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,279
right there are some labs that when an

458
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,359
examiner finishes their case

459
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
uh they will make they will update their

460
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
own local hashtag

461
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,720
with all the things that were tagged so

462
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,519
there's kind of an additional

463
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
a final step to make update their hash

464
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
sets

465
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
of things they found in this case to

466
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,920
make sure the future they also

467
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,279
uh find those things um this is dynamic

468
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,240
this happens automatically as soon as

469
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,000
you tag something

470
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,360
we're now keeping track of that and if

471
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
you see again in the future

472
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,279
uh you'll see in the tree under

473
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,880
interesting items those will get flagged

474
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,439
as things that were previously tagged as

475
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,199
notable

476
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
on a past case you'll click on it and

477
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
you'll see all the places it was tagged

478
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,480
before

479
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,160
you'll also see it in the table so the

480
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,959
upper right hand corner and we saw that

481
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,600
three panel

482
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,599
uh layout uh there's a table there's

483
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
three columns uh that usually occur

484
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
in the very beginning s c and o o is

485
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
occurrences

486
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,199
so this column will tell you how many

487
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,240
times this file

488
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,240
or other kind of artifact was seen in

489
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
past cases so this can tell you if

490
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
you're looking at a folder of files you

491
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,279
can say oh my god i've seen that 50

492
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
times i don't really care

493
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,800
or i've never seen it before maybe i

494
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
should focus on that so this is an easy

495
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,079
way

496
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,439
for you to see this and again our view

497
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,839
on this and we are not lawyers

498
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,959
uh but this is a very kind of passive

499
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,440
use of this past

500
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,518
data right the last one you could argue

501
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
uh is a bit kind of yeah maybe you're

502
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,240
searching data of two different case

503
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
types and you don't want to do that for

504
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,040
search warrant scope

505
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,480
um this one is much more passive this is

506
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
much more just saying hey

507
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
how common or rare is this file that i'm

508
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
looking at um and not kind of really

509
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,279
correlating

510
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,600
or finding intelligence or information

511
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
you know kind of based off of that

512
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
um the second one is on the on the lower

513
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,000
right hand corner uh we have the other

514
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,599
occurrences view

515
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,199
and this is basically showing that if

516
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
you choose an item this will show you

517
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,639
where else has been seen before

518
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,560
so it's organized such as this where the

519
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,040
left hand side or all the cases

520
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,880
uh that you saw that in the data sources

521
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,319
that were in the file name

522
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,720
this basically allows you to kind of

523
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,040
figure out you've seen this file before

524
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,160
uh maybe it is relevant uh you know for

525
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,759
it's part of the past case

526
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,680
maybe just you want to see how where it

527
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,279
actually is elsewhere but it's basically

528
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,959
easy way for you to kind of dive into a

529
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,279
given item you found some way

530
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,359
to see where else you've seen it these

531
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,079
are the main uses of of this data for

532
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,000
quite a while

533
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,000
right it's on this notion of correlation

534
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
and remembering your past data

535
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,920
um but with the past year or so we

536
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
started to use it all in different ways

537
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,279
which is on ranking right so as

538
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,319
mentioned before we've been focusing a

539
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,800
lot on

540
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,160
how do we kind of go beyond alta vista

541
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,920
and into google

542
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,680
and make sure that people can see with

543
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,240
all these like overwhelming amounts of

544
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,399
data

545
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,759
to find the relevant data first the

546
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,560
general theory that we have here

547
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,000
is if you've seen a file 10 times before

548
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,758
and it wasn't relevant

549
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
it's probably not relevant 11th time

550
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,040
either and if you've seen the title file

551
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,720
50 times before

552
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,560
that's even less relevant than one

553
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
you've only seen five times before

554
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,079
right and so we can use these things as

555
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,720
a way to kind of prioritize the data

556
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,160
you've seen

557
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
that's not to say this file you've seen

558
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,279
50 times before is actually it could

559
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
still be relevant

560
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,040
but it's it's we want to focus on the

561
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,319
unique things probably first

562
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,160
and the things that were previously

563
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,199
marked as bad

564
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,519
so we can do this with a central

565
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,959
repository that has all the data we know

566
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
what files we never tagged

567
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,480
we know of files we've seen before and

568
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
other artifacts domain names email

569
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,839
addresses all of those things

570
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,839
and we can use it to de-prioritize the

571
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,520
boring stuff and focus on

572
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,159
the unique and probably relevant stuff

573
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,520
so to satisfy this we have the data uh

574
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
we have a new ui it's called file

575
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,039
discovery

576
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
uh it came out in the january uh release

577
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,039
of autopsy this past year

578
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,799
um it's a search ui and the main idea is

579
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,960
to allow the user to define

580
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,240
uh what they're looking for now full

581
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,559
disclosure this is

582
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,080
incrementally uh release feature i'm a

583
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,440
big proponent of

584
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,280
you know making small incremental

585
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679
releases on things getting feedback

586
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
learning about stuff trying it uh versus

587
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,799
spending two years

588
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,000
on some major thing and realized it

589
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,879
didn't really quite work or it's a

590
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,480
little bit different

591
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,080
so every cordless has been coming out

592
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,679
with new features uh and

593
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
the whole thing kind of changed a bit as

594
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,120
we learn stuff uh

595
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,479
and apply stuff with this but the basic

596
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,159
idea is the user picks

597
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
things that they care about and how they

598
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,280
want to see the results and by having

599
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,439
such repository

600
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,480
and all this data it allows user to

601
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,640
focus on

602
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,799
uh and display based on past occurrence

603
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
so for example here's some queries we

604
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,200
have based on pictures just because

605
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,440
they're simple

606
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
there's equivalent ones for executables

607
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,559
uh for for more of the instant response

608
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
people in the audience

609
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,399
uh but here's just kind of a an obvious

610
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,880
one for for images and pictures

611
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
right if you want to see all unique uh

612
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,799
or rare pictures

613
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,280
uh that are big and you can organize

614
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,918
them by

615
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,600
parent folder so the basic idea here is

616
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,679
that you you as the examiner

617
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,439
want to focus on possibly user created

618
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,280
images that are big

619
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,360
and you want to see them in the same

620
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,520
structure they organize the owner

621
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,600
organize them if they had some kind of

622
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,440
folder structure to mean certain things

623
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,879
so you can do it you can define in i

624
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,320
want big and rare

625
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,120
and i want them organized by parent

626
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,678
folder sometimes you want to show

627
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
all pictures though but organized by

628
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,520
frequency

629
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,879
right so you may just want all big

630
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
pictures but you want to see the unique

631
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
ones first

632
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
and then focus on the other ones you can

633
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
so you can define the same criteria

634
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,559
but now you're going to use size as a

635
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,480
feature and group them by

636
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,879
by frequency so um ui looks like this

637
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
there's

638
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,039
you can choose the uh the type right now

639
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
we have these three uh web artifacts is

640
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,480
coming next

641
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,320
um executables will be after that uh

642
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
step two is kind of define the criteria

643
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,280
you want

644
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
so based on size based on data sources

645
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
they're in

646
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
based on the past occurrences that they

647
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,439
are

648
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,879
you pick the display options so you pick

649
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,400
how you want to group them

650
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,559
so instead it's giving you a long

651
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,960
laundry list of thousands of files

652
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,720
we force you to choose how to group them

653
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
again could be based on size

654
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
it could be based on past occurrences it

655
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
could be based on parent folder

656
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,280
all depends on your goals and how you

657
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,880
want to rank them

658
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,559
you get results such as this so again

659
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
this is more of a picture

660
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,480
this is actually from the same autopsy

661
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
training set these are grouped based on

662
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
size

663
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,439
and unique pictures only uh and so we

664
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,799
see here these are all the large files

665
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,120
which are in the range of one to fifty

666
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,679
megabytes the medium pictures are 100k

667
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,399
to

668
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
one megabyte uh we dedupe them so you

669
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,679
can see here this file was shown

670
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,360
was actually in two different locations

671
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
uh we only show it here once

672
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,039
we show you both locations and then you

673
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
can have the same viewer down here

674
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,480
to kind of dive into uh you know all

675
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,559
these different things

676
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
um there's a similar view for videos

677
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,158
where we show you video thumbnails

678
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
uh if there's a document we'll show you

679
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
kind of a summary of the documents a few

680
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,200
lines of text

681
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,120
um web things we're gonna have more of a

682
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
domain based view of this you can like

683
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,479
view the different domains which ones

684
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,159
have the most activity uh etc

685
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
so that's kind of basically idea um it's

686
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,840
a really powerful tool

687
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,039
uh i gotta admit we um we at some of our

688
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
our sites

689
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
where we have uh you know we help manage

690
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,719
and run uh

691
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
we've had this data uh central

692
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,200
repository running for over two years

693
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
um so we have you know over two years of

694
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
production data

695
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,158
uh that are coming through some of these

696
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,360
labs um and it's been really amazing to

697
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,080
then fire this up

698
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,918
and look at new cases and it really

699
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,360
allows you to kind of focus in on the

700
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,799
things that are probably relevant

701
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,199
uh because that you can see what's

702
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
unique uh and nsrl is a great tool a

703
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,320
great utility

704
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,240
uh for executables and things but it

705
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,158
really helps you to kind of ignore all

706
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,200
of the web icons

707
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,240
and things that you may find the

708
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
internet and things that are just kind

709
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,039
of boring and common

710
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,480
uh and really focus on the things that

711
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,320
are unique uh to that person

712
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
so uh now it's moody cyber triage that

713
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
was all about autopsy uh now it's food

714
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,960
is cyber treatise and

715
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,639
that that tool is kind of an evolving

716
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
thing uh for the next year at least we

717
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
will have kind of incremental features

718
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
uh you know for all that coming up

719
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,879
there's a lot of law movement on that

720
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,640
um so that's how a cyber triage so the

721
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
central repository is great

722
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
right it's collecting this data we're

723
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,559
always finding new ways to actually use

724
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,158
it

725
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,918
but the center repository is your

726
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,120
history right it only knows about what

727
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
you've put into it

728
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,239
um and this is good and bad right um

729
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
it's bad

730
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
because you haven't seen everything

731
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,799
before um and it may take a while to

732
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,080
build that data up

733
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,440
as i mentioned before we have some

734
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,639
people who have you know two years of

735
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,799
data on their systems

736
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,640
um some folks have zero or some folks

737
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,400
may only have for the past four months

738
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,840
when we actually turn it on by default

739
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,440
to start collecting this data

740
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
to be used for the kinds of relevance

741
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,840
ranking but it's good because honestly

742
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,760
something is better than nothing right

743
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,959
having four months of data to help you

744
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,440
with that is better than no months of

745
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
data

746
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,960
so this will keep on improving for

747
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,919
everybody um and the other reason this

748
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,679
is good is because

749
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,440
many labs are offline and even if

750
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,640
there's some bigger picture global

751
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,320
repository

752
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
they're not going to access it and at

753
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,399
least if they have their own data

754
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,840
that's better than no data at all so you

755
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
know it's a good bad right for the for

756
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,199
the cr

757
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
uh being kind of just your data but we

758
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,919
changed it for

759
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
for our cyber triage tool or in the

760
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,480
process of changing so what is cyber

761
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
trigger

762
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,360
so cyber triage is our intrusion

763
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,760
automated intrusion forensics tool

764
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,840
so while autopsy is a general purpose

765
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,879
tool right that you can use for

766
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,199
uh interest or murder cases or

767
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,679
um you know fraud cases or terrorism

768
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,480
cases or child pornography cases

769
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,799
right you can suffer anything right um

770
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,520
cybertria are just hyper focused on just

771
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,679
intrusion-related artifacts right so it

772
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,840
knows where to find the artifacts for

773
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,960
things like startup items and auto runs

774
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,080
and program

775
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,360
run items web artifacts wmi actions

776
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,879
logins networks

777
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,280
all the artifact types you care about

778
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
for intrusions around user activity and

779
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,918
malware

780
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
um it knows where to find those things

781
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
it brings them in it scores them

782
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,199
uh and gives you kind of scores as bad

783
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,799
or suspicious

784
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,240
and then the user can then review the

785
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,240
high threat items and dive in

786
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,480
so there's a big concept of cyber triage

787
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,400
of this notion of of ranking

788
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,760
to kind of elevate the things uh that

789
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,320
you should spend your time on

790
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,879
versus just dumping a whole bunch of

791
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,960
process

792
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
data uh or things in front of you to try

793
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
and figure out what you're the most

794
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,000
likely to look at

795
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,360
so here's a screenshot of that bit

796
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,840
different than autopsy

797
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,719
uh left hand side or all data types uh

798
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,799
user uh

799
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
things accounts logins what network

800
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
shares they access what programs they

801
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,039
ran

802
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,879
uh web artifacts they accessed uh you

803
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,240
know malware around persistence things

804
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,600
that are running et cetera

805
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,120
so you can choose these things it's a

806
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,639
timeline on the right-hand side that

807
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,439
shows you kind of what the time

808
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,960
stamps are for the um the bad items to

809
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,760
allow you to kind of get a mental model

810
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
of the events

811
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,360
but basically kind of you know easy to

812
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,719
use kind of navigate uh tool

813
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,918
uh and these things are showing you kind

814
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,360
of the the bad and the suspicious items

815
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,120
so let's start with the memory right

816
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,240
back to autopsy that had short-term and

817
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,639
long-term memory

818
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
um cyber triggers are similar right uh

819
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,240
cemetery started life off actually as an

820
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
autopsy module

821
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,320
uh they went their own ways uh because

822
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,840
autopsy was cybertrader was so much more

823
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,000
focused on

824
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
different kinds of data and live running

825
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,919
systems and the infrastructure

826
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,120
to have collection tools uh you know

827
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
running and

828
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,639
just kind of different infrastructure um

829
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,199
but the same

830
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,159
concepts are still exist in cyber triage

831
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,919
and autopsy

832
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,679
right so we have databases for storing

833
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,960
the artifacts at an incident level it's

834
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
the same as the case

835
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,720
which is called incidents in cyber

836
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,799
triage it remembers your past scores

837
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,720
your tags your comments etc

838
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,559
so that when you can see in your future

839
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,760
uh collections you can see what you

840
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,000
marked in the past

841
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,360
how common or rare something is and so

842
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
with this data

843
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
we look at an artifact like a startup

844
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
item or a program run entry

845
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
it'll show you what past cases you saw

846
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,799
it in and if it was marked as bad

847
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,799
in the past so again we're trying to

848
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
leverage as much as possible that past

849
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,559
data to help you out

850
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
and with this you can figure out is this

851
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,399
artifact unique to the system

852
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,158
um or you know other systems that may

853
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
have it right so uniqueness is really

854
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,520
important as we've discussed before

855
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,960
uh the last talk right it's very

856
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
important to find uniqueness

857
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,520
uh because those are usually the ones

858
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,120
that are tied to uh malware or attacks

859
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,400
and you're kind of the outliers so being

860
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
able to have that information is very

861
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,279
useful

862
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,199
and then once you do find that you may

863
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,360
find four or five other systems

864
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,240
as part of a scoping exercise that you

865
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,840
also want to see

866
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,520
and if you have that date available it

867
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,918
makes it easy to find those initial ones

868
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,840
to start scoping to

869
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
so you can see this in cyber triage in

870
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,120
the table view of cyber triage

871
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,520
on the right hand side there's usually a

872
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,678
column that says scene before

873
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,360
this data is actually a bit boring it's

874
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,880
it's from one of my systems that i had

875
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
to reset a little while ago

876
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,080
uh this is the downside of running a

877
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,080
development uh environment as well

878
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,520
but it basically shows you that um you

879
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,559
know this this item here

880
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,559
uh must be a chrome executable um

881
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,678
was you know seen 12 times before which

882
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,080
is all the incidents

883
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,520
uh this one's seen none before uh this

884
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,480
number here is if they were marked as

885
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,320
bad before

886
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
but allows you to kind of dive in and

887
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,760
see how common or rare something is as

888
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,279
part of that

889
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,000
so that's great right that helps you

890
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,600
find the outliers um that you know just

891
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
that you know of as part of your past

892
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,120
cases

893
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,559
um but you know you can focus on the

894
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,399
unique ones it's all good

895
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,399
um but sometimes your past cases aren't

896
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
enough right uh we have several cyber

897
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,080
traders customers who

898
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,600
uh you know don't do a lot of insurance

899
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,320
investigations right maybe they do once

900
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,399
a month

901
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,678
um and they like the kind of the ease of

902
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,279
use to cyber triage

903
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,520
but it takes a while for them to get all

904
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,039
that data built up to really get an idea

905
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
of common or rare

906
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,600
and maybe they're actually part of you

907
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,879
know they have a whole bunch of other

908
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,240
security roles

909
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
and they aren't memorizing all the

910
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
processes that they need to be keeping

911
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,000
track of

912
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,000
at all times and so they want kind of

913
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,640
more context about what startup items

914
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
and things

915
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
are actually common or rare uh in in

916
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
environments

917
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,840
uh so wouldn't it be useful to know how

918
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,520
common or rare something is

919
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,120
amongst others in the industry as

920
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
overall

921
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,360
so um we started to make this global

922
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,039
repository uh for file hashes

923
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,360
um again we like to do things

924
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,000
incrementally so uh focusing just on

925
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
kind of file

926
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
hashes as the first starting point um

927
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,840
and so we're building this up and we're

928
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,320
gonna

929
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,959
bring this into cyber triage as a way of

930
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,120
giving

931
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,360
kind of bigger picture view on kind of

932
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,158
how common or rare something is

933
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,039
so um cybertriage comes along with an

934
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,760
online

935
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,520
file reputation service um it's it's a

936
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,840
it's a service endpoint that we have

937
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,679
uh it identifies a file as being good

938
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,840
they're bad or suspicious

939
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,080
it's backed up by reversing labs which

940
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
is which is a service like virustotal

941
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,000
it's got 40 plus malware scanning

942
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,639
engines um so when you're using cyber

943
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
triage

944
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,720
you can upload hash values or file

945
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,159
content and get results back and if we

946
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
know about it we'll tell you about it

947
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,240
we're also going to reverse labs and get

948
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,000
their opinions on these things um and

949
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,000
it's been story anonymous data

950
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,200
about hash frequency it's not tied to

951
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,600
anyone it's not stored

952
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,720
any association of who it came from

953
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,639
where it came from

954
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
uh it's just keeping track of that this

955
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
hash value was requested

956
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,439
uh information about it uh and the idea

957
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
here

958
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,559
is that this has been going on since

959
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,520
like february um the idea here is that

960
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,200
as this goes on

961
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,720
uh we'll be able to kind of then provide

962
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
results to you uh

963
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,799
as you're looking for things to find out

964
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,120
is this hash value unique

965
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,720
no one's been seeded before is it rare

966
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,760
that a couple of people have or a couple

967
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
users have

968
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,520
it's common etc so we're not going to

969
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,600
provide core numbers we're just going to

970
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,840
provide kind of generic information

971
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,678
and again this is all anonymous you know

972
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,678
not tied to any specific kind of

973
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,520
company or instant or whatever but the

974
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,000
idea here is that how can we provide

975
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,600
some basic feedback to people about kind

976
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,399
of frequency analysis

977
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,360
uh you know of these items so this is

978
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,639
the architecture of that

979
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,719
uh your cyber treasure in the middle

980
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,640
here it's got local instant database

981
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,159
it's local historical repository and

982
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
then has access to

983
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,240
this global historical repository to get

984
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,279
information on kind of frequency

985
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,039
analysis

986
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,960
in the community um after we

987
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
roll this out uh there's also plans to

988
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
roles to other artifact types

989
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
again in the incremental idea here start

990
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,799
with file hashes that's pretty easy we

991
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,720
understand file hash functions

992
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,240
but the idea here is that how do we

993
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,960
extend that concept

994
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,760
to other data types uh besides just file

995
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,559
content

996
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,000
so one example this is all tbd uh it

997
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,240
hasn't been finalized yet

998
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
but for startup items right uh one way

999
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,559
to kind of make a hash

1000
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,760
for a startup item would be to normalize

1001
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,158
the path

1002
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,440
and kind of hash the string so maybe the

1003
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,320
path is you know c

1004
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,960
user jdo app data local temp you know

1005
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,080
blah.exe is the program being run

1006
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,520
as a startup item uh one idea is

1007
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,439
you know we normalize it so we make it

1008
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,600
all lowercase uh we pull out the

1009
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,600
username jdo here that's irrelevant

1010
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,639
uh to what the actual username is uh and

1011
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
that will kind of you know

1012
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
different usernames we'll call it

1013
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,039
different uh different hash values

1014
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,279
um make it a lowercase and then run it

1015
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,080
through shot 256 or md5 whichever

1016
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,240
whatever we

1017
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,279
choose for that but that becomes kind of

1018
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,080
a hash value

1019
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,080
uh for that startup item maybe we want

1020
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,520
to tie in the key that it was in whether

1021
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,120
it was kind of a run once

1022
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,559
maybe it's irrelevant a bunch of things

1023
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,158
to think about here's part of this but

1024
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
the idea here is that once we roll this

1025
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,000
out

1026
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,559
um to start to kind of just for other

1027
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
items uh and ideally this is a kind of a

1028
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
community effort right there's nothing

1029
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,640
unique here

1030
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,960
that we're doing as part of this so

1031
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,760
ideally there's some kind of concept of

1032
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,200
we can all build up uh hashes for

1033
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,960
different kinds of artifacts

1034
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,559
to allow us to correlate these things

1035
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,720
anonymously um

1036
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,240
you know with lookup tables kind of

1037
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,559
things versus more

1038
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,440
very descriptive verbose kind of jsony

1039
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,519
kind of things

1040
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,679
and also coming soon before the other

1041
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,159
stuff is that autopsy will use this as

1042
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,120
well

1043
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,679
so uh by the end of the year i i i

1044
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,918
assume

1045
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,600
uh we will have an autopsy module that

1046
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,360
will be able to use the same repository

1047
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,439
and so you're running data sets through

1048
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,240
autopsy it can reach out to that rest

1049
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,399
api

1050
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,919
uh and query that and both use the

1051
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,360
malware scanning capabilities

1052
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,600
uh as well as kind of give you that

1053
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,959
frequency analysis uh you know for how

1054
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,039
common or rare something is

1055
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,559
uh just to give you that more context in

1056
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,720
your in your investigations

1057
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:39,760
uh and how common rare something is uh

1058
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
you know around the world

1059
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,320
so uh in summary right uh saving your

1060
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,080
data uh can be really important uh to

1061
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,439
solving you know your kind of future big

1062
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,199
data problems and we all

1063
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
either currently have big data problems

1064
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,039
of kind of overwhelming data

1065
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,159
uh or it's it's getting even worse uh

1066
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,840
you know coming up

1067
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,159
and relevance and ranking i think are

1068
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,120
the huge uh problem to solve

1069
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,840
uh right now uh in in forensics outside

1070
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
of the usual

1071
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,559
there's a lot of data types a lot of

1072
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
databases to parse all this kind of

1073
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,039
things

1074
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,518
it's really about how do we make this

1075
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,559
data available and bump up the highest

1076
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,399
priority items

1077
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,000
uh to the user examiner so basically

1078
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,320
idea here is don't throw data

1079
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,840
away right reuse it um hopefully your

1080
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,439
tools that you have

1081
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,360
are able to kind of start keeping track

1082
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,960
of this um and you can leverage it

1083
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,279
either now or in the future

1084
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,720
um or maybe these global databases will

1085
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,399
kind of help out as well but

1086
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,919
if you don't do it locally you can

1087
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,678
benefit from that by others

1088
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,600
kind of putting them in and remember the

1089
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,760
great old uh classic saying

1090
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,120
uh by that guy carrier on uh those

1091
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,440
examples artifacts

1092
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,959
they saw before are condemned to analyze

1093
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,360
them again

1094
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,600
um two other quick things uh osgfcom uh

1095
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,399
is our annual open source event

1096
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,600
uh we've had it for 10 years now uh

1097
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,239
october 21

1098
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,080
2020 is the current date for it um it

1099
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,320
will be virtual this year as everything

1100
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,559
else is with all these events going on

1101
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,799
the agenda is still being figured out uh

1102
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,960
we crowdsource voting for the agenda and

1103
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,200
that finished last week i think

1104
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,559
um but topics typically include instant

1105
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,960
response memory

1106
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,678
uh you know correlation a whole bunch of

1107
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,080
cloud

1108
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,840
a whole bunch of things are there um

1109
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,639
it's always been free for us government

1110
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,158
employees

1111
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,240
uh we're still trying to figure out all

1112
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,559
the registration details uh

1113
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,600
with kind of the virtual notion uh you

1114
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,039
know of it this year

1115
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,039
uh but there is the website down below

1116
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,679
osgfon.org you can sign up for updates

1117
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,760
on there

1118
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,519
if you aren't already to be notified

1119
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,559
when that becomes available

1120
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,480
um so zap there's training so

1121
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,080
uh there is an hour eight hour online

1122
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,519
training available for autopsy

1123
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,600
i saw a bunch of references twitter

1124
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,640
already on the discord um app

1125
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,279
uh we offered it for free uh for a while

1126
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,360
for covid um i thought we'd get a few

1127
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
thousand people who signed up for it uh

1128
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,199
take advantage of it

1129
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,879
we had a hundred thousand people uh

1130
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,760
enroll for that and go through it was

1131
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
crazy

1132
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,840
uh there's a lot of support tickets and

1133
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,440
things that went through there

1134
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,760
thanks to brian moran for helping out

1135
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,200
with all of that

1136
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,200
the training though is still free for

1137
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,840
u.s law enforcement through 2020

1138
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,599
uh we made this through some dhs uh

1139
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,159
science technology uh contracts and

1140
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,320
grants

1141
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,760
uh and so uh that therefore it's still

1142
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,520
free for us law enforcement

1143
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,679
uh through the end of the year um and in

1144
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,440
cyber triage we've got a free um

1145
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,960
three hour kind of intro ir training

1146
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,000
coming out next month uh and then

1147
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,760
there'll be an eight hour

1148
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
class coming in the fall uh you know for

1149
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,040
that um

1150
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,638
downloads contact uh you can get autopsy

1151
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,879
for free at atops.com

1152
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,119
uh there's a free evaluation uh for

1153
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,359
cybertriage cybertriage.com

1154
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,159
uh there's my email you catch me on

1155
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,560
linkedin

1156
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,079
or twitter i am terrible at both of them

1157
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,679
i will be honest uh

1158
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,839
but email is much more reliable to

1159
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,000
actually get in touch with me

1160
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,839
so that's it

1161
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,760
excellent thank you very very much

1162
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,279
there's some great conversation going in

1163
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
the uh and the discord

1164
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
and a bunch of questions came in as well

1165
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,839
um i'll be honest i don't think we'll

1166
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,200
have time to get through all the

1167
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,400
questions here with you but

1168
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,000
i wanted to pick um there's a couple of

1169
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,320
them that were in a similar theme

1170
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,240
kind of centering around uh or centering

1171
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,000
on uh scalability

1172
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,319
there were some questions on scalability

1173
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,960
with the the database or if hadoop is

1174
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,640
concerned

1175
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,040
uh being considered in eo1 size

1176
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,200
like is there any congenital metrics you

1177
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,040
can provide about scalability and most

1178
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,200
of those questions were specifically on

1179
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,000
the autopsy side of the talk

1180
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,799
sure yeah so um so we've done quite a

1181
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,920
bit to kind of

1182
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,119
um make you know in our experience

1183
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,160
so so so content-wise uh you know or

1184
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,440
infrastructure-wise

1185
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
uh as you mentioned before it's all

1186
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,359
relational point right it's postgres

1187
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,480
uh you know for kind of the one to scale

1188
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,920
the most um

1189
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,760
when we first kicked this off we did a

1190
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,280
bunch of evaluations on

1191
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,320
relational versus versus elastic

1192
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,480
versus whatever

1193
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,440
um postgresql gave us by far the best

1194
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,359
performance

1195
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,119
uh you know for kind of inserting and

1196
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,400
querying uh for that

1197
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,000
um and essentially it's because all

1198
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,599
we're doing is making rows right we're

1199
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
making basic rows of

1200
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,040
here's the hash value here's the case

1201
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
name here's the file you know the case

1202
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,000
index or

1203
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,520
id reference whatever um and they're

1204
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,440
actually pretty fast uh

1205
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,640
inserts that we do when we batch them up

1206
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,320
so um

1207
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,960
it it that was by far the best

1208
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,040
performance uh you know whys of that

1209
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,119
um things like hadoop really become

1210
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,640
important if we want to

1211
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,000
actually do a lot of kind of clustering

1212
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,319
analysis or things we found

1213
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,520
that's better for for clustering things

1214
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,560
but for the simple tasks that we're

1215
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,280
doing of more of like

1216
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,240
inserts uh inquiry to see how common or

1217
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
rare something is

1218
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,598
um i mean postgres is is really good

1219
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,440
good enough for that

1220
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,839
um we do break the the the tables up by

1221
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,200
type

1222
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,040
uh to keep them small right in our

1223
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,040
experience the real performance hits

1224
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,640
comes when tables get far too big

1225
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,079
uh and so we have been doing a lot to

1226
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,000
kind of keep the table small

1227
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,160
uh to keep you know file hashes separate

1228
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
then uh your domains separate

1229
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,359
email address except for whatever uh

1230
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,359
kind of keep those keep those small

1231
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,839
but yeah the final thing is that you

1232
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,839
know we do have you know this place that

1233
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,599
uh sculptures that have you know a

1234
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,759
couple years of data on them

1235
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,200
this is not the bottleneck right solar

1236
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,400
uh historically has been more the

1237
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,720
bottleneck

1238
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,800
for kind of performance uh in things

1239
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,240
than actually maintain this database

1240
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,920
just for kind of context for reference

1241
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,839
yeah i've seen that a number of times as

1242
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,599
well um

1243
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,880
so excellent well i i realize we're

1244
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,839
getting ready to head into lunch so

1245
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,800
here's what i'm going to do

1246
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,440
um i'm going to ask our moderators to

1247
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,280
not

1248
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,960
kill off the the questions that are

1249
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
still outstanding i'm going to get those

1250
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
don't worry

1251
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,440
i'll actually copy paste those into your

1252
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
hallway um it'll be a bit of a

1253
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,839
dump but that way we're not losing

1254
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,880
because there are some really good

1255
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,799
questions that i

1256
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,079
i think you'll have some quick easy

1257
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,599
insight to it's just with

1258
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,359
with the timing i don't want to uh i

1259
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,240
don't want to push stuff too too far one

1260
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,078
way or the other

1261
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,680
sure um so that all said thank you very

1262
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,400
much for sharing with us um

1263
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,000
excellent material as always really some

1264
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,680
some of the classic tools in

1265
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,440
the forensic toolkit and it's uh it's

1266
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,359
always nice to hear from

1267
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,280
someone such as yourself who's so close

1268
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,440
to the creation of tools like that and

1269
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,040
really give us the that's the closest

1270
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
information we can get on them so it's

1271
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,359
uh it's pretty awesome to get the info

1272
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,240
away from the course

1273
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,920
thanks um absolutely thank you for your

1274
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:22,759
time and for sharing

1275
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,760
[Music]

1276
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
you
