2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
we have called the dfir to go or defer

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,680
to go

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
it's actually just an area where we kind

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,359
of said this would be a

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
good opportunity for us to follow back

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
up on some of the biggest takeaways

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,359
we've had from

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
all the talks and just the experience

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,039
overall um the last

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
two days before we go into uh to finish

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,480
things out with

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
uh with daryl coming back and then some

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,680
fun stuff we've got for the afternoon

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,599
if you want to see all of us and

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,719
everyone's faces if you change to the

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,760
gallery view

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,440
in your own view you should see the

19
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,960
like a single line and it builds up if

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,280
you've never used zoom and you want to

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
do

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
show grid video and then you can drag it

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,680
out

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,120
and that way you can see anyone else

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
here as well so right now it's just

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
going to be like allison

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,559
brian rob yeah we're going to bring some

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,439
more folks in

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,720
yes also there has been a request and

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,000
this is actually a pretty

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
neat idea and i like it if you spoke at

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
the d first summit

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,839
if you could go into your hallway and

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
just put your twitter handles

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,040
and then phil and i can go through or

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
someone from sans can go through while

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,040
we're doing this and pin it to the

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,360
channel

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,720
that way anyone can easily follow you

40
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,119
that was a request and i think that's a

41
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,039
good one and someone else reached out

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,280
they had a hard time finding

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
the sweet forensic thing shirt in the

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,159
store and it's on their shop

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,640
men's it is currently sold out

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,520
um we had way more orders than we had

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
expected

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
um so stand by watch our twitter account

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,399
um we will definitely

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
make a point of letting you know when

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
that is back

52
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,880
things where you know when we've got a

55
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,240
limited amount of stock and uh

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
everybody crushes it like you did

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
yesterday morning that's why

58
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,799
you don't want to be like old navy and

59
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,719
sell it and then just never deliver it

60
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
we don't want to be like maybe no well

61
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,000
you wanna you wanna know what's my fault

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,318
because i i'm a kind of ocd

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
about these shirts that on the original

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,599
version of the shirt it was supposed to

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,399
have on the back in addition to summit

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,720
11.

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
it's supposed to have artifacts don't

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,760
lie is because the friends don't lie

69
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,679
and i was like oh that was the entire

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,679
point of the shirt um

71
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
so we printed the shirts and went into

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
stock and we used to have fema uh

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
women's shirts i think those sold out a

74
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
while ago so we're just burning through

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,480
the stock

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,000
that's left right now um but uh we do

77
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,640
the women honestly do have a the coolest

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
hoodie um that's out there a lot of men

79
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,079
have asked well where's my hoodie

80
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,760
it's like we don't have one for you only

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,800
the women have the cool hoodie

82
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,560
um but that is if for any of the uh

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
women who are looking for a women's fit

84
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
that is a really good

85
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,559
uh hoodie to go take a look at that's

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
also limited stock too

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
uh we're not printing on demand of those

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
so we had to order our pre-order all of

89
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,840
those

90
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,840

that are being asked a lot uh recordings

104

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
right along where uh you had uh had

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,280
previously joined these sessions um that

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,798
could take days for us to finalize and

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
get those posted up and ready

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
slide decks will be within a couple of

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
hours same place

uh when they're available

115
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,120
we have a lot of stuff now we just don't

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,120
have this particular shirt uh is

117
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
sansgear.com

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,839
that way i can clear like 15 of the

119
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,839
questions that are here

120
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,359
all right oh here's a good one

121
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,240
somebody's asking about our background

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
that we've got here

123
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
um i will we will find a way to post the

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,680
link for

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,599
of that so you can use that in your own

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,400
zooms

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
that's a good question

128
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,758
all right um well heather what do you

129
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,159
think what do you want to start out on

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,759
uh

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,400
on what your your biggest takeaway was

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,199
oh that's a good one my biggest takeaway

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,198
from the whole thing

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,919
um i think that we the harshest critic

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
of anyone in diefer is usually yourself

136
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,799
so whether

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,880
you put any bias out there you're

138
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
usually the most biased against yourself

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,479
without realizing it so i think people

140
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,758
really need to just start using their

141
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,000
voice

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,120
research document and share

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,800
it's a good one yeah i like that i just

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
pulled that out of nowhere

145
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,280
that was good well that means that it's

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,320
the then it's the right answer

147
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,440
um you know i've got a i think i think a

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,680
lot of the takeaway just on

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,400
collaboration and communication was

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,680
was really just uh woven throughout a

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,198
lot of the talks which was

152
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,880
was really awesome um i also

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,080
think from an artifact perspective so

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
maybe i'll come back and ask you the

155
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
same question for more of like an

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
artifact or low-level technical

157
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,960
uh kind of a point my biggest technical

158
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
takeaway was actually ryan benson

159
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,039
describing the unfurl

160
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,599
uh project that he he did in conjunction

161
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,159
with obsidian and google and

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,520
really really amazed me how much more

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
information is buried in the urls

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,919
see what i said urls of some of the uh

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
the cloud services that i realized were

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
there i mean there's

167
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,559
an infinite number of potential

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
artifacts but um

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,400
you know looking into some of what what

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,600
were called the snowflake

171
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,198
uh fields were was really fascinating

172
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,880
not only can it be broken out into

173
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,080
various components like time stamps and

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,479
machine ids

175
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,840
but anytime i see some kind of

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,360
uniqueness

177
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,119
anytime i see some kind of uh

178
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
you know something that i can move

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
across multiple evidence sources to find

180
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
one

181
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
originating event it becomes very

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
interesting to me

183
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,840
and sometimes using an entire url is not

184
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,758
valid it's this one component now that

185
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,198
i think it's going to bear a lot more

186
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,639
research so

187
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,960
i already have it in the back of my mind

188
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,160
how i like to rewrite or add on to some

189
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,400
of our labs in forensics 572

190
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,919
to use specifically the unfurl tool and

191
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,520
pull some more value out of that so

192
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,758
we'll see where that goes you just said

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,758
earl

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,880
that was accidental he was saying a word

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,119
that had it now i know

196
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,800
it was still yeah i know but it's it's

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
embedded in the word now you can't

198
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
you can't unhear it once you hear it

199
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
and you know what phil to chime in on

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,120
what you just said uh

201
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,159
jared his talk on

202
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,319
lucky ios 13 or lucky number 13

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
the gambling talk very

204
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,479
very similar to the things that are

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,800
happening and the artifacts that

206
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,560
how smart your phones actually are so

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,759
like the tp

208
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,199
possibly topic detection and if he used

209
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
an example in his chat if you missed it

210
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,120
if you were in track one

211
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
where he used an example where he was

212
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
texting with his uncle

213
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,800
and he doesn't have him saved it would

214
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
be like let's say rob is my uncle uncle

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,280
rob

216
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,799
he has him saved as rob but because he

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,159
refers to him all the time like happy

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
birthday uncle rob

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
or hi uncle rob this database knew that

220
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,960
rob lee

221
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
is uncle rob which is creepy it's

222
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
amazing

223
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,599
what we can actually get if we unfurl

224
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,810
bingo with a phrase that pays

225
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,810
[Laughter]

226
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,000
we'll get to you in a minute rob you

227
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,400
always have some good stuff to say

228
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
um jessica welcome back um what are you

229
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,878
doing i think your biggest takeaways

230
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,799
were out of the

231
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,160
event this this year so it's really

232
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
interesting because one of my biggest

233
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,080
takeaways was in the communication

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,000
um on discord and how much networking

235
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,159
was available to people who ordinarily

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
wouldn't necessarily be talking to each

237
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
other be it because of their geolocation

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
in the world

239
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
or because of their temperament maybe

240
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,478
they're not somebody who's comfortable

241
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
going up to you face to face and talking

242
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,640
but oh my gosh so many great

243
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,200
conversations so many great dms

244
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,399
both technical and people who i mean

245
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,240
i've got at least

246
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,800
three calls next week scheduled to talk

247
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,160
with people about things in their future

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
things they're looking at things they're

249
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,120
researching and the collaboration that's

250
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,680
going to happen

251
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,519
that comes out of this is going to be

252
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,239
extensive so i can't wait to see what

253
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,399
people do

254
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
with the connections and collaboration

255
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,720
that they're making as a result of this

256
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
and what

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,519
next year's talks will be where what

258
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
what will be the things that top

259
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,120
amazing research i mean you guys talked

260
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,600
about great technical talks

261
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
um and you know on top of that matt

262
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,000
sayer and david collins talk

263
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,600
about how to do the live analysis and

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
how much time that's going to save us in

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,560
validation

266
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,000
in terms of ensuring that we understand

267
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
artifacts more thoroughly

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,440
and that we can test changes in better

269
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,319
and easier ways

270
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,680
i mean just incredible the amount of

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
ways that people are thinking

272
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,519
also about those keynotes and how

273
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,880
motivating

274
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,600
lee daryl ladrina and matt were

275
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
uh and owen as far as how we can give

276
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
back

277
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,320
the the theme was so resonant throughout

278
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,079
the whole thing and i've had so many

279
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
conversations with people about

280
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,959
what kinds of projects they're thinking

281
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
about about how they can get more

282
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,640
involved

283
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
in the community and i just kind of

284
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
asked for a better

285
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
takeaway that's just amazing to me fills

286
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,279
my heart

287
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
i you know what jess i was talking about

288
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,800
this yesterday

289
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,880
and i think i think we should possibly

290
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,399
when we're live rob

291
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
and clearly i don't know that we'll ever

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
be fully live because now we opened up

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
this can of worms where anyone can

294
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,720
attend remotely

295
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
but i think even if we are live we

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
should have discord because

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,399
people normally wouldn't speak to one

298
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,800
another

299
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
discord

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,279
it removes a barrier of intimidation to

301
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
be honest

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,480
and also people um some of the anonymity

303
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
has also helped people i know that's

304
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
weird because i know that there was this

305
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
comment about people should use their

306
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
real names

307
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
but there were some people who i think

308
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,480
feel more comfortable with anonymity

309
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,839
and can actually voice their opinions

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,120
that way and their their profession may

311
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,880
preclude

312
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,160
yeah i actually agree with that the the

313
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,279
one thing that i think we need to do a

314
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,920
better job of is

315
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,040
you know discuss even though we have the

316
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
hallway channels

317
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,480
is that like the main track channels get

318
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,720
uh it's there's it's just

319
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,600
too fast a stream to catch there's

320
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,360
discussions

321
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
and without threading it's hard to

322
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,880
potentially peel off a discussion in the

323
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,839
middle of that

324
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,600
so i think the hallway channels were i

325
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,959
found today i wasn't paying attention to

326
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
them much yesterday

327
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,920
and then i went into them today during

328
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,760
the talks and i said oh this is much

329
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,040
easier to

330
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,640
follow and see the content and seeing

331
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,439
people directly interface with the

332
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
content

333
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,120
and the thoughts where the main channels

334
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,160
seem to be

335
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,760
you know half content half people

336
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
thinking about just random you know

337
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,839
squirrel thoughts at the same time

338
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,560
not saying that's wrong it just it was

339
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
harder to stay focused on what the major

340
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
content was and that's why the hallway

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,399
channels ended up being a huge benefit

342
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,479
yeah i agree i think if there was a

343
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,320
little bit if we direct people to use

344
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,200
the hallway channels to

345
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
discuss the topics at hand the content

346
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,560
of the talk

347
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,600
and use use the track channels to

348
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,839
discuss the

349
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
the jokes and the things in between and

350
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,160
the announcements for things on the

351
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
track that's

352
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,000
probably a better organizational space

353
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,839
especially with lack of threading

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,839
i think

355
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,320
but just amazing the way everybody

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,399
communicated and talked together and

357
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,440
just what a great experience i'm super

358
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,480
stoked for

359
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,200
for what's gonna happen next

360
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,560
i i actually feel that um that maybe

361
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
there's a way and i know phil you

362
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,479
mentioned some of this in one of your

363
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,560
intros earlier on track one

364
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,240
that there's the community that

365
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
continues from this

366
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
as opposed to this being an isolated

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,880
event i actually think that there's a

368
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,120
really big opportunity from that to have

369
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,480
collaborative forums of people who have

370
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
ideas and meet from here and

371
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,160
i don't know the right way um or the

372
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
best way that stands to potentially

373
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,760
execute that but i think that there's

374
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,279
almost a hunger and a third for it

375
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
i know heather mentioned the digital

376
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,839
forensics discord server that's a great

377
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,399
place where over 5000 examiners already

378
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,920
are

379
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,880
but i mean what can we do to keep the

380
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,880
momentum right

381
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,800
yeah um it's kind of funny because we we

382
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,560
normally keep some of this conversation

383
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,839
until like the very very end so it gets

384
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,079
squashed into like this

385
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,279
30-second blob of words

386
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
i'm glad we get a chance to talk a

387
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,160
little bit about this kind of stuff now

388
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
because

389
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
um one of the things that i always tell

390
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,680
people at the end of the summits is now

391
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,959
that you've seen this

392
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,800
how many of you are going to

393
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,000
be submitting next year like what is the

394
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
research that you've had in the back

395
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,639
your mind

396
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,199
now whether it's through the digital

397
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,959
forensic discord server or just through

398
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,439
you know trading email addresses or

399
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,680
whatnot you got a whole lot of options

400
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,959
of how you're going to be able to think

401
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,319
that through and you're going to make

402
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,719
cool discoveries you're going to

403
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,279
whether it be some of our soft skills or

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,040
or you know more storytelling type of

405
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,839
of talks or whether you're talking about

406
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,839
really deep dive

407
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,560
artifact-based uh stuff there's so many

408
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
options

409
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,119
and there's a long time between now and

410
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,079
363 days from now for uh for research

411
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
and

412
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,279
uh development not just of content but

413
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,519
of

414
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
friendships and and colleagueships so

415
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,720
i'm hoping that of the people that are

416
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
attending here this week uh

417
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,399
that we we've got at least some of you

418
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
submitting for our cfps and it's not

419
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,959
just the dfir summit either

420
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,160
um our threat hunting summit which uh is

421
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
normally in

422
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,279
new orleans but it will be in uh

423
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,439
obviously virtual this year

424
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,279
we have closed that cfp but we have our

425
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,839
cyber threat intelligence summit coming

426
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
up

427
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,480
and those three deeper threat hunting

428
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
and cyber threat intelligence are the

429
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,639
three uh that are part of the uh the

430
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
dfir world

431
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,000
then we also have a variety of our other

432
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
summits we've got cloud we've got appsec

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,160
we've got pen test hack fest

434
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,360
sans is not just in the deeper world of

435
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,319
course but uh you know

436
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
find other places to other places to

437
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
talk

438
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,399
other places to uh to submit your

439
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,399
information i know we'd uh we'd love to

440
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,839
have you in whatever venue is best

441
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,199
suited to your material

442
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,120
can i compliment something that was

443
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,560
really neat this year that i hadn't seen

444
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
in previous years and maybe i

445
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,239
missed it i really like the concept of

446
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
these right size talks

447
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,000
not all talks for 30 minutes frank's

448
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,240
talk was a little bit shorter but it was

449
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
the right size for the content

450
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,760
and i think we're about to see that with

451
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,000
daryl's talk and i really um

452
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,040
think it was great that that that effort

453
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,760
was made to make

454
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,439
right size talks for the content so

455
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,439
people don't have to stretch or compress

456
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,399
that's something i've never seen before

457
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,920
it does make sense sometimes i think a

458
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,920
shorter talk is even harder

459
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,880
like what you talked me into for tf rws

460
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
20 minutes

461
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
17 minutes to like state your piece it's

462
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,880
difficult

463
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,399
it is i i actually it's one of the

464
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
things i like about osdf

465
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,000
because they do the lightning talks and

466
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
i've actually challenged myself

467
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
before to give talks that i have

468
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,720
hour-long talks for in five minutes

469
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
and it it's really a neat challenge to

470
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
try to take

471
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
the content and say what's the most

472
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,040
important information

473
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,399
i need to distill dfrws does the same

474
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
lightning talks as well

475
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,680
and and really get that content out

476
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,439
there quickly

477
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,920
it's actually really cool for to hear

478
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,800
about work people are doing as well

479
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,120
that's like new and novel yeah so i i

480
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,680
just

481
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,519
love this concept of right size talks

482
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,319
and it is so freaking challenging to

483
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,959
make a short talk

484
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,519
i agree and frank's storytelling the

485
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,560
perfect

486
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,199
10 minutes that was fantastic i'm

487
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,719
thinking of timing

488
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
i really have to give a hand to a lot of

489
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
the presenters who did co-presenting

490
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,439
because

491
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,199
a lot of people i don't know if you are

492
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,320
here in zoom and you run into these

493
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,959
issues but

494
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,880
because of the very slight delay knowing

495
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,638
when the right beat is

496
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,399
to when to transition over to the next

497
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
speaker you know if you notice on larger

498
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,920
zooms you tend to start talking and the

499
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,199
other person talks exactly the same time

500
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,199
and there's that two to three second

501
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,920
you're talking it over each other i

502
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,800
really was impressed and i was worried

503
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
about it

504
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,879
for the those that were co-presenting

505
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,520
over the past couple days

506
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,600
um whether or not that would happen or

507
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,240
you know but they clearly practiced

508
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,839
and they had really good handoff back

509
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,120
and forth between each other

510
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,958
you know the beats and everything that

511
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,678
we're set up you know i've been on zooms

512
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
where

513
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
it because of that half second delay and

514
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,438
the human eye

515
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,079
and here are looking for when is the

516
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,440
right

517
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,799
point to start talking again and people

518
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
tend to just continually

519
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,080
talk talk like i'm doing right now

520
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
because if you give a little bit of a

521
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
second

522
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,880
someone will start jumping right in but

523
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,559
the co-presenters nailed it and i was

524
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,320
for anyone who's watching right now

525
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,440
that's hard to do and everyone's been on

526
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,799
zoom in all these calls

527
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,480
so you know what i'm talking about the

528
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,240
the talking over each other thing

529
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
is sometimes really hard to to

530
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
strategize but all the co-presenters

531
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,399
really did

532
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
a good job on that you know i also would

533
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
like to say something that sans does

534
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,559
uniquely and people might not be aware

535
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,639
of this is every speaker no matter

536
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,000
how common you are of a speaker everyone

537
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
gets a mentor

538
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,120
and everyone works with their mentors to

539
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,280
ensure that their talk is developed

540
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,360
to not only have the right technical

541
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,360
pieces but be presented well

542
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,520
and i think that's really what makes us

543
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,918
the ted talks of forensics

544
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,480
so i think it's just really clever that

545
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
that element is brought in

546
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,600
i agree rob i wanted to share something

547
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
with you that came to me as a direct

548
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,120
message

549
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
so first of all i personally credit rob

550
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,760
lee to the reason the summit is free

551
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,760
so thank you rob but people are sending

552
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,360
messages saying they would have never

553
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,679
been able to get their organization to

554
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,320
pay for them to attend a conference

555
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
and the opportunity has been amazing so

556
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,080
thank you rob

557
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,439
well honestly the real credit goes to

558
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,480
the summit team um

559
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,840
i mean it was a combined decision we all

560
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,320
were talking about it

561
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,600
about the right thing you know between

562
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,799
brian jennifer

563
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,320
um you know management at sans uh the

564
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,480
everyone who was saying should we do it

565
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
you know with week after week of not

566
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,799
knowing when whether we're gonna go to

567
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
actual an in-person event or not

568
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,080
it was clear that this thing is gonna

569
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
hold on to the end of the summer now

570
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,399
it's you know maybe to the end of the

571
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
year

572
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,240
were in terms of are we going to go back

573
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,039
to any in-person events for like summits

574
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
that is

575
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,240
so there's this was this constant back

576
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
and forth and so

577
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
yeah i appreciate the credit but it's

578
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
actually all of sans is trying to take a

579
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,879
look at this

580
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
as a whole because they want to try and

581
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
figure out ways to

582
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
energize with the community and connect

583
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,039
with community um

584
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,720
and so you know between this one and

585
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,160
hack fest um

586
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,600
i was definitely on this camp of let's

587
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
go ahead and make it free but again i

588
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,559
think everyone's mindset was there

589
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
they just want to make sure that we're

590
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,039
doing it we're able to execute it's not

591
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
easy

592
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,400
to figure out how to do a zoom with 10

593
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
000 people in multiple rooms

594
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
and how to do youtube streaming uh we

595
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
have an individual behind the scenes his

596
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,480
name is brian corcoran a big shout out

597
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
to him

598
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
if he's

599
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,120
and falls down a set of stairs and is

600
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,159
not online i actually worry about the

601
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
event you know continuing forward um you

602
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
know he's one of

603
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,360
the massive i.t team that's behind it

604
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
but brian's idea is to be able to get

605
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,000
the youtube streaming and be able to get

606
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
some of this stuff set up

607
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,240
pretty quickly um you know huge hat tip

608
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,240
to him and his team

609
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,760
um that he leads um to make sure that

610
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
we're all stable and um

611
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,440
we somewhat look good on camera

612
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,879
yeah and even to extend that theme um

613
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
what a lot of our attendees don't

614
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,280
necessarily realize even at a live event

615
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,559
where

616
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,000
you're passing by these people

617
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,678
physically in the hallway not just

618
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,320
seeing names on discord

619
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,520
it's a massive team to put this kind of

620
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,080
an event on

621
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
um you know just from from uh brian

622
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,158
glenn

623
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,760
uh jen santiago and their entire team

624
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
uh whether it's answering questions in

625
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,280
discord uh kind of

626
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,240
curating questions here in zoom

627
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,918
or dealing with with screen issues uh

628
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,919
interfacing with brian and the rest of

629
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,480
his entire it team

630
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
is a massive massive undertaking um so

631
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
we

632
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
we greatly appreciate i cannot i cannot

633
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,158
even begin to state how much we

634
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,918
appreciate the excessive amount of work

635
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
that they put into making these things

636
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,200
work and

637
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,879
um you know we we do our best to try and

638
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
help but really the heavy lifting comes

639
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,799
from

640
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
behind the scenes just like any kind of

641
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,360
a production so don't uh

642
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
don't don't hesitate to reach out to our

643
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
team uh

644
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
corrigan who's been running a great

645
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,240
great discord

646
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
uh server for us for the whole time and

647
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,360
it's just been um

648
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,960
it's it's a massive effort so don't

649
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,399
overlook that

650
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
the other thing we ended up doing which

651
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,080
we tried for this one is that uh if you

652
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,679
go to the agenda

653
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
and it was hard to get this announced

654
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,000
but again i want everyone to go look at

655
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,918
that because it's

656
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
in there and it's really cool feature is

657
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
that you'll see a little calendar icon

658
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,120
if you click on that it books your

659
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,799
calendar because i know

660
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,559
as with most of us we still have other

661
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,760
things going on around us and unless you

662
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
block your calendar

663
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,039
it doesn't exist so he's like oh i'll

664
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,158
attend the summit and then

665
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,840
having to fill out your calendar um

666
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,919
being able to do that and there's one in

667
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
there too it's like block it all

668
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,200
and i like the universal one that was

669
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,559
created because every single track and

670
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,080
every single event was automatically

671
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
dropped on your calendar but if you

672
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,280
did want to say i want this talk or this

673
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,799
talk or that talk to make sure no one

674
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,399
else books your time

675
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,879
you know for another zoom or you know

676
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,200
normal work it was very useful and you

677
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
know

678
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
a big big credit goes to emily and uh

679
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,080
brian corcoran from being all to make

680
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,280
that happen

681
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,960
uh for the agenda take a look at the

682
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,480
agenda if you've not seen that you know

683
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,600
i i hope that's going to happen in

684
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,200
future events

685
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,799
uh for this especially the virtual so

686
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,080
you could you know be hot before the

687
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,840
event make sure

688
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
you're you're not going to accidentally

689
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,199
be brought into a you know 30 person

690
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,520
call for work and you can't get off of

691
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
it

692
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,080
and you prefer to be listening to uh uh

693
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,559
you know just garcia talked about you

694
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,879
know

695
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,080
uh machine learning and a bunch of other

696
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,799
cool things

697
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,559
yeah i do like the fact that also that

698
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,360
it was you registered for the whole

699
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,240
event

700
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,840
and then could pick your calendar items

701
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,600
sometimes conferences are the other way

702
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,360
where you have to then each register for

703
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,719
each unit in order to get those calendar

704
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,199
invites so it was actually a really

705
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
smart

706
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,320
way to have you register once

707
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,600
but yet have multiple separate calendar

708
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,840
invites and be able to choose the ones

709
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,840
you want

710
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
one other question and comment that i'm

711
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,320
a question and zoom comment in

712
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
discord i've got all over my screens

713
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,320
here that i see coming up a couple of

714
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,159
times now um

715
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,600
just about once again where the

716
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
materials are going to be

717
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
um question about is there a git repo of

718
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
the links um those are scattered pretty

719
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,039
well across the uh the materials so i

720
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,039
would say your best bet for

721
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,080
all of those online resources will be

722
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,840
the slides

723
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
that again are going to show up in that

724
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,678
that location it certainly is going to

725
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
help you with context as well because uh

726
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,159
you know i don't know

727
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,639
i don't know how old everybody is but i

728
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,159
remember way back in ancient history

729
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,279
before there were zeros at the end of

730
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,000
the year you know we used to trade

731
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:53,200
bookmarks.html and say these are

732
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,720
bookmarks and they had absolutely no

733
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
context it was just basically a great

734
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
big link farm

735
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
so getting the context that you can pull

736
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,520
is

737
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,199
something i think is really helpful as

738
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,879
well so that's why we make sure you have

739
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,320
that material and then of course

740
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
uh the video recordings that are

741
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,799
available as well that get pushed to

742
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,639
youtube

743
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,918
and to kind of look back toward some

744
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,000
point in the future whenever we do

745
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,120
return to live like what that's going to

746
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,720
uh to look like

747
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,840
we've done video recordings high grade

748
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
hd professional video recordings of our

749
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,199
speakers

750
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,080
for uh for a number of years and that's

751
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
also largely

752
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,559
you know i know he doesn't want me to

753
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
say this but that's largely to rob's

754
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,279
credit as well um you know getting that

755
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,360
to happen

756
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,279
which becomes a big benefit to our

757
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,479
speakers because this becomes something

758
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,640
you can put into

759
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
their uh their portfolio if you will of

760
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,600
things they've spoken about publicly

761
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,960
at a big event and it's also a way that

762
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,719
um

763
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,039
your colleagues and you know into the

764
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,559
future people can refer back to the work

765
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,080
that you've done without having to say i

766
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,520
gave a talk three years ago it was cool

767
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,199
but you weren't there

768
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,240
um i routinely point my students

769
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,760
to a you know

770
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,279
any number of videos from previous

771
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,799
summits saying oh if you'd like

772
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
to know about how to integrate your

773
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,039
tools into

774
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,960
your your forensic analysis workflow go

775
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,400
to this url and look at mary degrassi's

776
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,400
talk because she did this a couple years

777
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
ago it's amazing um you know if you want

778
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
to learn about moloch go to this one

779
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,080
from last year's

780
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,360
talk so to be honest i use them all the

781
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,559
time as required

782
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,918
viewing for graduate courses i teach

783
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,080
right and i know i'm not the only

784
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
instructor who does it uh you know to be

785
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,199
honest heather your body drag

786
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,200
fitness talk with sarah edwards that is

787
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,840
a must view in my syllabus

788
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
so there are some great uh amazing

789
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,879
content that's been out there

790
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
and one of the reasons it can be so

791
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,039
referenceable is because of

792
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
the quality of the talks and actually

793
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
the quality of the recordings makes a

794
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,159
big difference though that

795
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,279
that they're actually well done easy to

796
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,799
understand and very very clear

797
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,799
that's the same with your alexa are you

798
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,039
skynet i still reference that all the

799
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,039
time

800
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,760
and we're glad to provide that too um

801
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,639
because we've got a you know we got a

802
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,559
ton of

803
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
free resources that we're able to

804
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,360
provide too so a question that uh just

805
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,480
came in on

806
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,240
um for your special access to documents

807
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,440
or other basic lectures

808
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
the sans webinar series is extensive and

809
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
we have

810
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,919
i know we've got hundreds of them i

811
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,879
don't even know how many you know in

812
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,640
total but

813
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,000
we've got those going across not just

814
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,480
forensics but of course

815
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,039
the entire spectrum of what sans is here

816
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,360
to

817
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,400
to do so we've got those as resources

818
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,840
we've got posters

819
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
cheat sheets all available as pdfs to

820
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,120
download

821
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,240
we also have virtual machines that you

822
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,639
can use that are

823
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,559
full processing systems you know the

824
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
sift workstation

825
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,678
it's been around for a while and

826
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,240
continuously

827
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,600
reinvested into when i was doing

828
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
forensic processing for

829
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,959
a lot of my law enforcement work that

830
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,039
was my only forensic platform

831
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
that was it that's all i needed it had

832
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,000
everything i needed in order to do that

833
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,240
job so

834
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,240
don't think that this is an academic use

835
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,039
only you know sift has been

836
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,559
a game changer in terms of the appliance

837
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,799
approach that we take to a lot of these

838
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,000
machines where we build this entire

839
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,039
lab in a vmdk file and then you're able

840
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,880
to boot and use that

841
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,919
so in terms of free resources don't

842
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,279
hesitate to go to sans.org

843
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,919
free and it's a continuously evolving

844
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,520
list of

845
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
the variety of resources that we have

846
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,200
there so when someone asks if there's a

847
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,600
sift 4 coming out and

848
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,440
the answer is no we do have 20.04

849
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,879
support being released sift has become

850
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,919
more like security onion we just update

851
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,080
the packages

852
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,399
and it you just update and at that point

853
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
but 20.04 lts support is about to be

854
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,399
dropped

855
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,120
we're about there um but uh we have

856
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,639
python python uh python three python two

857
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,000
we have to do a lot of testing just to

858
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
make sure we don't have to deprecate any

859
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,480
tools out

860
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,439
i love this channel i could just watch

861
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
it all day

862
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,000
and it looks like screaming by you know

863
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,520
i would not survive i have another

864
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,360
monitor you know but again it's off to

865
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
the side here and that's my head turned

866
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,120
to like do this to make sure i could see

867
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,480
both at the same time

868
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,399
we also have uh some new things we're

869
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,880
doing uh phil uh

870
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,918
we're doing every other week during um

871
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
actually i think this is gonna we're

872
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,279
gonna continue doing this for a while

873
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,120
we have a lot of our labs now in the

874
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
cloud and as a result of

875
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,279
uh being able to do that we're doing

876
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,480
tech tuesdays workshops uh every other

877
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,720
week look for it um

878
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
on the sands website but basically it's

879
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,520
authors coming up with actual instead of

880
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,159
just a webcast

881
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,679
we're doing labs it's a you know 30

882
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,159
minutes of a here's what you're about to

883
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,760
do

884
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,399
and then the other hour and a half is a

885
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,279
full up lab environment so if anyone's

886
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,360
never experienced uh live online in the

887
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,480
way sans does between the slack channel

888
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,240
and the presentation it's a free thing

889
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,760
that you're gonna go learn a skill

890
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,520
the master of it though and i know he's

891
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,440
listening right now is mark

892
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,799
baggett with his python one he did one

893
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
earlier this week um

894
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,080
he did one a month ago too and i

895
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,520
guarantee

896
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,520
he's already lining up another one

897
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,320
because it is amazing

898
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,760
watching him walk through um you know

899
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,240
through the lab environment

900
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,399
he has a bunch of slack bots you know

901
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,520
and he's doing it with a thousand

902
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,199
students simultaneously um it's just

903
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,879
it's mind-blowing um but again we're

904
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,960
doing those about once every two weeks

905
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
uh heather you're doing one up here we

906
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
are i think

907
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,678
like august it's right around the time

908
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,360
i'm doing the summer camp

909
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,320
for lee whitfield lee and i are doing

910
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,719
one the other lee oh my gosh

911
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,840
yes so we are doing one and you know

912
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
what mark baggett

913
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,439
he has a special skill i'm not kidding

914
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,440
he did my lunch show the control

915
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,960
delete thing and i'm not kidding my face

916
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,880
was like this close to the screen the

917
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,080
whole time he brought up

918
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,440
just python and it was all music trivia

919
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,120
it was awesome like you should have seen

920
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,559
the missy elliott one

921
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,840
it was amazing it was mind-blowingly

922
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,158
amazing

923
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,360
so thank you mark you are brilliant i

924
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,840
think it's great that you're doing that

925
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
too

926
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,279
uh for another reason because it's hard

927
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,639
for people to sometimes express

928
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,320
or know if they're going to be

929
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,320
successful in that

930
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,840
online platform environment so being

931
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,000
able to get that little

932
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,120
snippet of it that test in that short

933
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
time period

934
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,039
gives you the confidence that you can

935
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,200
succeed in that environment and honestly

936
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,480
you can use that to justify

937
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,080
to your employer if you're going to be

938
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,840
successful in that environment yeah i

939
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,320
think those little tests are valuable

940
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,000
that's a great point and for the 585 one

941
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,639
that lee krugnelly and i are going to be

942
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
doing

943
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,480
it's going to be on testing and

944
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
validation which just you and i

945
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
stand on this platform like crazy people

946
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,159
but

947
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,520
how to create test app data and how to

948
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,480
verify it so we're going to teach you

949
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,918
what do we have rob

950
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,399
i always say it's like four hours is it

951
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,399
two hours

952
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:54,799
the the um test classes

953
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,158
it's two hours i'm always usually

954
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
thought four hours and then we're like

955
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,039
wow that's a long time

956
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,919
yeah there's a lot of helpers that are

957
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,480
have to engage

958
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,200
so uh we did one that was longer and i

959
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,159
think we almo

960
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,519
almost died so we're trying we're like

961
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,720
okay let's shoot for two hours it ended

962
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,399
up being the right time uh

963
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,080
timing to be able to do it i think

964
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,918
that's easier for people to talk

965
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,840
here for where to look for everyone to

966
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,279
see this i'll pin it quickly too two

967
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,840
hours is the perfect time for someone to

968
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,720
fit that still into a full work day

969
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,399
and be able to test that value and still

970
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,080
gain knowledge and heather

971
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,840
i can't wait to see the dates for that

972
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,000
one because you know i am the biggest

973
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,559
supporter of testing and validation

974
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
uh for especially in mobile like i think

975
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,000
it's like the week of august

976
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,279
12th or something i'm pretty sure i have

977
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,519
to look at my schedule but i'll let you

978
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,120
know for sure when it is

979
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,799
it will be good and you know what it's

980
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,080
also a good opportunity

981
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,158
to hear people that i think

982
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,439
some of us speak differently to others

983
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,360
and some people i know

984
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,960
would think i could never have heather

985
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,158
talk to me for six days straight she

986
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,279
would drive me crazy

987
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,440
and then you would take the class with

988
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,399
like matia or terry mcguire or lee or

989
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,080
someone else

990
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,918
but it's true and rob i think when i was

991
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,158
ready to take 508 you were like take it

992
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,320
with eric zimmerman i know that he

993
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,840
will resonate with you so it's always i

994
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,000
ended up taking a chat and eric is

995
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,639
probably still mad at me for this but

996
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,640
i'm finally going to take 498 with eric

997
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,320
in august finally i will have him as an

998
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,679
instructor but you know what i mean some

999
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,879
people i feel like just speak your

1000
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,120
language

1001
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,559
if that makes sense to you and i've had

1002
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,080
it's ironic i have a lot of law

1003
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,600
enforcement when i teach 500 they're

1004
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,799
like wow

1005
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,840
you speak my language i was like okay i

1006
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,039
like it i don't really know what that

1007
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,080
means because i've never been law

1008
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
enforcement but

1009
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,000
sweet and that's really interesting

1010
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,360
though because there's such a variety of

1011
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,640
instructors

1012
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,158
and they all have different backgrounds

1013
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,320
and different styles but they

1014
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,519
all are such quality and you know that

1015
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
the material

1016
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,799
is all going to be hit but it's what

1017
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,199
resonates with you

1018
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,039
and like i specifically intentionally

1019
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,840
took 4 500 with david cowan

1020
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,679
because i knew he was the person who i

1021
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,760
wanted to take that course from

1022
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,440
and i think marrying those things up so

1023
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
that you know what's going to fit for

1024
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,240
you

1025
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,519
is is such an important thing and one of

1026
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
the things that you get with sans is

1027
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,360
there's so many

1028
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,960
of those um free talk seminars

1029
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,719
at night events etc where you can

1030
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,600
actually test out

1031
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,960
how you feel an instructor speaks talks

1032
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,600
their rhythm the way that

1033
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,360
they um because of their experience

1034
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,639
where their analogies lie and if they're

1035
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,120
going to resonate with you so

1036
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,320
that's really great and we have a lot of

1037
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,320
friends in the community too

1038
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,519
you know jessica i mean what is it next

1039
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,600
week or the week after

1040
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,120
dfrws is connected next week starting

1041
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,158
monday yeah

1042
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,479
you know and we have a lot of

1043
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,480
instructors that you know are doing both

1044
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,240
and you know we actively encourage that

1045
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,120
you know we we try to be good stewards

1046
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,279
in the community

1047
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,879
sans is you know we look at everyone out

1048
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,320
there black hills information security's

1049
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,760
doing a bunch of stuff to

1050
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
you know keep you know things rolling

1051
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,879
but you know big hat tip to all the

1052
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,799
organizations out there

1053
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,880
um that are you know really trying to

1054
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,960
continually engage with the community

1055
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
um during cover times and it's not easy

1056
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,080
but i appreciate it all

1057
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,720
likewise we reach out to instructors

1058
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,840
both keynotes that dfrws are science

1059
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,520
instructors this year

1060
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,520
so the two keynotes are david cowan and

1061
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,599
mary degrazia uh so

1062
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
can't can't beat that heather's giving a

1063
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,280
talk and

1064
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,079
it's also really a different event and

1065
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,520
it's kind of neat

1066
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,599
because it's not like the sandstor

1067
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,159
summit i would say one of and daryl fife

1068
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,760
uh will be speaking uh and running the

1069
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,119
lightning talks but what's really

1070
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,639
different about it

1071
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,560
is that it's the intersection of

1072
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,879
academian practitioners so there's a lot

1073
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,799
of

1074
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,399
technical peer-reviewed papers so

1075
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,599
completely different event if you're

1076
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,598
interested in that check it out

1077
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,000
now it's been great

1078
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,119
the discord is it's like a scroll

1079
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,359
it's flowing so fast i can't i can't

1080
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,119
follow it it's too quick

1081
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,199
it's like a youtube channel during news

1082
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,960
stories like when they go

1083
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,439
yeah some people are posting in there

1084
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,640
i'm curious who is taking

1085
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:06,720
308 it's the beta

1086
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,319
next week digital forensics essentials

1087

1088
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,240
about it brand new

1089
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,480

1090
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,520

1091
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,280
it's coming tell me about it yes hey rob

1092
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,720
um we're just about at the point where

1093
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,720
we're supposed to go to break but um

1094
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,640
confidential source number 17

1095
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,480
uh just provided me with something that

1096
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,440
i think i need to share with everybody

1097
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,440
but i i think it's funny for for us but

1098
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,560
it's also interesting to show how

1099
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
as we've been talking about like

1100
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,799
cultivating relationships within this

1101
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
community

1102
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,160
and the fact that you're going to be

1103
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,440
re-running into the same people for your

1104
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,960
entire career

1105
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,599
is uh is is something that you

1106
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,359
definitely will uh will will want to be

1107
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,880
aware of you're going to make those

1108
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,078
relationships work

1109
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,839
i'm going to go ahead and do this just

1110
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,079
before we go ahead and take a quick

1111
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,078
break

1112
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,359
is this a wait for it wait for it moment

1113

it is just for everybody's knowledge but

1126
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,760
that looks like it's taken in the 70s

1127
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,359
that's because it's all fuzzy it's one
