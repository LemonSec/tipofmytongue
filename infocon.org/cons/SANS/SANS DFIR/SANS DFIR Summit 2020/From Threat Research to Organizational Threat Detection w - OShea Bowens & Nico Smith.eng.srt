[Music]

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,119
i had an opportunity to

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
first virtually meet o'shea uh jesus i

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,560
wanna say it was a couple of weeks ago

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
but i have no concept of time anymore

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,680
um where there's a twitter campaign

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,038
called share the mic in cyber

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,800
uh where they basically paired

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
people up uh who are established

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,200
practitioners in the field

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,960
um with people who are newer and newer

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
not new but newer in their career people

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,239
of

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
uh color and i got to great opportunity

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,199
to meet o'shea and learn about his

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,680
pathway into

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
the cyber security industry and learn a

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,320
lot about the great work that he's been

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,760
doing and the research and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
some of the other community support and

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,160
stuff it's been a real cool time and

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,719
we've been able to exchange quite a bit

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
of information and stories since then

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,800
and i realized it was a great

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
opportunity

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,239
um to to bring him here for this talk as

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,480
well

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,519
so uh you know i'm glad to have you out

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,600
the chance to do that

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,360
and uh this material is really really

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
cool he's gonna be talking along with

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,520
with aniko smith who i just

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
met what like two two three days ago

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,920
face to face you know aside from email

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,960
face to face being over zoom of course

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,799
um

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
and uh and they're gonna be talking on

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,680
this kind of like point counterpoint

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
regarding how threat detection

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,600
pairs up with threat research and vice

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
versa so it's going to kind of be a red

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,559
blue

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,158
point counterpoint which i think is

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
really important for us from a dfir

45
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
world because we're going to be in a

46
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,759
position

47
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
to eventually investigate the

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,079
operational

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,360
use of red techniques and knowing how

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,639
they look when they're developed is

51
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,720
going to help us be better at that from

52
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,040
an artifact perspective

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,320
so that all being said um i will turn

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000

90
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,760
different areas breaking down uh

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
uh research all the way back into uh

92
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
detection uh

93
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,079
after the intros and then if we have

94
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,319
time which we should we'll take some

95

association thank you niko busy man

122
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,360
awesome so so what what brought us here

123
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,560
um one of the areas that uh i spend most

124
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,000
of my time in i've been in this about

125
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
like almost like 10 years and majority

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
of my life has been in the in security

127
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
operations

128
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,519
and at times uh mostly mostly post-red

129
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
team engagements we begin to ask

130
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,640
questions around how can we actually

131
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,320
formulate uh

132
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,238
more of those exercises build those for

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,719
ourselves and learn how we can actually

134
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
properly

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
appropriately test and bet our own

136
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,320
defenses

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
uh but over the last year or so i've

138
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,599
been thinking more about this like how

139
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,960
to make this into like a formal process

140
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
uh we really had to share this with the

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,198
community so this is one of the first

142
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
attempts of sharing it with the

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
community

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,280
uh so moving from you know creating the

145
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,960
attack to

146
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,638
focusing on how to build out detection

147
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,919
to reporting but also

148
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
ensuring that it's something that's

149
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
familiar right so what's familiar that

150
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,800
we can rope into that

151
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
uh well that's attack miter and we'll

152
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,560
dive into that uh

153
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,840
a bit later but from the research

154
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
perspective i think one of the bigger

155
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
things to think about is

156
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,080
you know from start to finish what does

157
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
it take to get me there

158
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,758
when you're working in a sock or you're

159
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,199
working within a security team

160
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
and you don't have that red teaming

161
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
experience uh it's a hole right you know

162
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
a lot of the red teams typically don't

163
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
you don't find them in full-time

164
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
positions working necessarily hand in

165
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,559
hand with the individuals on the on the

166
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,159
defensive side of things

167
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
uh so you have to kind of get creative

168
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,639
and start learning these things yourself

169
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
unless you're one of the lucky few that

170
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
have a red team

171
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,479
involved but as you're beginning to uh

172
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,479
to build this out you know the key

173
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,840
things to think about are you know

174
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,758
what am i protecting within my

175
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,280
environment do i understand the entirety

176
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,800
of the scope within my environment do i

177
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,599
understand the tech stack within my

178
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
environment

179
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
and how can i begin to target that in a

180
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
productive manner you know it's not

181
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
about owning boxes

182
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
it's really about understanding you know

183
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
what can i do to satisfy management

184
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,239
executive management you know

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
my csos worries about security you know

186
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
what's keeping them up at night

187
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
and what can i do in my day-to-day to

188
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039
help satisfy that

189
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
and depending on where you're actually

190
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,479
working uh the answer could differ

191
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,840
i uh i do not mean to do that

192
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,840
oh the answer can totally differ

193
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,758
depending on where you're working um so

194
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,679
if you're in a regulated uh field

195
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
uh maybe you're you have compliance

196
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
around pc

197
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,080
uh pci or you're in socks one sox two

198
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,720
you have hipaa

199
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
whatever it may be uh i think there's

200
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,240
areas

201
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,840
of information you can draw from to to

202
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,759
help get you there

203
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
so think about from the uh a piece of

204
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
pci perspective

205
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,479
with 10 and 12 you understand you know

206
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,680
what your security controls actually

207
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,400
are what your uh primary critical assets

208
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,600
are

209
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,120
and they make this super easy for you

210
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
because you have to do it or you could

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
deem right

212
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,318
so you're drawing from what you know is

213
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
within your environment and what your

214
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
tool sets

215
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,719
look like to begin to move move your

216
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
hypothesis to the right

217
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
of actually beginning to test and verify

218
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,638
where your how your defenses stack up

219
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
against attacks against those those

220
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
critical areas like niko i know you do a

221
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,360
bit of this so that does

222
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
i mean how does this work in your world

223
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
absolutely uh like you said a little bit

224
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
earlier

225
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,800
about um looking and and making sure

226
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,960
that there's a good marriage between

227
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,120
your blue and red space operations

228
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,638
uh on a few of my pen tests i was asked

229
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,680
to uh kind of target

230
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,479
uh pcid uh dss type of uh

231
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
card holder data flow uh in order to

232
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,199
test for x field capabilities and

233
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
and trying to ensure that uh that the

234
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
organization as a whole

235
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,160
uh could return back to healthy as soon

236
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
as possible

237
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,199
yeah and it's a it's a funny area right

238
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
i love what i've done with my uh my

239
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,599
professional careers i've i've been

240
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
mostly blue team

241
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,560
uh mostly on the cyber defense

242
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,758
operations side and i've been

243
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,440
incorporating more red team and

244
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,599
application security to really learn

245
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,039
more of where the industry's going i

246
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,639
think you know it's shifting from

247
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,479
you know it was you know five ten years

248
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,199
ago it was only like ids

249
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,039
or it was you know uh primarily the

250
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,599
source of your operations was like a sim

251
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,120
you know but now you have you know cicd

252
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,878
you have pipelines you have

253
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
more applications that are being thrown

254
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,759
out from a web app perspective you have

255
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,199
seoc so there's so much more you can

256
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
take in as a defender

257
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
uh and learn that can put you in an

258
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,759
awesome position and when you begin to

259
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,120
think about from a thread modeling

260
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,840
perspective you know you're likely gonna

261
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
find yourself

262
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,318
you know with your google foo you're

263
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,680
likely going to come to the two

264
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
frameworks that are fairly

265
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,599
common and fairly and most widely

266
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
adopted uh within the industry and

267
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,319
that's uh microsoft

268
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,120
microsoft stride uh framework and pasta

269
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
framework

270
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,039
and the difference between these aren't

271
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,000
necessarily night and day it's more like

272
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,159
you know

273
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,520
uh four o'clock versus like six o'clock

274
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
you know right before a dust sets in

275
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,039
right it's not totally night and day but

276
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
you can adopt from either one of these

277
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,639
you know one's more risk centric

278
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
the other one's more system citric uh

279
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,440
but i think for what we're what we what

280
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
we're going to be walking through

281
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,919
you can think along the lines of like

282
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,199
pasta because we're going to actually

283
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,199
attempt to build out

284
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,959
of the processee and walk through the

285
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,599
actual attack uh which is what i

286
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
recommend

287
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,640
uh anytime you actually run through

288
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,478
these type of engagements internally

289
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
uh build out the attack see where you

290
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
stack up understand your weaknesses

291
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,560
really understand your defenses uh as a

292
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
defender i take pride in understanding

293
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,640
that i can look at the first two octets

294
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,000
uh of an address that fires within our

295
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
environment and i know exactly where

296
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,279
that is right like i i i pride myself on

297
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
understanding

298
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,040
what our tech sect looks like if

299
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,880
something pops up but for as a new cve

300
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,640
or like say take that the the windows

301
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
dns vulnerability i kind of understood

302
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
immediately like hey this affects us in

303
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
this manner because i know like what our

304
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
environment looks like

305
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,560
as you're moving down this stage and

306
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,920
you're when you're working towards your

307
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,518
goal for threat modeling i think this is

308
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,120
a really awesome representation of what

309
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
your end goal should look like

310
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
i will say at times it's not totally

311
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,920
realistic um

312
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
you know if you if you happen to be

313
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
buddies with that you work with

314
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,240
individuals or of

315
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,000
security architects you know they're

316
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,120
great for this type of work to map

317
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,440
out controls to map out processes and to

318
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
map

319
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
out you know what the attacker may

320
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,640
attempt to touch or target or

321
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
or how you can actually track them in

322
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,240
your environment but it's super hard

323
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,680
um we will not be building this but it

324
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
is very hard to get to this point where

325
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,599
you've established you know your trust

326
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,199
boundaries

327
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
you know your ingress and egress flows

328
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
and those are are clarified and those

329
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,560
are representative on this

330
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
on the document that you that you keep

331
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
internally uh i love

332
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
threat modeling exercises especially

333
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,439
around application security because i

334
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,120
think

335
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
well i like to say like i don't like to

336
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,600
say but in my reality i'm not an abstech

337
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,279
individual

338
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
uh so i kind of suck at it but i've

339
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,480
loved over the last year and a half

340
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
learn as much as i can on application

341
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
security

342
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
because i honestly feel like it's helped

343
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
me become a much better a much better

344
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,199
defender

345
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,480
and walking through uh application of

346
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,760
threat models isn't too dissimilar from

347
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,519
building out a threat model for the

348
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,800
entirety of your org it's the

349
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,320
i mean the primary difference is you're

350
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,439
thinking more externally facing when

351
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,720
you're thinking about the in

352
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,880
the entire threat model of your

353
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
organization versus internal functions

354
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,560
for the uh from

355
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,760
app from absec perspective um but if you

356
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,000
can get to a point like this and you can

357
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
pay

358
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
for it great uh what we're gonna focus

359
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
on is something a bit different

360
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,839
um and as you're moving towards meeting

361
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,279
these goals you know you know don't uh

362
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,399
what i advise people when i consult with

363
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
different clients like you don't get

364
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,640
discouraged when you're attempting to

365
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
build something out

366
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
and it falls over or you or you trip

367
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
over right some log sources aren't going

368
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,279
to be available

369
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,040
maybe the data isn't clean there's a

370
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
strong chance that the network diagram

371
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
you get

372
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
is going to be four or five years old

373
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
right and when you ask them for a new

374
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
one

375
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
uh don't expect that within the next 24

376
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
hours you know it may take them a couple

377
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,760
of weeks

378
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
but uh but begin to kind of mentally

379
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,399
build up that resilience as you're

380
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
moving down this process

381
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
i know in the times that i've begun to

382
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,399
incorporate this within an organization

383
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,319
it's not start to finish you know 72

384
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
hours um it's usually something along

385
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,720
the lines of i receive

386
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,040
a network diagram or maybe i receive an

387
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,279
if i'm lucky i get an asset inventory

388
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,480
that's up to date and that's super lucky

389
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,240
uh i kind of base

390
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
moving this process upon under having a

391
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,360
network diagram first because that seems

392
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
a lot more realistic in regards to what

393
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,120
you're going to receive

394
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,880
from your peers and from your resources

395
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
but taking that network diagram

396
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
uh you know great it's great to

397
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,760
understand like where the vlans are

398
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,199
uh where your ingress and egress points

399
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
are but you need to move a bit you need

400
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
to

401
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,880
get it get a bit deeper right you need

402
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
to really understand what os's

403
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,800
are actually operating on those systems

404
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
you know if we have uh network devices

405
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
are those cisco's

406
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,760
uh those junipers you know we do netgear

407
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,760
whatever it may be netgear you're

408
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,200
probably in a lot of trouble but if it's

409
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,279
negative you know where

410
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
uh what version you're running on what

411
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,439
vulnerabilities are out there and it's

412
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
great to have this

413
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
have this kind of documented but we need

414
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,240
to go a bit further right so let's put

415
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,239
on our

416
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
you know adventurous hats and start

417
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
banging this out

418
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
the ultimate goal essentially is

419
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,119
building something like this and keeping

420
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,479
this internal

421
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,480
uh these are essentially what i like to

422
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,320
call like threat model cards uh

423
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
i kind of took the idea from thread

424
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
actor cards i've done a bit of

425
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,360
consulting in the past and

426
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,800
when i've worked with uh organizations

427
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
that may have suffered a breach and i

428
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
was called in to kind of help clean

429
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
things up

430
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
either as a as like a secondary incident

431
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
responder or someone who helped build

432
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,319
out

433
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
and strengthen the security operations

434
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,079
program

435
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,440
uh i began i began to see some of the

436
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,880
big bends like a crosstrack and things

437
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
like that like these thread actor cards

438
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
that

439
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
you can you know that they give you

440
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
alongside with the intel that you're

441
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,120
ingesting

442
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,399
uh then something i thought was cool was

443
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,320
like yeah that'd be awesome if you could

444
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,279
build these out kind of like

445
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,399
uh like a deck of cards right uh so

446
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,519
instead of just having the thread actor

447
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,839
card that lists out

448
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,680
their capabilities their known targets i

449
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,680
i'm thinking of you know why

450
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
why not create their model cards and

451
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
keep those internally

452
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,240
and catalog those uh but you may be

453
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,959
asking like well why the heck would i do

454
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
that okay

455
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
i will tell you why so if you begin to

456
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
think about

457
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
you know your time to detection and time

458
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,560
to remediate

459
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,839
and uh the effort it takes to train new

460
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,359
analysts

461
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,200
or engineers or bring more into the

462
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,279
responders into into uh

463
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
into the fold you know what it what's

464
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,560
the what's like the one barrier that

465
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,479
never really changes it's time

466
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
that that that kind of sucks us all it

467
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
makes us all a victim right like we're

468
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,800
all a victim of time

469
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,439
and and my thinking is always you know

470
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,639
how can i shrink uh shorten the time

471
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,839
uh to get to an answer having uh

472
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,800
something like a threat model car that

473
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
you and we'll walk through

474
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,839
an example this would have like a threat

475
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,239
model card where you can actually look

476
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,360
back

477
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,920
uh and quarry against a host name

478
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,680
or an ip and you're presented with

479
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,279
information along the lines of

480
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,519
hey we know what the trust boundaries

481
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,920
are for this segment of the network

482
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
as as as it relates to where that

483
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
specific host

484
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,319
lives we understand the different attack

485
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,479
techniques that are leveraged

486
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,079
uh that are that that particular system

487
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
may be susceptible to

488
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
because we've walked through attack

489
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,800
miter and

490
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
very slowly attack might receive we'll

491
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,959
go into that but walk through it very

492
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,199
slowly

493
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
and begin to identify specific uh

494
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,160
techniques

495
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
that are applicable to our environment

496
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,120
uh and from there we walk these

497
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,279
uh scenarios where we're taking things

498
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,560
like from maybe from a rec canary or

499
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,680
something along those lines

500
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,319
or of automatic uh of

501
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,199
emulation of maybe it's c2 or something

502
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
along those lines you know there's

503
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
different uh

504
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,599
attack relations you can run within your

505
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,479
environment but we're taking some of

506
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,560
those steps

507
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
and recreating those against our systems

508
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,279
and we're documenting the outcome so at

509
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
any given time

510
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
i've been alerted with a fire for my web

511
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
for my web app

512
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,079
for my uh my app my apache box i could

513
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,199
say hey i know what that host name is

514
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,800
let's look this up

515
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,560
okay here's a thread actor uh here's the

516
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,839
threat model card associated with it

517
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,760
here are all the things that we've

518
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,680
tested and

519
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,120
where we believe uh the vulnerabilities

520
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,040
may exist from

521
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,639
an actionable perspective right when i

522
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
say accidental i mean i can

523
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,320
view the log sources i can pull down the

524
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,480
quarries that i need

525
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,160
from you know whether that's cabana

526
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,760
splunk diva devo whatever whatever it is

527
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
you're using for a law correlator

528
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,959
you find a way to add that information

529
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,519
into uh

530
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,000
into into your cards but also ensure

531
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,160
that

532
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,440
uh as we'll go into it in a few minutes

533
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,240
you have that information readily

534
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,040
available

535
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
uh when leveraging attack miter uh if

536
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,839
you know i think

537
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,599
the majority of people that are

538
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
attending this uh conference from around

539
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
the world

540
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,440
uh likely have an idea what attack

541
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,480
matter is uh

542
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,880
then i won't go too deep into it but i

543
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,399
will say huge thanks to the people

544
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
at mitre for putting this together like

545
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
i've been a fan for the last like four

546
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,199
or five years with this

547
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,719
uh and sub techniques just came out so

548
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,319
like people have been waiting on that

549
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,240
for like a year or so so uh

550
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,480
like that's super cool uh but leveraging

551
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,120
attack mario was essentially a framework

552
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,800
of known attack uh don't attack uh

553
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,320
characteristics and types that

554
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,240
uh threat actors would use uh across

555
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
many different vectors miter collects

556
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
that and packages

557
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
packages it just packages is up for us

558
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,079
in a very very

559
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,839
clean fashion that we can use so let's

560
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,439
kind of walk through this right so

561
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,720
we're going back to understanding okay

562
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
well we want to build out threat model

563
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,959
card

564
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,399
let's take something within our

565
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,920
environment uh

566
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,440
and and begin to actually run through

567
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,680
this from start to finish so

568
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,079
for this example we're going to take uh

569
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
uh an application that's currently in qa

570
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,000
uh it hasn't been pushed approach yet uh

571
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,359
so you know and we want to test it we

572
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
want to understand you know

573
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
where the volume where the

574
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,758
vulnerabilities exist within this and we

575
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,719
also want to understand how we actually

576
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,880
attribute it to like our threat model

577
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,079
uh does this stuff happen yeah uh in a

578
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,560
sense it does you know the

579
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,839
the one challenge i've seen uh is at

580
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,439
times you may have the team that's

581
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,600
responsible for the abstract side

582
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,279
totally separate from the individuals on

583
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,120
the uh on the on the cyber defense

584
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
operation shot or on the cyber security

585
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
side

586
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,279
um so there is kind of a variance in

587
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
communications that may occur

588
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,120
but majority of the time you know uh it

589
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,000
is realistic you may not be totally

590
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
involved with the process

591
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
but this does happen right uh at some

592
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
point the application must be tested

593
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,520
um so i recommend you know as a security

594
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,438
operator throwing yourself

595
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,639
into you know raising your hand

596
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,679
volunteering to help out

597
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,600
if you don't have a dev uh a sec ops i

598
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
mean a sec a street applications team

599
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,559
maybe taking that initiative and sit

600
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
down with your developers understand

601
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,079
what the heck they're up to

602
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,520
i say jump in front of the problem

603
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
rather than later because it can save

604
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,879
you loads of time

605
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
um and what so what's wrong with this

606
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
application well we don't know yet

607
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,240
you know uh how are we going to reach uh

608
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
some type of uh conclusion and obtain

609
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
some type of data

610
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
uh well we're gonna have to test it how

611
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,840
do you test from a webinar perspective

612
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,840
whether it's either gonna be static

613
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,039
or dynamic uh and we'll walk through

614
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,439
both examples so

615
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,200
here we've taken a quick scan uh the

616
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,280
application yao which is the at

617
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,440
the app that's in qa that we that we

618
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,760
like to create the threat model card for

619
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,120
uh and you know right off the bat we see

620
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,799
sql injections

621
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
good well not good because you know that

622
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,639
can be leveraged against us but it's

623
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,159
good

624
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
to know we're on track and we're

625
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
actually obtaining uh

626
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
uh results um we go into dynamic and

627
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
there's many open source tools that you

628
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,559
can leverage with this uh i would say go

629
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,280
check out the os catalog

630
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,240
oas has an amazing uh amount of

631
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,639
references

632
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,760
uh and tools out there uh varico does

633
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,000
some really cool stuff it's a little bit

634
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
more expensive but you know you know

635
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,039
stay within your your budget and your

636
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
will house but from a dynamic

637
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,039
perspective we're looking at okay well

638
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,919
great we have php injection uh boom

639
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
let's go ahead and

640
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,280
move on down there and now we've taken

641
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,199
everything from the research side

642
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,559
and we're going towards implementing uh

643
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,360
the implementation

644
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,440
side with attack from the implementation

645
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,719
side you know you have to put on the

646
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,480
the attacker hat right like we're

647
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,919
thinking what would an attacker do with

648
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
in our environment or how would we

649
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,799
actually unders how can we begin to

650
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
understand their actual movement

651
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,000
you don't know that until you try so

652
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
from an upset perspective

653
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,039
uh you know you're thinking great i just

654
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,600
identified these vulnerabilities that

655
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,240
exist

656
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,678
so now it's time for me to actually to

657
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,679
prove it right i need to drop some type

658
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,000
of payload there or something that calls

659
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,919
back

660
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
out a calls out of the environment i

661
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,039
need some type of backdoor and i want to

662
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
exfil data

663
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
if i can accomplish those things and

664
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
understand where the defensive artifacts

665
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,120
are that

666
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,760
that helps us from a security operations

667
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,520
perspective all the better

668
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,919
uh and moving from identification super

669
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,080
simple stop right just a a

670
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,280
a quick printout of the php that's

671
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,360
available and

672
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,879
one big thing that stands out should be

673
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,879
you know the input validation doesn't

674
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,080
exist it accepts a file and php but it

675
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
doesn't actually have

676
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,199
any uh validation there so who knows

677
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,840
what you can throw up

678
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,760
uh could that be a pdf could that be exe

679
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,399
could be anything right because you got

680
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,840
the developers just wanted to get it out

681
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
and they didn't really uh

682
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,120
think about validation and you know now

683
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,240
it's a problem for you

684
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,039
as an internet responder or of

685
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,799
as really uh maybe a security analyst so

686
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,960
all we're doing here is really testing

687
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,000
uh the app quickly to understand like

688
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,400
hey can we actually

689
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
throw a payload there that allows us to

690
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
prove the local file inclusion

691
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,080
vulnerability

692
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000
uh and to do that we'll run some

693
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,799
commands inside the browser uh

694
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,760
that should execute on uh on the on the

695
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,158
apache box

696
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,919
and then present themselves on screen

697
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,600
and then boom we know we're good and we

698
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,559
can move on to the second stage

699
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
of our attack uh as i said i'm not a web

700
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,918
app security individual i'm definitely

701
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,919
not a pen tester

702
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
so if i can do these type of things i

703
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,520
think almost anyone

704
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,120
uh anyone truly can right like it's

705
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,039
really just understanding

706
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,239
you know how you can craft out some of

707
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,200
these attacks there's

708
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,799
loads of material to learn these type of

709
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,320
things you have hacking exposed

710
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,158
big kudos to them i've been events it's

711
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,240
like hacking source five uh

712
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,760
you know you have uh the malware analyst

713
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,520
cookbook that allows you to learn how to

714
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,000
create these type of attacks uh but

715
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,679
don't forget uh like uh

716
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,960
packet analysis shark too like all these

717
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,000
different things that allow you to

718
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
really learn

719
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
things outside your wheelhouse i think

720
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
that's one of the best things you can do

721
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
as a cyber

722
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,960
a cyber security practitioner whether

723
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
your offense or defense is learn more

724
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
that you don't know about

725
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,360
uh and here all we're doing is really

726
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,520
dumping uh creating that uh

727
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,879
what we've done is execute the uh the

728
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,158
back door

729
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
made some call outs brought down a

730
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,880
secondary binary leverage that

731
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,559
to run sql map across the environment

732
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,120
after we targeted a database

733
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,399
dumping credits from the database of

734
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,959
dumping the hashes

735
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,559
uh zipping those and then x filling them

736
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,600
right so mission accomplice

737
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,520
on us becoming uh uh pintesters

738
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,879
pat ourselves on the back uh we deserve

739
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,080
a raise and

740
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,840
you know and as you're going through

741
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
these things you know you i i recommend

742
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,199
thinking you know honestly like from

743
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
from the from the from the idea i mean

744
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
from the perspective of the attacker

745
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,280
um don't don't take it easy on yourself

746
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
a lot of times when i see people that

747
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,158
like

748
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
that i've been so involved with uh

749
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
engagement

750
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
where we're conducting uh purple teaming

751
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,919
uh

752
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
it's this idea of you know just get it

753
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,799
done and be done with it and then move

754
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,400
on and i'm like well that's not the best

755
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,799
approach to take i want to know

756
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,880
what sticks i want to know how can i

757
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,360
actually uh how can i actually get

758
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
better

759
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,280
and to do that i need to actually take

760
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,719
on the steps that an actual attacker

761
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,000
would attack is not just going to

762
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,200
pop in the environment and leave they're

763
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
going to have to maintain some type of

764
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
persistence

765
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
so think about how you can begin to

766
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,158
inject up

767
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,840
injecting the startup uh how you can

768
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,320
actually uh mitigate in

769
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,039
into processing loading uh things along

770
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
those lines that

771
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,000
that you know one there are uh

772
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,918
techniques for this in attack miter but

773
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,559
also thinking about it from the

774
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,039
perspective

775
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,559
of hey we paid a crapload of money for

776
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,679
these edr solutions or we paid a

777
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,320
crapload of money

778
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,000
for uh this data classification system

779
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,439
let's get the most out of it let's start

780
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,880
banging against our environments and

781
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
really understanding where

782
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
uh what's firing from that edr you know

783
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,720
and it's something that is if it's not

784
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
catching it let's go talk to that vendor

785
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,080
um you know constantly getting better as

786
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,678
a defender is i think the name of the

787
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
game and i mean not to sound like too

788
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,520
serious but

789
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,799
i think it's one of those things you

790
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
can't really take a day off as a

791
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,520
defender

792
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,799
uh because your back is constantly

793
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,720
against the wall you know

794
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,799
uh so it's one of these things where i

795
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
think you have to keep pushing yourself

796
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,039
and pushing your program uh to the to

797
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,399
the limits honestly

798
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,158
and when you have all this information

799
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
that you uh once you've moved through

800
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
the stages of actually conducting your

801
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,678
attack

802
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,600
uh and you've collected you know some of

803
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,000
the artifacts from your edr solution

804
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,799
um something that i like to think about

805
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
again going back

806
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,440
to that that mindset of shrinking uh of

807
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,159
shrinking the time to respond and time

808
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,200
to detect

809
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:28,080
is really how can i understand with

810
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,760
attack mitre what are the log sources

811
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,720
that are pertinent for me

812
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,679
so understanding of or i'm sorry

813
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
visualizing

814
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,200
that i can review a technique from

815
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
attack miter but how does that really

816
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,159
help my organization well

817
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,919
if you use something like a detect which

818
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,400
is open source what that allows you to

819
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,039
do is

820
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
create different profiles of this is all

821
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,000
written in python so it's totally

822
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,159
customizable but you are

823
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
able to create different profiles that

824
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
you can turn around and leverage as json

825
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,440
layers on top of attack miter

826
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,200
and when you place this on top of attack

827
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,320
miter you you're able to

828
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,480
uh add additional data sources

829
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,840
into the technique uh that is relevant

830
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,520
for you so if you take a look here for

831
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,279
the initial access which is the

832
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
the technique that we leveraged for uh

833
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,520
the web app attack uh

834
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,080
what we what all we did was look at a

835
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,320
few different

836
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
uh a few different log sources towards

837
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,678
the bottom you see name

838
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,360
product i mean name value name value

839
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,440
name value all we've done is take

840
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,959
those uh take those parameters and add

841
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,799
them in as log sources

842
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,400
and you can get really really fancy here

843
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
uh i should do a talk on this obviously

844
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,880
one day but you can get like

845
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,679
ridiculously granular like i've gotten

846
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
to the point

847
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,600
where we're able to add not only log

848
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,559
sources that are relevant to that

849
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,480
specific technique

850
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,080
but you're able to add the searches that

851
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,720
you would leverage from a cabana

852
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,520
uh perspective so now you know the iep

853
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,520
of that attack

854
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,279
uh you're able to search that across

855
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,720
your local and run an instant

856
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,120
uh uh attack enterprise that that

857
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
that points to a specific technique

858
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,239
inside that technique

859
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,400
you have the ability to uh view

860
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
information that you can leverage

861
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,559
quickly i mean like time is the name of

862
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,039
the game so you have information there

863
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,760
that you can take and pivot from log

864
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,879
sources

865
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,360
to uh uh to uh uh

866
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,279
vlog searches uh within whatever you

867
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,840
have cabana splunk whatever that may be

868
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,440
uh and then really understand that hey i

869
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,279
know that we are susceptible

870
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,640
to this specific type of technique

871
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,279
because we've walked through

872
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
this whole purple teaming quote-unquote

873
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,520
it's ironic

874
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,440
that that color is purple i do not mean

875
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,120
that but if we walk through this whole

876
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,960
purple teaming type of exercise

877
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,639
and we documented where we were

878
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,960
successful in the attack

879
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,640
and we've highlighted that and mentioned

880
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,440
that on the attack minor

881
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,159
uh uh framework and if i'm a manager and

882
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
i will if

883
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,000
i walk in uh and one of my one of my

884
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,039
people just say hey well this is what

885
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,720
we've been working on the last couple of

886
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,158
days we've been running some purple tv

887
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,600
engagements and here's the tech minor

888
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
you can click on the highlighted

889
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,959
attack techniques and that lets you know

890
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,719
like where we're susceptible and here

891
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,000
are the log sources that we can use

892
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,760
for uh for analysis uh i think that is

893
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,919
uh uh amazing and that's just one

894
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,799
example from from a web app perspective

895
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,919
uh what like uh nico what do you think

896
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,480
uh

897
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,880
as you as you spoke to the importance i

898
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,679
think of of using threat models in order

899
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
to create

900
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,120
resilience uh within a network and

901
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,919
defense strategy

902
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,000
uh i took a similar approach to uh

903
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,640
leveraging the miter attack framework

904
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,080
um subtest specifically to map and

905
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
identify adversarial

906
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,480
activities uh within the given network

907
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,880
uh next slide

908
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,520
all right so in this case uh we're gonna

909
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,640
leverage

910
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,080
um the the age-old uh spearfishing

911
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,559
attack but it's it's pretty

912
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
uh significant and successful in this

913
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,360
case we're leveraging

914
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,360
the user in order to execute payload

915
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,360
for us through a phishing campaign which

916
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,799
then triggers a callback

917
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,959
every 30 seconds using lldp

918
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,400
or uh better known as link layer

919
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,600
discovery protocol

920
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,320
next slide please so uh in in our

921
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,879
situation we have a nefarious actor

922
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,799
who decided to target a consultant with

923
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,039
uh with this specific email so what you

924
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,080
see on the screen is uh is the

925
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,279
actual email that was sent from uh the

926
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,879
malicious person

927
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,559
uh which directs us to um to a quote

928
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,960
unquote partner site

929
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,399
which provides a malicious program under

930
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,159
the guise of it being

931
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:26,879
a company mandated patch uh next slide

932
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
we see uh ms defender actually going off

933
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,919
so

934
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,799
so windows on that endpoint uh actually

935
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,960
gets triggered

936
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,720
however the user is able to bypass this

937
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,760
measure and runs it anyway

938
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,360
infecting this domain-attached machine

939
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,120
next slide what you're seeing here

940
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,279
is the increase of logging activity

941
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,959
based on the execution of this program

942
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,039
remember earlier we said that

943
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
there are different uh techniques and

944
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,480
and uh logging

945
00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:00,399
uh behaviors that we can use in order to

946
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,880
define or find our our adversary

947
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,039
inside of this uh demonstration we have

948
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,520
uh start to tune our logs in order

949
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,200
to uh to see what type of beacons are

950
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,399
occurring within our network

951
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,799
next slide so uh as uh

952
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,760
o'shea talked earlier about uh using a

953
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,480
threat researcher threat model card

954
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,919
we take this time to uh to look at this

955
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,320
particular attack

956
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,559
um this malware and style of attack has

957
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,080
been associated with cve

958
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:33,840
uh 2018 0395

959
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,158
for denial of service and cve 2019 1684

960
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,678
for

961
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,799
actual compromise and persistence um

962
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,960
defense and response against this would

963
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,000
definitely come in the form of forensics

964
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,520
on the end point

965
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,960
uh denying or alerting time um

966
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,279
denying or alerting on time variance

967
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,840
with

968
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,000
uh lldp broadcast or blocking lldp

969
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,559
in areas within the data center that

970
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,240
does not require um

971
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,240
non-ip uh protocols within it

972
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,480
yeah and i think the big thing too going

973
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,399
back to this is really you attribute

974
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,399
any type of uh attack that you have the

975
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,760
capabilities to create to the threat

976
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,918
model cards right

977
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,799
uh and and as you're moving through

978
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,080
creating these

979
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,240
you know you have to think at the end of

980
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,039
the day you know how do i report to

981
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,799
management right

982
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,640
uh you know there's that ad is that you

983
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,559
know if you can't measure it it doesn't

984
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,919
exist or it's not as useful if you can't

985
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,360
measure it you know you want to ensure

986
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,720
that your manager doesn't think you're

987
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,120
just spending your time on reddit all

988
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,120
day

989
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,158
and then making making a dope means or

990
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,239
something like that

991
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,679
um and something i've been incorporating

992
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
for the last two years is actually based

993
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,120
upon something i saw

994
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,240
at this conference uh there's a

995
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,239
gentleman

996
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
named austin murphy from crowdstrike uh

997
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
but he and he spoke about this threat

998
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,199
detection framework

999
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
two years ago uh and after i saw that i

1000
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,919
was i didn't totally get what he was

1001
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,000
going towards but i began to think about

1002
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,840
use cases in my environment that i build

1003
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,679
out for pocs with tools

1004
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,959
and what i what i use to bring the tools

1005
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,399
internally but typically you kind of

1006
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,919
dump those use cases

1007
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,279
and what i began to think was like well

1008
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,039
why don't we keep those use cases and

1009
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,840
attribute those to our actual detection

1010
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,799
uh so now we can make metrics upon uh

1011
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,959
those use cases

1012
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,600
and we really have a strong idea of

1013
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,240
where our log sources are best leveraged

1014
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,719
to detect different types of attacks um

1015
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,640
and

1016
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,840
and the huge sign with also murphy it

1017
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,520
totally clicked after like a month or

1018
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,199
two

1019
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,799
of him of him speaking about this but

1020
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,760
what i really really enjoyed was how

1021
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,360
simple it is

1022
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
uh that you can leverage this to you

1023
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,039
know identify use cases identify log

1024
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,320
sources and identify the action that

1025
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
that comes after the law of source

1026
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,879
whether you're alerting

1027
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,720
whether you're building out dashboards

1028
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,399
and what i like what i believe you can

1029
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,159
also do is take that information

1030
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
attribute that to your your threat model

1031
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
cards and at this any given time when

1032
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,880
you know you have a use case

1033
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,279
you can link it to that threat model

1034
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,720
card and then boom you have all the uh

1035
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,840
uh the attack techniques that you're

1036
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,840
susceptible to

1037
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,360
uh again uh thanks for uh thanks for

1038
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,120
having us sans uh

1039
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,879
really really big thanks to to jen from

1040
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,399
santiago jennifer jen helps put this

1041
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,679
thing together and she does a lot of

1042
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,039
hard work so hopefully she's having

1043
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,360
coffee and a pastry right now and

1044
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,600
watching and again big thanks to

1045
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,399
phil hagan for uh for reaching out uh

1046
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,799
but at this time we'll take questions

1047
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,239
cool thanks both very much um a couple

1048
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,600
of the questions that are in here before

1049
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,559
we uh we shipped off

1050
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,158
um you mentioned stride and pasta uh

1051
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,000
question is is there one that you

1052
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
recommend over the other

1053
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,120
um there's a couple of other questions

1054
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,480
potential follow-ons on there but i'll

1055
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,799
start with that

1056
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,000
um i think for what we just walked

1057
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,279
through pasta's uh

1058
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,960
a bit more relevant because you're

1059
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
creating you're actually creating the

1060
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
attack

1061
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,480
um and at the same time stride is

1062
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,360
awesome but i think there's so many more

1063
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,559
resources that go

1064
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,959
into stride that aren't uh uh that that

1065
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,480
aren't

1066
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,679
actually in regards like moving and

1067
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
creating things a lot of it's more

1068
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,640
processed

1069
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,360
driven and understanding uh what

1070
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
regulatory

1071
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,000
requirements you're associated with and

1072
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,919
understanding what sources you have in

1073
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,559
your environment

1074
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,440
got it um and um i guess another one

1075
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,320
that's maybe a little bit more

1076
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,279
open-ended

1077
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,158
uh is there any kind of an average that

1078
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,480
you might see

1079
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
for a particular use case uh in terms of

1080
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
amount of time

1081
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,120
that it takes to build a threat model

1082
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,880
around

1083
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,879
that that particular requirement

1084
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,239
and i know that's that i mentioned that

1085
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,320
it's like that's obviously

1086
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,159
widely varied but like if you could pick

1087
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,080
one or two use cases

1088
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,440
and say oh you know if i have uh you

1089
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,760
know a mobile app

1090
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,279
that's basic functionality versus

1091
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,879
something more elaborate

1092
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,039
even just kind of a rough guess are we

1093
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,080
talking months long or is this a

1094
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,919
10 minute thing uh i i i

1095
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,279
i i would say it's a couple days long i

1096
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,120
i'll put it this way right

1097
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,880
the higher you go up the pyramid of pain

1098
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,959
the harder it gets

1099
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
if

1100
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,559
absolutely um let's see

1101
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,799
oh i'm curious about this one um have

1102
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,158
you either of you guys done any of the

1103
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,440
uh any mapping of mitre 2 cloud-based

1104
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,080
attacks or is there anything that

1105
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,919
changes

1106
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,240
there versus some of the use cases that

1107
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,600
you'd mentioned so far

1108
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,720
what do you think nika with

1109
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,158
i think one of the things that yes yes i

1110
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,880
have i just started to

1111
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,240
uh to getting into the direct mapping

1112
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
and that came out

1113
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,840
definitely uh got a lot better when we

1114
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
looked at the sub

1115
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,399
techniques uh that's now being released

1116
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,879
it just made it a little bit easier for

1117
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,479
me

1118
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,519
to look at how uh how things will be

1119
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,559
implemented from that perspective

1120
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,000
got it um

1121
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,600
and let's see

1122
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,120
of these that are probably a little bit

1123
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,799
longer answers i'm going to port into

1124
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,918
your your hallway channel for you so

1125
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,320
that you'll be able to take a look at

1126
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,000
those

1127
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,000
uh those then um

1128
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,840
that's

1129
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,440
oh uh nico everybody likes your your

1130
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,519
guitar there's been a lot of speculation

1131
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,360
about pikachu

1132
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,640
big source of conversation in the

1133
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,559
discord um

1134
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,320
is there any particular software that

1135
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,760
you use to create those threat model

1136
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,199
graphics i think people thought they uh

1137
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,560
they did a good job of conveying the

1138
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,839
point and might be interested in uh

1139
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,839
trying to

1140
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:18,960
mimic those for their own purposes uh

1141
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,639
no vizio and draw io

1142
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,560
is a really good source um uh lucid

1143
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,919
charts as well

1144
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
physio and lucidcharts i was really

1145
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,480
hoping you were going to say paint i got

1146
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,760
to be honest

1147
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,879
so if you do that in paint just crazy

1148
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,040
they don't have definitely there's no

1149
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,040
paint

1150
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,040
a good point very cool um well thanks

1151
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,639
very much guys for

1152
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:49,839
for sharing your your perspective with

1153
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:49,839
us really appreciate that

1154
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,679
you
