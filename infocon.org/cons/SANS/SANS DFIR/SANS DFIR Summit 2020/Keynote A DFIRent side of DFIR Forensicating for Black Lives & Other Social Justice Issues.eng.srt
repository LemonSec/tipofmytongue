forensics

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
you should check out the sans internet

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,080
storm center because it's every day

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,080
and it's really short so you can spend

139
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,080
five to ten minutes listening to it

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
and i i love it because i always ask

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,639
myself what would i

142
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,198
do if this was me right what would i do

143
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,680
if i was at twitter security right now

144
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
like

145
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,680
um and you can see how

146
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
the incidents unfold and go back later

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,720
and and fix those things

148
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,639
okay so um yeah i i will think like

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,440
what if this happened on my watch okay

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
um okay so that's that's great and

151
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,960
everything but that who are you

152
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,280
right uh i'm a hacker however

153
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,719
i'm a hacker who works in service of

154
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,638
civil society

155
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
and what is that because civil society

156
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,960
is not a normal term that

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,240
you might use every day but i do in my

158
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,440
line of work

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,080
um it's the ecosystem of

160
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,240
all the different good works and efforts

161
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,719
of educational institutions

162
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
grant makers non-profits

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,080
non-governmental organizations

164
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,120
uh funders etc and we just call

165
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,560
them all civil society organizations

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
and there's a lot of great work that

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
happens on this planet that's done by

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,039
regular people friends and neighbors

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
governments

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
civil society is the connective tissue i

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,318
think that makes sure that

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
we all couldn't like rise up together

173
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,880
with a motivation that's

174
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,119
pretty neutral um

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,400
you know i'm the child of immigrants my

176
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,639
dad

177
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,080
he's an electrician amongst other things

178
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,759
because i'm from the caribbean so we

179
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,479
have many many jobs

180
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,360
uh work ethic is high immigrants get the

181
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,400
job done

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,800
all that good stuff uh and you know he

183
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
would take apart

184
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,919
tools and things that he found when he

185
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,159
was working

186
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,440
equipment and i as a child would take

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
apart my toys and

188
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,960
watch him put everything back together

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
on his side and i sat there with a bunch

190
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
of broken toys

191
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,120
but it got me curious got me curious to

192
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,719
think like what is inside of things what

193
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,880
makes up things and

194
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
and how do we take them apart and when i

195
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
saw my first computer

196
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
i was mystified and that was it i knew

197
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
that this is something that i would do

198
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,239
forever um early

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,960
in my life everything was pretty chill

200
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
we we

201
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,680
moved to this country uh from england

202
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
and um then came october 1983

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,960
and what happened then was the u.s

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:32,000
invasion of granada in that american

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,680
forces

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,800
uh lost 19 uh marines

207
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,840
military 116

208
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,199
troops on the american side were wounded

209
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,679
uh grenadine forces lost 45 people who

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,840
are dead

211
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,080
and over uh 300 almost 400 wounded

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,440
24 civilians were killed including an

213
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,840
incident where

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
um a mental hospital was accidentally

215
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,919
bombed

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,280
and this is all in a country that uh

217
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,960
i mean it's so small um

218
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
the population of the entire country is

219
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,440
96 000 people

220
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
and while this might be a blip in

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,639
american history or maybe something

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,280
people aren't familiar with

223
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
in my family and in my world it changed

224
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,239
a lot for me

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,440
and one thing i remember that was most

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
confusing

227
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,599
was the folks on tv were mispronouncing

228
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,039
the island

229
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,000
granada the the villages and towns and

230
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,120
cities

231
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,120
and i was like well if they're not right

232
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
if i'm hearing different messages from

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,399
family and friends over the phone like

234
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,440
what is truth anyway right and i think

235
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,560
all this to say you know in d4

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,000
we're always seeking out truth right

237
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,279
uh what is ground truth what is the

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,880
the the forensically verifiable

239
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,880
truth that the data leads us to

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,079
fast forward to my first real job

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,320
and my first real job was working at a

242
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,640
research facility

243
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,760
it was for a very very big company

244
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,920
uh i was working on a team

245
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
and we were doing like massive rollouts

246
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,519
of like

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
machines to all the different scientists

248
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,000
and researchers and

249
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,479
all the folks at this space and

250
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,600
it was a sprawling campus insane i've

251
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,200
never seen anything like it

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
in my entire life i didn't know things

253
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,600
like this existed

254
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,760
i came up with a lot of cool tricks to

255
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
get these images cloned and deployed and

256
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,760
serialized and

257
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,680
still personalized and my team was

258
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,760
amazed because we automated or i should

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,839
say i automated

260
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,200
um a lot of the things so they can take

261
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,800
a really long lunch break

262
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
but i was fascinated i always wanted to

263
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,279
get things working better

264
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
and i remember one of people we reported

265
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,360
to you said hey matt

266
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,120
maybe you should work with the monitors

267
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
and i thought why would i want to

268
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
lift up these heavy crt monitors things

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,720
are huge right

270
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
not the days of flat screen but that's

271
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,959
not what they meant

272
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,800
they meant a team that was kind of

273
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:16,000
the hybrid of uh pr

274
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,040
security nit and that was the employee

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
monitoring

276
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,719
team employee tracking team we had

277
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
software that was built from the ground

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,360
up for us

279
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,079
we contracted out and

280
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,160
i was like okay what is this stuff and i

281
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,000
had no idea that this was a thing

282
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,519
um there's an article actually in the

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
washington post now that we live in the

284
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,000
days of

285
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
copenhagen it's called something like

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,240
managers turn to surveillance software

287
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,319
always on webcams to ensure employees

288
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
are really working

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
there's nothing new about this right

290
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
there's there's this idea that work is

291
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,959
an exchange of time for money and

292
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
efficiencies and performance and um you

293
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
know

294
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,200
it's great that you can trust people but

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,560
maybe some people are working hard

296
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,600
quietly maybe some people are working

297
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
hard loud

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,800
this is a way that you can check on

299
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,240
what's going on

300
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
and you also can protect yourself from

301
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,560
insider threats etc

302
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
but i didn't feel cool or powerful i

303
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,160
felt creeped out

304
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:17,040
and wrong i looked into like you know

305
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,719
how all this stuff worked and and how we

306
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
these this code was working i kind of

307
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
unpacked it reverse engineered it i just

308
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,120
needed to understand

309
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
more about this like how i mean i

310
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
realized that everyone

311
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
who worked there had signed an agreement

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,920
and somewhere in there it said like this

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,320
is fine

314
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,680
and my team version of the software must

315
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
have been a lemon

316
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,040
something was wrong and the folks that

317
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
we watched never seem to do anything

318
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,000
wrong

319
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,360
i don't know what happened um

320
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,480
but it made me realize that there's a

321
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
lot of stuff out there

322
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,519
and the thing that i love which is

323
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
technology that i don't necessarily

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,560
agree with

325
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
and when that happens my performance

326
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,319
isn't as awesome as it should be

327
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,760
i love solving puzzles and i know so

328
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,880
many of you

329
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,360
love solving puzzles but um

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,800
only only when they help people does it

331
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,000
really resonate for me

332
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,199
right only when my work

333
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,680
is really assisting a greater good do

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
i feel that's what gets me out of bed

335
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,719
that's what makes me work in a rainy day

336
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,639
or with a headache

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
and i think that's true for so much too

338
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,600
many forensicators out there

339
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,320
right who uh regardless of how you're

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,040
working

341
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,600
your motivation is the same um one of

342
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,120
like good

343
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:38,560
will one of protection um one of

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,600
of safety and concerns

345
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,880
you know whether you're hunting down the

346
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,000
the bad guys uh who target nations

347
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,959
or the bad guys who target children

348
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
a lot of the work is still the same it's

349
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
uh it could be building

350
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
cases it could be finding suspects it

351
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
could be protecting corporations and

352
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
their patents

353
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,439
a lot of the work is with this idea that

354
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,959
what we're doing

355
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,480
is for the best and for the good

356
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,160
and uh i was talking to my friend

357
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,959
jessica who said

358
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,319
uh you know forensicators see themselves

359
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,279
and we i think in the conversation we

360
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,240
said uh

361
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,800
unbiased arbitrators of truth and that's

362
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,920
a really

363
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,319
great place to to see yourself but

364
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,199
oftentimes when you zoom out

365
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,279
there are things that we don't control

366
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,360
that affect our ability to

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,760
take that stance and that might be the

368
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,240
office that you're working inside of or

369
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,200
the you know the the workflow or

370
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,880
framework you're in

371
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,240
you're in the country that you're in the

372
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
rules of that nation

373
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
the ethics or lack of ethics that are

374
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,800
associated with your profession where

375
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,800
you are

376
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
it's really hard for an individual to

377
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,800
draw that line

378
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,239
for it i mean it's probably the most

379
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
difficult thing to say well

380
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,880
wait i'm not sure if i agree with what's

381
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
going on here i know

382
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,839
exactly what that's like as i've said

383
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
from my personal experience

384
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,399
you do so much and i'm actually using

385
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,120
this platform to ask you to do

386
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,480
a little bit more um maybe a little bit

387
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,760
different

388
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,760
or different so

389
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,040
i'm going to spare you with a laugh

390
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,079
track because even i

391
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,800
didn't like that joke but um what kind

392
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,439
of impact could you make

393
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,199
if you used your skills these amazing

394
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
skills that you amassed over cases and

395
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,399
years

396
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,639
in a very different place and

397
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,079
it is common for some forensicators to

398
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,600
assist their peers

399
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,800
in other countries in other

400
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,680
jurisdictions in other areas

401
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,439
to even volunteer their services to

402
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,479
domestic violence shelters

403
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,240
to survivors of abuse

404
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,519
and i'm talking about even a

405
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,270
larger distance traveled in taking our

406
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
work to the next level

407
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,160
[Music]

408
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,560
not something that's even so closely

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,920
associated with the work you do each day

410
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,279
and i think if you do this as i've

411
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,240
experimented and seen

412
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,360
it really gives me new life and energy

413
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,360
for the day-to-day work

414
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,719
so i currently work at ford foundation

415
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,000
as a public interest technologist is

416
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,320
what we call it

417
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,480
and you might have heard of public

418
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,759
interest law

419
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,199
and this is an idea that many

420
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,000
philanthropies

421
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,040
many funders are trying to create a

422
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,279
field

423
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
where technologists and people with a

424
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,839
passion

425
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,759
for forensics and digital security

426
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,639
incident response cyber security

427
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,680
don't go to the usual suspects which

428
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,480
would maybe be like a large tech company

429
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,000
or a tech platform like twitter where

430
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,720
you're very busy if you work there right

431
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,839
now

432
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,600
um or even to

433
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,600
the government or the military

434
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,839
ford foundation is a philanthropy if

435
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,439
you're not familiar that sits on

436
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:17,680
a 13 billion dollar endowment

437
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,800
and of that money ford foundation gives

438
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,920
about at least like 400 million a year

439
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,359
to fight against inequality on our very

440
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,040
new website it says

441
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,040
justice begins where inequality ends

442
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,360
and i get to wake up every day and just

443
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
push back against inequality on a global

444
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,040
sense

445
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,399
and no matter what your viewpoints are i

446
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
think inequality is something that you

447
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,079
can say

448
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
yeah i don't like that i want to change

449
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,279
that

450
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,040
and i've only been there since the last

451
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,279
fall and i've already

452
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,519
traveled to many parts of the world and

453
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,800
talk to practitioners who do

454
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,759
work similar to the work that you do

455
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
but there's a big gap right these are

456
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
folks who

457
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,160
are very skilled in protecting

458
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,360
dissidents journalists human rights

459
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
defenders

460
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,958
from the worst of the worst that they

461
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
know but not

462
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
the ones that they don't know and

463
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,559
forensics

464
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,000
is probably the achilles heel of most of

465
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,918
these networks

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,039
i had the benefit of traveling through

467
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,280
latin america the middle east

468
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,079
parts of the states in this short period

469
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,240
of time

470
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,240
and time and time again i realized that

471
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
a lot of the groups that are doing this

472
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
work their understanding of forensics

473
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,160
is not where it needs to be there's so

474
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
much room for improvement and that could

475
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
be

476
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,320
where you come in i worked at a great

477
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,600
organization called tactical tech

478
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,240
they're based in berlin and i was the

479
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,039
director

480
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,799
of digital security and safety there and

481
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,080
privacy stuff and

482
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
you know they put out something called

483
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
holistic security i would definitely

484
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,439
recommend

485
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,840
checking it out it's really interesting

486
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,679
because it's such a different viewpoint

487
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
on some of the same things that

488
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
we hold as our foundation but it's

489
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,918
coming from the space of

490
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,440
activism and grassroots and i think that

491
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
uh taking a look at that would be like

492
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,919
really interesting and eye-opening

493
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,760
to many of you if you have the time you

494
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
know i've consulted with organizations

495
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
all over this world and i've just felt

496
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,799
like you know what

497
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,880
in my role no matter what i was doing i

498
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,240
was just addressing a symptom

499
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,799
i wasn't i wasn't working on the

500
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
the main cause and it reminded me of the

501
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,160
work i did

502
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
as a child as a teenager working at soup

503
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,039
kitchens

504
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,479
because it's like i know what it's like

505
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
to be hungry i don't want you to be

506
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,600
hungry

507
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,719
but tomorrow hunger finds you and you

508
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
have to come back

509
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
and then you bring a friend but then

510
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
they have to come back

511
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,679
and it is good work and it is meaningful

512
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,480
work

513
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,520
but working on the digital security

514
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,760
cyber security

515
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,679
front lines meeting people in country

516
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,760
where they were

517
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,160
while gratifying it just felt like the

518
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,039
next job was right behind the what i was

519
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,120
about to finish

520
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,360
and the next person i would protect it

521
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,320
and the stakes are very high can include

522
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,639
disappearance death detainment or arrest

523
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
for

524
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,160
insane amount of time uh not everyone

525
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,320
has the same

526
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:21,440
legal system around this planet and

527
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,960
i just felt you know maybe if i work on

528
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,720
a different way

529
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
leave the people who are doing that my

530
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,000
peers at the time

531
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
continue this good fight i'm just gonna

532
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,640
take it and try to move the needle a

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,640
little bit

534
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
on the greater cost and that's what ford

535
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,440
foundation really allows me to do and i

536
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,840
really appreciate that

537
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
every single day

538
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,919
so i also have this social justice part

539
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,080
of my

540
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,320
talk so let me jump into this you know

541
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,280
there's a a ted talk

542
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,200
by an individual named michael kimmel

543
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,320
and he's a scholar of men it's kind of

544
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,600
interesting title

545
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,320
a scholar of masculinity um the talk is

546
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,080
called

547
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,200
why gender equality is good for everyone

548
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,199
and in this like conversation he

549
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
goes into this moment that he says

550
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,880
changed his life

551
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,158
he was a grad student he was in a study

552
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,039
group

553
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,679
it was on feminist theory and there was

554
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,720
a conversation between a black woman

555
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,799
and a white woman

556
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,039
on his in his study group right as his

557
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,520
potluck and the white woman talked about

558
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,000
oppression of women and how it links all

559
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,080
women in a kind of sisterhood a kind of

560
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,799
shared um adversity

561
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,320
but the black woman said something along

562
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,320
the lines of i'm not sure about that

563
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,480
and uh so that obviously is like both

564
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,960
very striking provocative so say

565
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,880
well and then she says what do you see

566
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,880
to her white counterpart when you look

567
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,039
in the mirror

568
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
and the white woman said i see myself i

569
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,600
see a woman

570
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,480
and the black woman said that's the

571
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,719
problem

572
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
right when i look in the mirror i see a

573
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,520
black woman

574
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,959
because to me race is visible but to you

575
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,559
it is invisible um and that's how

576
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,919
privilege works that's what she said she

577
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,600
said

578
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,520
it's invisible to those who have it

579
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,439
and when i listened to that for the

580
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,559
first time

581
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,240
i thought wow that's really powerful

582
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,918
and i thought about all the different

583
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
ways where things

584
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,159
in this world were invisible to me the

585
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,159
size of this world the struggles of

586
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,039
places the commonalities we all share um

587
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
even like booking a business trip i

588
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,000
could just

589
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,439
decide where i wanted to go how long the

590
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
trip was and how much it cost

591
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
while many of my colleagues were

592
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,679
wrestling with visa requirements and

593
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,760
restrictions and

594
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,120
and how would it look to have that stamp

595
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,039
in their passport and

596
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,678
all these other things and i had like a

597
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,720
passport privilege

598
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,799
it's a different experience there are

599
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,919
things that we don't see

600
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,639
um and you know they these things

601
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,120
a lot of them we have power to change

602
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,600
and they offer quite rewarding puzzles

603
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,639
and we are a community of at the end

604
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,240
people really love

605
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
these kind of logical challenges

606
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,080
i feel like no matter who you are no

607
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,240
matter what you care about

608
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,399
there are ways that you can connect to

609
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
this drive the creation of

610
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,000
public interest technology as a field it

611
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,679
doesn't mean that you

612
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,360
leave your job although that would be

613
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,880
awesome uh

614
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,879
it could mean maybe at the end of your

615
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,480
career you switch it up

616
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,320
but it also means that there are inroads

617
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,840
for you to

618
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,360
work now for a few hours or a few days

619
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,600
or a few weeks and we're building those

620
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,719
at ford foundation

621
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,039
i feel like no matter what you're

622
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
passionate about apply your skills to

623
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,240
that

624
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,360
and that's how i find myself working in

625
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,280
defense of black lives

626
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,199
find something that you see that others

627
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,760
don't when you look in your mirror

628
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,520
right find things that are associated

629
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,000
with maybe your identity

630
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,158
or maybe your interest or your passions

631
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,280
maybe your faith or lack thereof

632
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
whatever it is work towards doing that

633
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,559
good

634
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,918
thing so even though you're just waking

635
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,080
up and getting your coffee

636
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,000
or some of you are ending your days take

637
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,240
a deep breath stretch it all out

638
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,919
energize yourself and that's my

639
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
challenge to you

640
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:32,799
how can we use our skills to forensicate

641
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,399
differently i've been to places where

642
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,600
protesting is illegal

643
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,960
where any kind of speech against what

644
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,240
is the the um status quo

645
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,559
any kind of dissent is crushed

646
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,279
i don't want anything like that where i

647
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
live

648
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,000
and that's what led me to work with

649
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,080
black-led organizations pushing for

650
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,159
civil rights and racial justice

651
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,279
for me this advice meant that for you

652
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,840
can mean something very different

653
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,080
one of the people who are in the space

654
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,199
of non-profit ngo civil society

655
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,639
actors that do great work

656
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,039
our citizen lab and the lab

657
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,080
is run by a gentleman named ron diebert

658
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,158
and

659
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,279
they also happen to be a grantee of ford

660
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,320
do forensics in this different way they

661
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,720
do forensics

662
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,840
mapping malware stalker wear data

663
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,360
exfiltration

664
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,320
weapons hackers for hire large companies

665
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,360
that are peddling these things tracing

666
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,678
it all mapping it

667
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,199
researching it in a recent report they

668
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,520
call dark basin which i

669
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,960
definitely recommend you check out they

670
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
spent years

671
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,600
looking at a hack for hire operation

672
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,880
that went after journalists lawyers

673
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
non-profits and funders and it's the

674
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,640
kind of thing

675
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,840
where it's not the job of an amazing

676
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,279
select team

677
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,678
it's the kind of thing where every

678
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,000
region and every location

679
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,000
should have something like the lab does

680
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,679
at the university of toronto

681
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,440
among school of foreign affairs and

682
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,279
because there's so many of you out there

683
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,080
probabilities on my side

684
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,720
and if i would like to see whether

685
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,840
you're

686
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,840
in india or japan or indonesia

687
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,039
or the us that you

688
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,439
think about what can i do to

689
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,158
build this new kind of forensics or

690
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,520
assist

691
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
the people who are already doing this

692
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
work i have hope

693
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,719
and see amazing things at the university

694
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
of berkeley

695
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,320
they have a thing there called the

696
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,120
center for long-term cyber security

697
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,320
and in it there's one program called

698
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,279
citizen clinic

699
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,158
which gets students on board to take up

700
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,799
this task

701
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
and these students are exposed to real

702
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
world threats where they get amazing

703
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
experience

704
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
and so when they go on to their careers

705
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,000
when they leave grad school maybe they

706
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,080
go into defense maybe they go

707
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
into uh the commercial sector the

708
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,639
private sector maybe they go into their

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
own practice

710
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,840
they have skills that none of their

711
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,559
peers would ever have

712
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,320
because the threats that face civil

713
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,200
society and nonprofit organizations

714
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,320
are so unique right and there's a real

715
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
connection between

716
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,439
digital crimes on that end and real

717
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,200
physical crimes

718
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,080
and serious ones which like murder and

719
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,080
and disappearance

720
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,840
a friend of mine she takes

721
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,400
up this challenge in her own way

722
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,879
she's a very gifted pen tester and she

723
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,159
works

724
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,880
in assistance in deploying sensors with

725
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,080
spectrograms and audio measuring and

726
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
some mapping capability

727
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,840
in african countries that are looking at

728
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,279
uh

729
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,039
primates and gorillas uh

730
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,880
animals that are on endangered species

731
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,720
list

732
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,720
things that we might not realize

733
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,760
technology can be used

734
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,760
to solve a very old problem poaching

735
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,600
it's not her full-time job but

736
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,080
one hour or one day a week or one day a

737
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,439
month

738
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,199
of her time changes the trajectory of

739
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,960
the good work of these folks who do this

740
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,559
every day

741
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:25,520
in a way that you cannot believe it

742
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,520
amplifies their work like no funding can

743
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,120
so social justice whether it's black

744
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,360
lives or other causes

745
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,039
whatever you believe i'm asking you to

746
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
find a way to give back and i'm going to

747
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,000
help you a little bit

748
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,360
a little bit of a mapping a little bit

749
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
of a

750
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,559
options and ways to think on how to get

751
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,600
started because this isn't

752
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,520
the first time i've reached back to this

753
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,840
amazing community

754
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
and brought up the work i do and some of

755
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,799
the amazing people in

756
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,600
this work but i also seen the challenges

757
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,158
that you'll find

758
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,000
when you are trying to begin this

759
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,880
journey or maintain a project or meet

760
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,240
other people

761
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,080
form a cohort i know that next year

762
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,200
at sam's d first summit 2021

763
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,039
i wanna i wanna have a presentation on

764
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
all the amazing ideas that you came

765
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,320
up with the community that's forced to

766
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,360
just listen to these words

767
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,720
this moment so if you could meet me in

768
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,199
the um

769
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,960
discord right i'll be here today i'll be

770
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
here tomorrow i'll be checking it out i

771
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,200
would love to connect you

772
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,158
if you feel like hey you know what how

773
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,720
small a commitment

774
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,559
of time do i need or how large can it be

775
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,039
here what can the conversation be i'm

776
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,639
happy to talk to you about that

777
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,480
some of the obvious things that come to

778
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,360
mind are the

779
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,720
embattled open technology fund um

780
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,959
opentech.fund is a funder

781
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,799
of open source projects of any like

782
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,440
right

783
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,240
the idea is if this technology is open

784
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
source

785
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,440
and it's fighting repression outside the

786
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,000
united states

787
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,440
they will invest in it and it's part of

788
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,399
the money that that's generated for otf

789
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,159
comes from

790
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,760
tax dollars right and currently they are

791
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
fighting for their lives and trying to

792
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,080
maintain an

793
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,000
independent unbiased and balanced

794
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,439
organization

795
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
and i wish them the greatest of luck

796
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,600
please educate yourself on

797
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,959
open tech fund they if they make it out

798
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,080
of their current

799
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,799
uh issues they might be your first

800
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,039
funder

801
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
right they might be your first support

802
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,720
they offer

803
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,360
um a red team that can just look at a

804
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,279
tool

805
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,559
and you know it's hard to get an audit

806
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,159
it's expensive to get an audit

807
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
and they will cover that for you they'll

808
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,240
walk you through that they'll help you

809
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,679
assist and secure the product that

810
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
you're working on or the idea that you

811
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,279
have

812
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,120
or the lessons that you're generating

813
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,559
and you know some really really big

814
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,918
names in the field

815
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,120
you know like include security and

816
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,960
uh cure53 ncc group

817
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,239
subgraph others now i talked about ford

818
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
foundation all the amazing things ford

819
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,840
foundation is doing well

820
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,720
there's a project called net gain

821
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,399
because this is

822
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,480
you know for a lot of reasons like a lot

823
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,600
of play on words but i i see it as

824
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,360
this is a win-win for everyone um

825
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,360
this idea of developing the field of

826
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,439
public interest technology

827
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,678
knight foundation open society

828
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,720
foundation macarthur foundation

829
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,080
mozilla foundation and ford have created

830
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,120
this net gain program

831
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,520
and they've all pitched in money

832
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,639
to the amount of millions but also the

833
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,960
idea that we'll share

834
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,480
ideas and have a coordinated effort to

835
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,200
solve these problems and to support

836
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,320
this field which means supporting you on

837
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
accepting this challenge

838
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,959
mozilla which is known for firefox the

839
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,159
browser is

840
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,679
a non-profit that owns a corporation and

841
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,080
the mozilla has a thing called the

842
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,039
m-o-s-s or moss the mozilla

843
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,480
open source support program and they

844
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,519
will

845
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,240
allow you to get an idea in a board will

846
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,840
look at it and if they agree like hey

847
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,960
this is a great idea to open source and

848
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,399
you're doing good work

849

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,518
there's no strings attached it's not

851
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
like venture capitalism it's not like

852
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
tech for good um this is what their

853
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,879
mission is this is what they do

854
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,799
every year and should definitely check

855
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,360
it out

856
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,240

857
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,719
sack that i'm

858
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,080
a new member in it's so exciting to be

859
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,200
there with other non-governmental

860
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,039
organizations

861
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,360

information sharing and analysis center

863
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,879
and in this isac we can share threats we

864
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
can

865
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,200
talk about the commonalities you know

866
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
working in the defense of grantees or

867
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,000
foundation

868
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,200
you see so many varied attacks

869
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,320
very sophisticated i mean definitely

870
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,000
apt level sophistication

871
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:00,320
ongoing um for financial gain

872
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,240
or more most likely to to dissuade

873
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,760
and deter and slow down the great

874
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,080
progress of some of these organizations

875
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
and

876
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,199
being in that isac i learned so much

877
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,960
every day we share indicators of

878
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,519
compromise and fingerprints and

879
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,320
and and strategies and it's really

while you were speaking and i'm kind of

905
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,640
letting a few of the questions come in

906
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,000
through the the q and a here um and it's

907
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
really just the kind of thing where a

908
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,799
lot of times we look at what's going on

909
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,159
in the world and try and figure out what

910
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,000
can what can we do

911
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
and especially from a technology

912
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,320

stuff that's how it starts

958
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,119
absolutely and sometimes it just takes

959
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,119
that one kind of uh

960
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,800
that spark of interest and kind of

961
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,399
hearing hearing somebody else's

962
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,280
perspective and experience to really

963
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,440
kind of

964
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,720
grow that that interest you know very

965
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,640
rapidly

966
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,000
um so hopefully that this is gonna serve

967
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,200
that purpose for for some of our

968
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,359
attendees

969
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,799
um good question here and i know you

970
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,279
touched on a couple of these

971
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,320
uh during your talk but maybe just a

972
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,880
little bit more

973
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,560
to the extent that you can expand

974
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
specifically when it comes to digital

975
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,040
forensics incident response

976
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,560
um i was wondering there's an attendee

977
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
that was wondering if you might be able

978
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,640
to share some

979
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,560
specific dfir implementation or not

980
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,000
implementation but effects

981
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,880
in your experience yeah so um

982
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
i'll talk about maybe the unveiling of

983
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,240
the

984
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,960
pegasus software let's say right so in

985
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,759
we have in our spaces civil society

986
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
spaces

987
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
a group called accessnow they're a

988
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,240
non-profit and they're known for this

989
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
thing called the

990
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,040
accessnow helpline and what that is

991
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
is a group of people around the world so

992
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,480
they always can field your questions and

993
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,000
activists human rights defenders

994
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,960
journalists anyone who needs

995
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
assistance um can write them an email

996
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,560
encrypted or not

997
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,319
and get a response usually i think they

998
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,240
say something like um

999
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,839
two days or something like that but i've

1000
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,040
never met anyone who had to wait that

1001
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,520
long

1002
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,119
and what they noticed were groups that

1003
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,440
had nothing to do with each other

1004
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,640
journalists lawyers activists in

1005
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,760
different countries

1006
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,720
of this planet with similar

1007
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,720
um what looked like phishing emails

1008
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,078
phishing whatsapp messages

1009
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,240
um symptoms of of strange activity on

1010
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,520
their phone and glitches and they were

1011
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,399
like you know we're not

1012
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,800
experts on this right we're not going to

1013
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,640
have

1014
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
the resources to take the time to

1015
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,279
analyze this let's push it up to citizen

1016
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,079
lab

1017
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
which i talked about in my presentation

1018
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,400
citizen lab

1019
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,560
reached out to these individuals and

1020
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,520
got their phones got images of their

1021
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,480
devices

1022
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,800
uh were able to take a look at uh you

1023
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,880
know

1024
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
whether you're on an iphone or android

1025
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,200
their um

1026
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,280
your operating system or what um what

1027
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,439
changes there are to your memory

1028
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,359
um you know do some analysis of memory

1029
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
do some analysis of

1030
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,960
uh network activity

1031
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,400
and they noticed unusual pings very

1032
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,280
short small ones

1033
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,040
to an ikea address and what this led to

1034
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,599
was the unveiling of

1035
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,240
a malware very expensive piece of

1036
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,400
malware

1037
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,520
called pegasus which took advantage of

1038
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,960
you know not quite a zero day but a

1039
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,079
very large vulnerability in ios

1040
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,880
um ios devices and

1041
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,079
upon that one user action of clicking or

1042
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,560
following

1043
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,119
the perpetrator would be able to access

1044
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,000
camera

1045
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,200
phone location etc and there was no

1046
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,560
defense against that

1047
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,200
once you clicked it it was over and um

1048
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,680
what the lab was able to do was show

1049
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
this

1050
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,680
through forensics right so um bill at

1051
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,799
citizen lab

1052
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,640
um and john

1053
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,480
at citizen lab and the rest of the team

1054
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,078
there adam etc

1055
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,520
um are experts on how can we

1056
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,920
because it's difficult to point the

1057
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,040
finger at a a multi-million dollar

1058
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,560
uh company like nso group and say hey we

1059
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,400
think that you're building tools that

1060
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,320
are hurting in this case

1061
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,160
um uh anti-sugar activists

1062
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
uh in mexico people who are talking

1063
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,799
about changing to a tax or a bill or a

1064
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,279
law but

1065
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,640
what does that actually do to them they

1066
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,520
believe this is just a nice

1067
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,160
good thing but millions of dollars could

1068
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,839
be lost

1069
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,520
by governments or by companies because

1070
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,279
of these decisions to just

1071
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,320
change from a healthy diet etc and so um

1072
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,040
the nso group was employed

1073
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,480
to track these individuals find out what

1074
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,680
they're planning what they're doing

1075
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,200
um so i mean i i'm happy to go into the

1076
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,040
details more but um

1077
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,040
there are many cases like this and there

1078
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
are also strange things that like i see

1079
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,279
where

1080
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,720
people who are taking part in the

1081
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,520
protests that we see

1082
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,919
either uh you know on one one side like

1083
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,359
hey

1084
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,880
this is what i care about or the other

1085
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,200
side of like well this is what i care

1086
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,400
about

1087
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,240
just want to meet in the middle and talk

1088
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,839
and converse um

1089
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,919
they're having strange they're reporting

1090
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,200
strange activity on their phones

1091
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,560
um maybe it's their phone seems to drop

1092
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,520
off the network right so

1093
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,000
is there a signal jammer is the malware

1094
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,480
um

1095
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,359
is it something that comes across from a

1096
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,160
cell site

1097
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,279
uh simulator uh is it is it something

1098
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,598
else is it new

1099
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,960
and these are things that uh myself and

1100
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,720
other people who do this work

1101
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
we speak about it all the time we share

1102
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,000
this information we go through it the

1103
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,640
details of it

1104
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,440
you if you're hearing my voice you would

1105
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,879
be a

1106
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,440
great great um great person to

1107
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,079
to bounce ideas off of it's really

1108
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,079
unique

1109
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,200
and interesting the things that you see

1110
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,400
it's very different

1111
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,680
from what you might see if you work um

1112
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,160
you know in in the ideal of

1113
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,680
legal capacity you know i could talk

1114
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,200
about the work i've done

1115
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,440
with people who are like you know what

1116
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,520
i'm a survivor i have a me too story

1117
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,960
i'm concerned about my myself i'm

1118
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,400
concerned about my family i'm concerned

1119
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
about my privacy

1120
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,160
i want to be able to talk and say

1121
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
something but i i'm concerned about a

1122
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,319
lot of these issues

1123
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,440
and i'll look into their devices i'll

1124
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,319
look into

1125
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,520
um you know the whole ecosystem of

1126
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,560
technology around them

1127
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,680
and what you do find is when you are

1128
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,279
speaking truth to power or um you know

1129
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,919
making an accusation or telling the

1130
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,760
truth oftentimes

1131
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
that's expensive to someone and it's

1132
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,680
worth the money to hire

1133
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,440
an investigative team a hack for hire

1134
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,078
operation a malware

1135
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,960
developer to um go after those

1136
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,119
individuals

1137
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,160
and sometimes we can bring it right to

1138
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,760
the adversary's

1139
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,279
footsteps and you know there's some

1140
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,160
attribution that can be done and other

1141
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,160
times

1142
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,440
it's quite difficult you could defend

1143
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,520
your client you can

1144
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,960
help support and these individuals but

1145
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
it's it's

1146
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,880
so difficult to figure out what is this

1147
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,520
a larger part of and that's why it takes

1148
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,480
many years for these kinds of forensics

1149
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,240
to um

1150
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,240
to point to something right

1151
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,359
great question excellent that's uh you

1152
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
know there's another question that came

1153
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,480
in that actually i think dovetails

1154
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,240
really nicely to uh to a little bit of

1155
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,280
what you were just saying there

1156
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,000
um let me scroll to the right question

1157
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,160
so i capture the essence correctly

1158
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,359
um do you have any any guidance or

1159
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,520
suggestions for

1160
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,440
resources where somebody who is

1161
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,160
interested could potentially go to

1162
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,720
find out where there might be an entry

1163
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,640
into

1164
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,560
uh you know helping with some of these

1165
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,879
organizations um you know whether it be

1166
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,560
citizen labs or open tech fund or any of

1167
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,640
the others that you had mentioned like

1168
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,119
is is there a clearinghouse for those

1169
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,839
kinds of opportunities i guess

1170
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,319
and i would say there's not a one-stop

1171
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,040
shop

1172
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,960
um i see a lot of interesting

1173
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,400
opportunities on the website for the

1174
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,079
internet freedom festival

1175
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,599
and it's global it's international so

1176
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,920
that's a nice place to look at they have

1177
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,119
a job board it's called but it's mostly

1178
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,359
different things which could be

1179
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,920
fellowships it could be

1180
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,520
like you can take like when i was

1181
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,680
working nine to five

1182
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,200
i would find myself like oh i wanna i

1183
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,640

1224
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,000
work on someone's idea because i have

1225
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
this particular skill

1226
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,440
so like you know uh i i would love to do

1227

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,880
if i have 20 000 people sending me a

1234
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,359
message that's a great problem to have

1235
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,880
uh to help plug you in when you once you

1236
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,440
figure out like okay i think i have an

1237
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,520
idea

1238
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
on how it works but it's it's a lot

1239
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,880
easier than you might think

1240
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,720
um it does require because there's not

1241
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,680
one clearinghouse for this data

1242
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,359
a little bit of of a footwork and and

1243
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,319
pounding that pavement but i'm

1244
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,119
definitely happy to point you in the

1245
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,359
right direction once you have some

1246
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
thoughts on how you might want to do it

1247
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,480
or uh

1248
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,279
if that makes sense and often times our

1249
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,280
employers

1250
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,720
uh when i was working you know in the

1251
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,079
private sector

1252
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,480
they were able to say you know what we

1253
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,480
have a 5k walk that we would give you

1254
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,800
eight hours to do or 10 hours of cleanup

1255
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,319
park let's we'll let you do that by

1256
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,960
helping this group or supporting this

1257
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,759
effort or

1258
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,880
being that advisor for what turned into

1259
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,800
10 hours over

1260
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,000
you know 10 months or something like

1261
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,760
that so

1262
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,960
a lot of times it doesn't even need to

1263
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
be something that disrupts your normal

1264
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,839
work it could

1265
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,839
enhance uh your normal work

1266
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,520
excellent yeah that's a that's another

1267
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,839
good point too as far as the

1268
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,359
the incremental or i don't know if

1269
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,839
you're familiar with um the good to

1270
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,078
great kind of uh

1271
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,400
flywheel mentality where just finding

1272
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,480
some kind of a small contribution

1273
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,920
will lead to more and lead to more and

1274
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,160
you know hopefully that becomes the kind

1275
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,640
of

1276
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,480
uh the kind of momentum for each

1277
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,000
individual as well as for us as a

1278
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,880
community that we can use to

1279
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,440
build upon and you can achieve amazing

1280
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
great

1281
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,880
strategic things without having those

1282
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,000
those tiny little building blocks to get

1283
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,599
you there

1284
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,680
that's right i spent five years working

1285
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,520
on crypto harlem and just reach out to a

1286
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,118
university that's close and say hey do

1287
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,400
you have a cyber security program

1288
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,319
what do you guys do what do you know

1289
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,560
about what goes on with forensics

1290
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,520
um i have so many mentees that i've met

1291
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,520
through that and

1292
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,680
some of them are now like working for

1293
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,720
defense contractors or for non-profits

1294
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,839
and i'm so proud of

1295
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,839
all of them

1296
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,520
absolutely it's kind of funny i'm

1297
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,720
keeping an eye on some of the chats

1298
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,040
going on as well

1299
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,240
um if for those of you who are asking

1300
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,839
you've had actually quite a few

1301
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,598
questions in the vein of like how do i

1302
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,119
get involved with this

1303
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,720
we actually have another talk coming up

1304
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,000
later in the agenda

1305
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,680
where leo whitfield's going to be

1306
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,960
talking a lot about some of uh some of

1307
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,640
those progresses

1308
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,240
uh some of the small progresses that we

1309
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,480
can make to try and do

1310
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,598
good and then scale that to do good at

1311
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,920
scale

1312
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
so lots of really good good talks that

1313
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,800
kind of interrelate

1314
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,720
um you know it's another testament to

1315
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,079
our advisory board of making sure we

1316
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,399
pick talks that are going to all work

1317
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,960
together in a lot of those ways

1318
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,000
um let's see let me scroll down here

1319
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,400
we've got just a couple more

1320
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,119
minutes for um you know for some

1321
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,880
questions

1322
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,720
people ask me how to get in touch i'd

1323
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,040
actually like to take just a moment here

1324
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,720
to

1325
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:27,359
refer you to the individual uh hallway

1326
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,959
channels that we have in discord um so

1327
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,160
matt and all of our speakers will be

1328
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,400
spending some time

1329
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,359
after their respective talks in those

1330
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,280
channels so

1331
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,560
if you've got specific questions that we

1332
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,319
didn't get a chance to

1333
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,078
to ask here maybe it's a little bit more

1334
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,000
unique to your situation

1335
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,599
you can certainly uh head over there as

1336
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,440
well and and give a good

1337
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,040
chance to uh to ask those questions and

1338
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,440
uh and get some of those resources like

1339
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,880
i

1340
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,319
i see a couple of them uh getting in

1341
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
touch and what else can they do to help

1342
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,240
so those are

1343
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,960
the things that you can ask there of

1344
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,160
course um

1345
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,920
let's see um in terms of the

1346
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,520
url that we've got up on the screen show

1347
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,119

be doing the evaluations that i

1349
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,160
mentioned earlier so if you can take a

1350
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,720
moment to pop over there certainly would

1351
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,839

1352
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
uh helpful for us um i just wanted to

1353
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,759
take a minute

1354
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,560

1355

it i knew that a lot of the folks in the

1360
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,800

1362
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,000
it's really fascinating to me to hear

1363
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,839
you know someone who has a very

1364
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,319
completely orthogonal

1365
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,279
path in your career compared to what i

1366
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,720
have and

1367
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,480
realize that even though we're very

1368
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,078
different a lot of those those pathways

1369
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,720
like there's some interesting parallels

1370
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,240
of finding ways to uh to do good and

1371
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:50,480
you know it's certainly inspiring to

1372
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,040
hear that as well so thank you again for

1373
