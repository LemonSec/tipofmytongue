8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,760
talk i really wanted to

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,198
bring some attention to what happens

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,719
when you need to engage

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,360
an external ir team um just a little bit

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
about me

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,719
if i can get the slides going

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
there we go um so i am an incident

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
commander

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,879
at talos incident response that means

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,078
i work with customers on the worst days

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
of their lives

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
um from the time the bat signal is

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,480
raised

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
and so we go back into the bat cave um

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,599
you know i've been doing this for a long

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
time i have worked with a lot of

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,480
customers

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,599
i have seen a lot of incident response

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,238
plans

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
um and really what we want i want to

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
talk about

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,559
is just what that process is like from

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,600
start to finish

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
so you know what to expect um for those

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,720
of us

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,400
who are on the front lines doing this so

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,280
maybe there's some questions you hadn't

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,360
thought about

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
some ways that you could do that better

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,960
um you know i

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
am located in dripping springs texas

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
it's not quite austin

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
about 30 minutes out a fun place to

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,119
visit

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,040
if you ever get to leave your house

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,200
again um also

44
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,159
i am a crazy cat owner i'm putting that

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,479
out there because she is

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,360
likely to zoom on this so just be

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,000
prepared

48
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
maybe something to look for so all right

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
so we're going to break this down

50
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,758
into three sections uh first we'll be

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,158
engaging in an ir firm

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
so when do you need to bring an ir firm

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,640
in when do you have to work with that

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
team

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
how do you choose one where do you go

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
from there the second which i think is

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
really important

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
and something that i want to make sure

59
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
everybody does well is scoping that

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,398
engagement

61
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,719
figuring out what your objectives are

62
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,399
how somebody else can help you

63
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,079
and the third is deploying the

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,318
engagement so what it's actually

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,920
like once we're on the ground what we're

66
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:17,119
doing how we go from start to finish

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,399
so engaging in ir firm um so

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,480
when do you call one and you know

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
i would hope to see in every incident

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,560
response plan one i would hope that you

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,799
have an incident response plan

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,319
two i would hope that in there it says

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
hey this is a point where we need to

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,560
think about asking for help

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,720
but like i said i have seen a lot of

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,239
incident response plans and this is

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
rarely in there

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
so you know some things to think about

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
you know if you know you're going to be

80
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,958
going out for litigation if there's a

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,440
possibility of that

82
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,040
you probably want to engage an external

83
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
ir firm

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,720
you know analysts get tired um sometimes

85
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
they reach walls

86
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,359
you know that's also a good time we do

87
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,839
have you know a running joke within kind

88
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
of

89
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
you know ir consultants about er friday

90
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,519
because

91
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,159
it seems to be that at 4 45 on every

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
friday that's when most ers go off

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,359
um and you know that could just be our

94
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
our thinking

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
um i've done some statistical analysis

96
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,319
of it yeah it's not totally correct but

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,958
um but the one theory we have behind

98
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,119
that is a lot of people spend all week

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
working through problems and finally get

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
to the point where they realize it's out

101
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,958
of their hands

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,040
so really you know i want to make sure

103
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,560
that you think about this ahead of time

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
so maybe you can get some boots on the

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
ground some help in there

106
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,920
before you know it's things are getting

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,159
a little bit out of control

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,599
um other things too sometimes you know

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,519
the people above you

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,679
um i think this happens a lot in a

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
infosec role it's a sad thing to say

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,440
sometimes they don't listen to their

113
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,839
security engineers their analysts

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,680
when they say there's something going on

115
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
something that they need help with

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
recommendations to make things better or

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,040
to talk about why something happened

118
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,359
and sometimes having you know experts

119
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
come

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,560
in and give you that you know you

121
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,040
verifying what your what your findings

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,319
were giving you those recommendations

123
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,079
sometimes they'll listen to that a

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
little better than they can to you

125
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
and another time too is sometimes you

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
know you just need help you know

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,839
don't be afraid to ask for that second

128
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,560
opinion to get that expertise in there

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,960
okay so you've decided that you want to

130
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
have an you know external ir team

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
so who do you choose there are a lot of

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,039
action options out there for you

133
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,440
um so some things you may want to think

134
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,440
about obviously reputation

135
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
there are you know a number of ways you

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,800
can think about that that can be just

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
going to the googles

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
but also you're talking to your

139
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,919
colleagues talking to people in your

140
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320
isacs who have they worked with who they

141
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,280
liked

142
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,719
get their references um obviously you

143
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,559
can look at what the marketplace is

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
saying so you can go to gartner you can

145
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,560
go to forest or you can go to idc

146
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,919
um see what you know the opinions of

147
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
those experts are

148
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,240
what i would say about leveraging those

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,759
type of marketplace analysts is

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
look at some of the things that they're

151
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,720
thinking about what makes an ir firm

152
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,800
good

153
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
and not necessarily what's in their

154
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,759
report but what are the key things

155
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,039
they're looking about you know we want

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
to think about do they have the

157
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,080
expertise

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
do they have technology what is their

159
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,639
past history

160
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,400
what kind of threats can they see what

161
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,639
kind of threat intelligence do they have

162
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,000
those are all important things um

163
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
previous partnerships is

164
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
also something to think about if you

165
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,440
have an environment where there is a lot

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
of tech you know

167
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,840
uh tech deployed that you know your edr

168
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,360
solution comes from one vendor

169
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,880
your um your firewalls that are they

170
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,080
come from one vendor it may work to you

171
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
know you already have those partnerships

172
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,719
filled to talk to your account teams

173
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,039
leverage them

174
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
um and obviously i think one of the big

175
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
things that most companies are going to

176
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
think about the bottom line is how much

177
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
does this cost

178
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,520
um so while you're shopping and hopeful

179
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,919
hopefully you're not shopping

180
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
the day of you know look and see what

181
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,560
that total cost is are there going to be

182
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,440
technology fees for deploying this

183
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
is travel included how long is this for

184
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,039
what is the cost per hour

185
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,479
those type of things so think about

186
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,680
those things when you're shopping around

187
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,039
okay so one-time engagement versus

188
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,400
a retainer most ir firms are going to

189
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,960
offer a retainer

190
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,479
um you obviously have the options of

191
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
one-time engagements

192
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,599
the pros of that generally you know

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
there's no commitment you're thinking

194
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
about a one-time purchase

195
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,960
this may works up well for someone who

196
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,119
has limited funding

197
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,120
but you do lose some of the value that

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
you get out of a retainer

199
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,440
um so with the retainer generally you're

200
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,400
going to have slas that are in place so

201
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,719
you know

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520
if you have to call in help how long

203
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,080
it's going to take for them to respond

204
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
you can really get expectations set

205
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,199
forth so understanding what your terms

206
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,198
and conditions are

207
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
what type of technology they're going to

208
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
bring in

209
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,080
your lawyers can look at your contracts

210
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,359
and determine what what needs to be put

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,280
in place

212
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,039
you can also talk about cyber insurance

213
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,198
and we'll we'll go into depth into legal

214
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,680
and cyber insurance in a minute

215
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,520
um another important thing in there is

216
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
really giving that opportunity to build

217
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
relationships

218
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,319
really getting to understand people to

219
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
get to understand your environment

220
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,080
you get to understand the people you are

221
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,639
working with and understanding what's

222
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,960
going to happen when they come in

223
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,800
and of course you know most retainers do

224
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,599
have service packages now

225
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
so um if you're not leveraging a company

226
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
for

227
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,199
actual emergency response services then

228
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,638
you can also leverage them for proactive

229
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,080
services things like

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
helping building out your incident

231
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,198
response plans doing tabletop exercises

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,360
compromise assessments threat hunts

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,400
those type of things

234
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
so scoping the engagement this is one of

235
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
the key things that in order for you to

236
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
be happy

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
with an ir team has to be done at the

238
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
start of everything no matter who you're

239
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,759
working with this is so important

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
um so the first thing is going to happen

241
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
when you pick up that phone and you call

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
and you engage with an ir team we're

243
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
going to want to know what happened

244
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
right so be prepared to answer

245
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,638
some questions really have this

246
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,319
information around and we're going to

247
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
start with the basic overall

248
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,960
first how did you discover the incident

249
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,919
was this did the hopefully give did the

250
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,400
fbi call you

251
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,000
did a help desk you throw this up did

252
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,198
somebody get a phishing email

253
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,759
what happened um also what have you done

254
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,919
so far

255
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,800
this is really important as we're trying

256
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,080
to figure out

257
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,080
what an adversary did what you did um

258
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,519
really making sure that you document all

259
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
the actions that you've taken

260
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
and third also we want to know impact we

261
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
want to know what's happening to your

262
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,159
business you want to know what's

263
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
happening to your technology

264
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
did you have to shut off your entire

265
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
network you know um

266
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
is this all over twitter those are the

267
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,240
type of things that we are going to want

268
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
to know

269
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,480
that 30 000 foot view right when we

270
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
first start talking to you

271
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,160
okay next we're going to want you to

272
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
explain your capabilities so we're going

273
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
to want to know about every you know

274
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
people

275
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
process and technology so do you have a

276
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,440
c

277
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,800
cert on hand do you have people who have

278
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
done analysis

279
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,399
yeah what does your network team look

280
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
like do you have sys admins

281
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,600
is your legal team on the call do you

282
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,240
have a design that's

283
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,200
disaster recovery plan processes do you

284
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,680
have an irp

285
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,360
are you following it are you engaging a

286
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,560
crisis management team

287
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,279
and then of course technology so

288
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,760
backup technology obviously in the case

289
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
of

290
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
pre-ransomware deployment or ransomware

291
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,480
deployment

292
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
this is something we're going to want to

293
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
think about we wonder what i know it's

294
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,239
about your network detection

295
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
capabilities your logging your endpoints

296
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
and we'll delve a little deeper into

297
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,880
that a minute

298
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,000
okay so determining your objectives

299
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,040
so i would say this is something that a

300
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,720
lot of companies

301
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,279
don't really think about before they

302
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
call an ir firm to come in

303
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
and the reason this is important is you

304
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
if they say we want to know what happens

305
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
we may not know what we're going to be

306
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
looking at what logs we're pulling where

307
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
we're going at it

308
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,040
so if you just said hey i want to know

309
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,480
about root cause

310
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
we can get to the point where we can

311
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
tell you you don't have enough data to

312
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920
determine root cause and we're done

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,519
but really if you had said hey i'm

314
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
concerned there's data theft i'm

315
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,440
concerned there's lateral movement

316
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,040
or i just want to get recovered and get

317
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
back to speed this is all going to

318
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
change

319
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,839
how we approach this so i think it's

320
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,439
important to have those conversations

321
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
before you pick up the phone

322
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
and to really think about that while

323
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,319
you're having discussions

324
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,519
okay so determining access so

325
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
when you bring somebody into your

326
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,320
company

327
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
you need to be able to get them to look

328
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
at things um in you know

329
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,160
pandemic world most things are going to

330
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,040
be done remote

331
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,959
so how do you get an incident responder

332
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,360
accessed into your environment

333
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,119
if they need to get vpn access what does

334
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,959
that process look like if it's going to

335
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,320
take a lot of change management and

336
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,719
things to go through

337
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,920
have plans in place for that if you're

338
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,920
going to need to give somebody

339
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
credentials to access systems what does

340
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,199
that look like

341
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,279
or access to your technology stack i

342
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,000
want to get somebody into my sum

343
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
into looking at my logs what do those

344
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,760
things look like

345
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
um i know i will say you know for us you

346
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,959
know that back and forth

347
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
a lot of times you know we will share

348
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,279
places for things to be uploaded

349
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
but if we get direct tool access a lot

350
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,000
of times that's faster

351
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,760
um i would say something that you know

352
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
one of our annoyances that i have seen

353
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
in the past would be somebody going well

354
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
can't you just look over my shoulder

355
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
while i'm scrolling through those logs

356
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,360
that is a terrible way for people to do

357
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
investigation i mean

358
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
how it you know if you're an analyst

359
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
would you like to be looking over

360
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,720
somebody shoulder surfing to get answers

361
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,079
yeah we

362
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,399
we want to get direct tool access um

363
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,079
so in some cases you know we could

364
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
actually go to a place so

365
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,399
if we are allowed to leave our houses

366
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
and travel to an employee you know to an

367
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,279
engagement site

368
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,279
uh we're going to want to know what

369
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,680
facility we need to go to

370
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,040
um so this is a really interesting

371
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,040
question because most

372
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,040
companies the larger companies are going

373
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
to have multiple data centers

374
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,719
they're going to have multiple places

375
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,600
the i.t people the infosec people

376
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,920
may not be where all the data is kept so

377
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,440
are you going having people going in to

378
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,680
actually collect data

379
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,560
are you going in to help lead response

380
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,560
efforts so

381
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,880
determining where the best place to have

382
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,959
bodies is going to be is important

383
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,959
um but also do we need to get security

384
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,800
badges are there escort concerns

385
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,638
and then do you have to run a background

386
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,760
check or do security clearance

387
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,079
to get somebody access to your data

388
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
so i think this is something that

389
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,519
retainers are helpful for because you

390
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,519
can think about this beforehand

391
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
get background checks run get security

392
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
clearance because that's going to take

393
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
some time

394
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
and it will take time out of your

395
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,680
analysis

396
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,680
some legal consideration so again not a

397
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,519
lawyer

398
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,680
this is not legal advice but i have

399
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,040
talked to a lot of lawyers

400
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,399
um so one of the things that should be

401
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,319
key on your mind

402
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
is am i going to be thinking about

403
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,079
preserving privilege

404
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,519
um this is something you need to talk to

405
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,160
your counsel about

406
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
um it's generally recommended that you

407
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,639
know

408
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
especially if you're bringing in council

409
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,160
or an external ir firm this is something

410
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,319
that's engaged

411
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,639
um but we need to think about what this

412
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,519
means especially in light of some recent

413
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
court cases

414
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,079
so if privilege is for invoked does that

415
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,319
privilege stand

416
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,079
if you share your report with somebody

417
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,800
how do these things get infected

418
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
affected um but there's also just some

419
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,399
basic things in there you know do i need

420
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,480
to mark everything as attorney client

421
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,160
privilege is it a work product

422
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,079
and then something else to think about

423
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,160
too is you know if your

424
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,000
law if your legal team isn't that

425
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,040
familiar with cyber security

426
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,360
investigations you may want to consider

427
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,800
engaging external counsel somebody who

428
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
has experience with this

429
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,600
cyber insurance so the question that you

430
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,880
i hate i sometimes really hate asking

431
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
this question to the beginning of

432
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,240
engagement and getting the answer

433
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,639
i don't know um it seems absurd

434
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,399
that you know a cizzo or somebody in

435
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,519
security would not know if they have

436
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
cyber insurance

437
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,399
but frankly it's not that unusual

438
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,199
because sometimes they are not the ones

439
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
who are

440
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,959
actually you know buying the insurance

441
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,920
or not the ones who are working through

442
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,560
the broker

443
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,719
so if you are not that familiar with

444
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,920
what your cyber insurance policy is

445
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,079
get to know it read it and have this

446
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
discussion before you have your incident

447
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,599
and there's a couple of reasons why

448
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,360
actually more than a couple one um some

449
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,519
cyber insurance companies will have

450
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,920
panels that have preferred vendors

451
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,360
they will have pre-negotiated rates but

452
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,880
you can also get approval for

453
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,320
non-preferred vendors

454
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
this is something though that is best to

455
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,560
be negotiated before so

456
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
you have an actual incident other things

457
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,040
that you need to be aware of

458
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
is when do you give notice insurance

459
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,639
companies don't want to pay you

460
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
that's pretty much their goal and so

461
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
make sure you understand what are things

462
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,638
that would inhibit you getting that pay

463
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,639
out

464
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
so some things may say you need to let

465
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,079
us know within 24 hours of an incident

466
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,360
occurring

467
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,519
well find out what exactly that means

468
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,800
um also find out what data needs to be

469
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
captured so

470
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
in order to recover loss find out what

471
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,000
your policy

472
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,079
covers so it could be data laws it could

473
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
be destruction they can cover the cost

474
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,279
of your firm

475
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
they can cover extortion costs which i

476
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,240
don't really want to go into so much but

477
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,479
they can't some companies will cover

478
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,560
things for ransomware and ddos

479
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
um also you know if you had a pci

480
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,959
incident um

481
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
they can handle things like credit

482
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,000
monitoring they can cover the cost of

483
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,399
your lawyers

484
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,480
and they can also cover public relations

485
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,839
so if you have to communicate your

486
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
incident to the public

487
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,720
um you know this is something to

488
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
consider are you going to be working

489
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
with an external pr firm

490
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
who has you know the experience in

491
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
working with things like this

492
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,759
or a crisis management firm so

493
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,000
understand those things beforehand

494
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
all right so we talked about three uh

495
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,680
we've scoped the engagement

496
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
we're coming onto the ground we're there

497
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,279
we're ready to go

498
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,079
um so the first question you know we get

499
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,279
asked is

500
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,000
how long is this going to take um

501
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,120
i think people who work in infosec

502
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,800
understand this

503
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,880
better than people who are in c-suite

504
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
positions or other positions in the

505
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,959
company because we

506
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,839
understand that you know analysis takes

507
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,399
times

508
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,519
um we're not just going to look at

509
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
generally we're not just going to look

510
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,519
at one log and know

511
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,399
everything that happened um

512
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,920
so the answer is of course it depends uh

513
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,680
we're going to talk through some things

514
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,240
that can make this faster

515
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,839
but really one thing to make sure that

516
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
you and your team know and that you

517
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,079
communicate to everybody

518
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,120
is in general this is a marathon it's

519
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,479
not a sprint

520
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,560
you know we've gotten through the first

521
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
part we've detected it we want to go

522
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,439
into containment well to go into

523
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,480
containment we have to know what

524
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
happened so

525
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
prepare your stakeholders if this can

526
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
take time

527
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,679
but what's going to be helpful for them

528
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
is really having communication of what's

529
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
going on

530
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,918
what's happening so they don't feel like

531
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,199
they're in the dark but they understand

532
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
that you know if we're not going to have

533
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
an answer in a couple

534
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
hours this is not csi cyber that is not

535
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,240
how things work

536
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,919
um and one other thing you know to make

537
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,039
sure that i think we want to communicate

538
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
with your stakeholders

539
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,160
is you know you want to get business

540
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
recovery as fast as possible

541
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
but when you move fast you can make

542
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,678
mistakes you can tip off adversaries you

543
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
can delete evidence

544
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,039
um and then we can miss what actually

545
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,080
happened and then you're going to be

546
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,600
having to do this

547
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,799
all over again all right so prepping for

548
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,159
our arrival

549
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,720
um and now it's generally virtual um and

550
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,640
you know

551
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,919
even before pandemic i would say you

552
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
know most ir

553
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,919
firms um are operating remotely um

554
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,200
that's just the

555
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,799
the way the way of the land right now um

556
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,880
so one preserve your evidence um

557
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,440
it's really really heartbreaking to have

558
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,160
machines re-image before we get there

559
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,640
and it it seems like a sad thing you

560
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
know an

561
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,520
obvious thing but again people are

562
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
wanting to get the business up and

563
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
running so if you care what happened

564
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,678
don't just get rid of all your evidence

565
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,918
um if it's possible to segment your

566
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
systems and that is one way to help you

567
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,480
know you can isolate that without

568
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
actually just you know

569
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,760
destroying the evidence um we may also

570
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,760
ask you to begin initial data collection

571
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,280
and this is really um especially if we

572
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
are going on site

573
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,879
there are some things that help prac as

574
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,280
we're getting tools up and running we

575
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,360
may ask you to run triage scripts um

576
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,799
start pulling logs start really figuring

577
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,240
out you know what you need so just

578
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,200
getting those things on hand and getting

579
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,120
ready

580
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,520
because data transfer can't take time

581
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,719
it's not immediate

582
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,879
okay so you know our main goal

583
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
is we're here for your evidence we

584
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
cannot figure out what happened

585
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,960
if you don't have evidence so the more

586
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,960
data that's there the better chance you

587
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,960
have of getting answers gonna make

588
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
make everybody happy and there's some

589
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
few ways that we can do this

590
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,080
um so every ir team is gonna be

591
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
different

592
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,439
but there are some things that are gonna

593
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,280
be you know pretty similar um

594
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,200
so we can do collection through tool

595
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,240
deployment that could be you know

596
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,799
deploying some custom technology um

597
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,840
you know based on that vendor's approach

598
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,760
we're probably going to want to get

599
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,720
access to your sim and your technology

600
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,799
stack

601
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,799
we made doing actual forensic image

602
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,720
collection so think about you know do

603
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
you have somebody who has the capability

604
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,080
of doing that

605
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,559
is since everybody is working remote how

606
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,879
do you handle getting copies of dis

607
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
now how do you do that um same thing for

608
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,600
script deployment you know do you

609
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,240
have some some ability to push you know

610
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,080
push data through your environment do

611
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,160
you have a ways to collect files

612
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,240
and log collection and we'll we'll dive

613
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,000
into uh what types of logs we're looking

614
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,559
for

615
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,840
so tool deployment again like i said

616
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,918
this could be varied by

617
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,760
vendor but any successful deployment is

618
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,640
going to rely on preparation

619
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,158
so if we're deploying an agent that's

620
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
out for endpoints

621
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,240
do you know how many endpoints do you

622
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,000
have can you identify which of the crea

623
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,520
you know the critical ones the key ones

624
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,440
that you want to get first

625
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,879
um do you know your network do you know

626
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
where your ingress and your egress

627
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,600
points are

628
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
what are your emergency change

629
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,959
management requirements

630
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
do you have this in place so we can

631
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,559
actually push things out quickly

632
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,039
and not have to wait to get a cop

633
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,720
approval or something like that

634
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,559
are there system requirements are there

635
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,080
network requirements and again that

636
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,799
question about pushing agents and

637
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,000
software through there

638
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,760
so logs logs logs um even if we're

639
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,559
deploying technology throughout the

640
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,640
environment

641
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,600
logs are critical to understanding what

642
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
happened

643
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,760
um and really one of the things also

644
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
that's going to save you a lot of time

645
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,158
and money

646
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
is making sure they're synchronized and

647
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,360
making sure they're all synchronizing

648
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
utc

649
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
why you be locking your stuff in local

650
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,720
time i don't know please log everything

651
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,559
in utc

652
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,000
the other thing to think about is where

653
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,158
are your logs stored

654
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
are they being stored locally are they

655
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,880
in the cloud

656
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
if they're in the cloud how do you

657
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,000
access them you know do you have to go

658
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
into an agreement do you have to go to

659
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,120
aws

660
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,360
what do those things look like and

661
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,879
really crucially is what is your data

662
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,199
retention policy

663
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,919
um if i know an adversary was in the

664
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,240
environment

665
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,120
seven days before and your logs rolled

666
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,159
over

667
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,799
um within 24 hours i can't tell you what

668
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,799
happened

669
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,000
so we need to really know what that data

670
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,679
retention looks like

671
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
and what's going to be a dead end where

672
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,880
we can find things

673
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,840
so the network knowing your current

674
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
capabilities

675
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,678
and your visibility gaps are really

676
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,879
going to be helpful making this work

677
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,960
so do you have a network asset list and

678
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,760
do you have network diagrams

679
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,000
um sadly i would say most people do not

680
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,360
have

681
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,080
accurate network network diagrams um

682
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,320
so maybe you should get some um also do

683
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,760
you have packet capture capabilities um

684
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,918
are you taking nut flow

685
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,600
what kind of network logs are you

686
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,720
keeping so we want you know we want to

687
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,959
see nut flow

688
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,320
we want to see dns logs you want to see

689
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,200
dhcp

690
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,039
firewall network device logs ids

691
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,679
obviously there's a long list of this

692
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
but

693
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,280
what's going to be really critical too

694
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,799
is knowing what you can't see

695
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,080
if you can't see that then you're not

696
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,320
going to be able to get an answer out of

697
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,360
that so think about can you see east

698
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,280
west traffic

699
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,879
can you see what's going from system to

700
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
system if we're looking for lateral

701
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
movement

702
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,000
and we have that that capability within

703
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,760
network it's going to make things a lot

704
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,159
faster than having to dig in system the

705
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,158
system

706
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,158
so speaking of those systems do you know

707
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,360
what your servers and workstations are

708
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,039
do you know what their windows do you

709
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,158
know if they're linux do you know if you

710
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
have windows xp

711
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,039
in your environment what are those type

712
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,400
of things that are in there

713
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,559
if you have anti-virus and edr solutions

714
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,039
do you know what the coverage is do you

715
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,559
know where things could have been missed

716
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,799
do you know what remote access

717
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,158
applications are used in the environment

718
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,158
so if i know that you know somebody is

719
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,320
accessing team viewer in order to

720
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,679
you know remote in and steal things is

721
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,200
teamviewer something that

722
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,200
you know we should expect to see in your

723
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
environment being able to

724
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,799
answer those types of questions will

725
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,080
make things so much

726
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,720
easier on the end so

727
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,439
logs for endpoints and you know for

728
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,679
windows

729
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
or for linux you know we want to know

730
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,279
what happened on a system

731
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,918
i understand that keeping event logs for

732
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,600
windows boxes can take up a lot of space

733
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,520
but if you don't do that it's going to

734
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
be much harder for us to determine what

735
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,639
happened

736
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,240
michael yesterday i think had some

737
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
really great cheat sheets and malware

738
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,960
archaeology

739
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,399
on his website so i'd encourage you to

740
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
go look at that

741
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,279
um really thinking about you know we

742
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,678
want to know who logs into a system we

743
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
want to know what changes are authorized

744
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,320
um

745
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,919
we need to be able to talk to somebody

746
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,918
who can have those answers

747
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,240
so um i'm just doing this as a kind of

748
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,000
example of the way that

749
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,159
analysts are thinking and i know most of

750
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,799
you you know this is your process

751
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,559
too we're thinking about i don't know

752
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,240
what happens with an evidence collection

753
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,080
for an emote so we want to figure out

754
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,679
what initial access is you know we're

755
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,199
looking for spear phishing

756
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,960
we're going to want to look at the email

757
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,039
gateway and console logs

758
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,720
um credential access we're going to want

759
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,000
to look at the security logs

760
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,840
powershell are you logging your cli your

761
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,720
command line interface

762
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,158
most you know i cannot really name how

763
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
many engagements have

764
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,320
not been living off the land um within

765
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,639
this past year

766
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,480
i mean almost i wish i had the exact

767
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,520
percentage number but almost everything

768
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,039
there's going to be ps

769
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,120
exact wmi rdp power shell so

770
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,480
um are you taking those things into

771
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,479
account into your logging

772
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,120
so containment and eradication which is

773
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,320
i know where everybody you know wants to

774
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,080
get to containment

775
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,840
we can't contain until we figured out

776
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,360
what happens um

777
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
one of the things too i want to make

778
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,080
sure is most of

779
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,918
us as ir teams we are not going to go do

780
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,960
hands-on keyboard and re-image your

781
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,360
systems

782
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,200
so that conversation needs to be had at

783
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,120
the beginning of your scoping call

784
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,400
and talking about how we're going to

785
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,320
move through recovery

786
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
you know and most ir firms do have

787
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,918
partners we can help work with

788
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,840
or that you can work with but

789
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,240
understanding that somebody is going to

790
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,320
have to be out there rebuilding systems

791
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
and it's likely not going to be us that

792
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,559
conversation needs to be had

793
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,799
that being said there are some things

794
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,720
that we're going to recommend you do

795
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,520
and they are going to be critical for

796
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,200
your success to get out of here so

797
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,840
have you thought about doing a password

798
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
reset and can you do that

799
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
enterprise-wide can you do that locally

800
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
do you have

801
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,879
ldaps do you know where your service

802
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,959
accounts are

803
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,559
do you know how to use reset the golden

804
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,559
ticket twice

805
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,399
what if your domain was compromised and

806
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,240
unfortunately you know we see a lot of

807
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,080
domain compromises so

808
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
somebody has access to your domain

809
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,799
controller you're probably gonna want to

810
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
rebuild that

811
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,400
um so have you had plans in place for

812
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,960
that can you create

813
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,720
isolated networks so you know when

814
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
you're thinking about as we're moving

815
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,240
from

816
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,200
containment into recovery we've decided

817
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,200
what's going on

818
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,799
you're rebuilding systems you do we have

819
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,159
a place where we can put you know a

820
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,240
dirty system

821
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,080
one that you know is clean and keep them

822
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,159
out of the already infected network is

823
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,399
that something you can do ahead of time

824
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,279
uh vulnerability patch management you

825
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,039
know we had

826
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:48,159
an incident where we saw um

827
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,400
an asp.net vulnerability being leveraged

828
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
and the customers like well you know we

829
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,080
don't have that vulnerability in there

830
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,360
and then you within like the next day we

831
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,158
saw it being hit again it was like

832
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,520
clearly

833
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,200
there needs to be something thinking

834
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
about your vulnerability management

835
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
process

836
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,360
where are you looking at how can you

837
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,039
determine am i vulnerable to this

838
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,199
exploit that's going on

839
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
um and then also just some basic things

840
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,159
blocking out the perimeter

841
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,000
like how hard is it for you to make

842
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
firewall changes have you thought about

843
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,559
this is this something you can do

844
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,919
quickly

845
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,000
and then containment is not just about

846
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,039
containing the actual adversary of the

847
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,360
environment

848
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,039
it is also containing what's happening

849
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
with the incident and communication

850
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,879
level so

851
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,559
um are you do you have ndas in place for

852
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
the people within your company

853
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,480
you know are they talking to you know on

854
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,320
facebook about hey we just got hacked

855
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,640
and this information then is spreading

856
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,399
everywhere so how do you contain the

857
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,720
communication that's happening amongst

858
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,199
your teams

859
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
all right so again reiterating we want

860
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,679
to you want to get to recovery

861
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,279
but this cannot happen until containment

862
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,760
and eradication is done

863
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,440
so really understanding what happened

864
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,679
and really making sure that

865
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,799
the the ways that things got in can you

866
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,000
know be mitigated

867
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
so um if you're dealing with um things

868
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,279
like

869
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,320
ransomware really do you have backups

870
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,919
are they secure

871
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,399
how far back can you go so if we say hey

872
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,640
you know

873
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,080
we saw this adversary in here you know

874
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
30 days ago

875
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,000
even if you had ransomware that only got

876
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,120
to be deployed a day ago

877
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,120
they've still been in the environment

878
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,000
for a long time so can we back it up to

879
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,039
there

880
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,520
um so work with your crisis management

881
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,919
teams

882
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,760
also for um their business continuity

883
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,760
and disaster recovery plans

884
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,120
a lot of times they have done business

885
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,200
impact analysis

886
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,719
so you know we're going to be your keys

887
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,960
to start first

888
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,720
so if you can go to them and say hey

889
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,000
where are critical applications where

890
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,600
are critical servers

891
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,279
then as you're moving through recovery

892
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,158
you can start a plan for that

893
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,600
um also you're going to want to get some

894
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,600
plans in place for

895
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,840
monitoring and getting long-term

896
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,158
improvements

897
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,399
so are we done yet you know those

898
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,840
incident activities um so there's some

899
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,399
things to think about you know as we're

900
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,158
leaving um if we came in and we deployed

901
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,120
agents or software or

902
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,799
technology um it and it's not something

903
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
that you're keeping you know do you have

904
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,720
a process to take it off

905
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,960
also is there a need for evidence

906
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
retention are we putting things on legal

907
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
hold

908
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,320
um do you know how long your firm is

909
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
going to be keeping that evidence for

910
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,760
having those discussions are going to be

911
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,559
pretty important um

912
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,679
then the report so reports should guide

913
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,440
you through the incident

914
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,520
a good report should help you figure out

915
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,480
how to make this not happen again

916
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,720
so we're going to have some

917
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,000
recommendations um sometimes we'll just

918
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,480
do those verbally if we

919
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,159
don't want to have we're concerned about

920
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
privilege or other things but you do

921
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,480
want to have those conversations about

922
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,158
this

923
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,279
happened um how do we stop this from

924
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,399
happening again

925
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,840
um but if your report is under privilege

926
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,840
again you know based on things we've

927
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,678
seen recently consider who you're

928
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,840
sharing that report with

929
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,520
uh seeing if that is something that will

930
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,080
nullify privilege so have those

931
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,240
conversations with your legal team

932
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,360
um and last question there is you know

933
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,440
are you sharing

934
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,520
your what you saw with the security

935
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,159
community and we talk about this all the

936
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
time right

937
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,039
do you know we see things people get

938
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,360
embarrassed we don't talk about it um

939
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,120
so one of the ways that you can do this

940
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
is to work with your ir

941
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,399
firm you know they're probably doing

942
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,559
blog posts

943
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,639
they're doing case studies they can take

944
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,399
your name out of it but still get you

945
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
know what happened out there to the

946
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,639
community so other people can be aware

947
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,760
of it

948
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
so now we are actually done uh thank you

949
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,559
everybody for attending

950
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,919
um if you want to follow me

951

952
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,000

953
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,399
go listen to

954
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,279

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,199
of fun

956
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,679
um we've got great white papers and

957
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,240
stuff on telus intelligence.com

958
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,840
so uh thank you everybody and i think

959
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,840
we've got a few minutes heather

960
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,760
we do and i pinned a few questions there

961
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,678
was hang on i want to pick

962
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,640
kind of the best of the best but there

963
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,679
are many pin for you

964
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
uh let's see do any of the various

965
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,880
compliances

966
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,080
prevent or create serious obstacles in

967
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
engaging external

968
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,840
ir forensic investigations

969
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,000
i actually have not come across that i'm

970
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,600
not going to speak out of turn i will

971
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,919
say you know most regular

972
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,480
regulations are going to require that

973
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,640
you have an investigation and a lot of

974
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,399
them are going to require reports

975
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,840
so i have seen more that require

976
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,158
somebody to come in and whether it be

977
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,120
your internal team or an external team

978
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:46,000
do the investigation and then report on

979
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,879
that within a certain

980
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,679
amount of time especially where gdpr is

981
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
concerned

982
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,840
um there are time limits on when those

983
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,000
reports have to go out

984
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,918
okay excellent thank you here's another

985
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,640
one would it make sense to have an

986
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,440
external ir firm included in the process

987
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
of reviewing

988
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,720
and establishing a new cyber liability

989
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,480
insurance policy

990
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,880
um if they are your current

991
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,000
you know subject matter expert who you

992
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,159
are engaged with

993
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,919
i think it's important i'm not saying

994
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,559
they should be the ones who decide

995
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,799
what you buy um but really understanding

996
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,039
what their place within that would be

997
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
um and whether or not it's something

998
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,679
that you know they can help you with

999
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,519
again you have those thoughts of you

1000
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,519
know the pre-negotiated rates

1001
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,120
um and really determining just you what

1002
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,640
they need to capture and seeing if

1003
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,158
both partners or something that could

1004
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,320
work with that

1005
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,000
perfect and the final one and i think it

1006
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,918
would probably be better if you just

1007
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,559
answer it by typing to people or sending

1008
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,120
links

1009
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,760
but several people were asking about

1010
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,158
suggestions on how to start building

1011
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,760
an ir playbook and any recommendations

1012
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,880
