with them for several years now

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,240
it's been but two brilliant minds

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
in this field um they always give back

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,359

new things and they're here to share

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000

myself and daryl coming from

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
i think a long history of interactions

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,440
in the community

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
but i wanted to make sure that i have

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
the

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,718
okay so i am here to

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,959
give you our perspective from a

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
standpoint of strengthening dfir

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,159
strengthening trust in dfir from a

25
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
diversity perspective

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240
and a scientific perspective i am not a

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
poster child

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,479
for diversity i am an old irish white

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,759
guy but i have been working

30
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
all of my life to create opportunities

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,000
and share knowledge with

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,560
underrepresented

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,479
folks in dfir to bring diversity into

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,439
our community and also bridge

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
between computer science and forensic

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,919
science which will

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,439
get into the scientific elements of what

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,759
we're talking about today

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,720
and i'm here to tell you that we've made

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,159
progress but

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,079
we are not keeping pace with the

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,360
problems and i want to talk about how we

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
can do the

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,040
the the enable a future workforce to

45
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,439
strengthen

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
our community daryl i'd like you to take

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,158
a bit of time to introduce your

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,759
background

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,360
sure so um my name is daryl feif

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,040
and i was lucky to come into this field

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,799
fairly early i went to

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,360
um got into forensics i

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,240
found the digital forensics research

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,440
workshop

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,040
and conference i went there and uh

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,200
have never looked back i just completely

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,480
fell in love with this community and

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,399
forensics so i

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,040
i came in quite early um as a woman i

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
founded a business early in in this

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,000
space

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,280
um i've been running and organizing dfr

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,360
to be asked events for

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,720
more years than i'd like to uh to count

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,959
and um currently

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,400
working with owen on a project that's

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
funded by nsf

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
to introduce more women and

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,360
underrepresented

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,760
students into dfir

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,120
as a woman i can see there's been a huge

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
uh growth and i

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,800
really appreciate that even just within

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
the last few years but there still is

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
quite a bit of work to be done

76
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
so we're going to talk a bit about the

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
diversity of problems that we're dealing

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,359
with now

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,720
and i've been in the field for

80
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,720
almost 25 years and the

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,840
initial i think problems that we saw

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,640
early on in terms of intrusions and

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,319
child sexual assault have grown and

84
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
we've also diversified with the crypto

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,359
ransomware hitting local governments and

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,200
businesses larger data breaches now the

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
energy sectors are being attacked

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,159
also industry bank intrusions and

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
financial fraud are on the rise

90
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
surveillance uh matt uh talked yesterday

91
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,480
in the keynote

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,760
about surveillance of activists but also

93
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
there's growing concern in community

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,440
about

95
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,879
surveillance uh new technologies in our

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,799
in our in our streets

97
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,200
and then we have a growing amount of

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
what i call high volume crime the online

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,640
scams

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
car that sometimes don't get reported to

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,798
the scale that they're occurring

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
and then card skimming has moved online

103
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
and some of that is looking like it

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,040
might be government estate sponsored

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,519
so we have a lot to catch up with and

106
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,200
we're

107
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
i think struggling to do this i know

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,760
that i'm working uh

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,400
european time zones and u.s time zones

110
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,279
each day and it's it's not going to

111
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,599
persist or i can't maintain that for the

112
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,080
rest of my life

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,040
daryl i think also feels this strain

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,198
yes so i i would say that when i came in

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
everyone was pretty busy i don't know

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,680
anyone who has gotten any less busy in

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,919
this space um everyone that i know

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,800
is is working at least full time maybe

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,400
double time

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320
i know i feel like i'm hovering

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,039
somewhere between ludicrous speed and

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
plaid

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,720
um just in terms not not only in terms

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
of the

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
caseload but also the number of new

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,840
artifacts

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
evidence types of evidence problems uh

128
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,960
related to that

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,960
um and and also one of the things that

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,198
concerns me not only just making sure

131
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,320
that we don't burn out as a community

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,320
that we continue to

133
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,680
care for ourselves and and give back to

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,759
our community

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
uh if we don't take care of ourselves we

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
can't we can't do that but i'm also

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,758
concerned about

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,199
uh some of the evidence that we're not

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,840
missing some of the questions that we

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,440
don't

141
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,560
uh get asked of evidence and um

142
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,719
i am sensitive to to to those problems

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
as well

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
i think we have to start to look at

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,800
diversity and how we can

146
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
as a community as the dfr community can

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,240
be representative of those that we

148
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,560
serve and so this includes uh

149
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
educating more people to just fill the

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,680
work the workforce gap to

151
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,199
help us catch up with or keep pace with

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,639
this growing amount and growing

153
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,800
diversity of problems that we're being

154
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
hit with

155
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
we we really i think are making some

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
progress here and this is an amazing

157
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,199
event

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
open this up for free to give people

159
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,000
knowledge that they otherwise might

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,719
may not have access to but we need to

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
bring people

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
into the field enable persistence for

163
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,080
them to be successful

164
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,639
across across government industry and

165
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,039
across all the populations that

166
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
i'm i'm a strong advocate for though i'm

167
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,318
not a poster child for diversity i'm a

168
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
very strong advocate as many of all i

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,280
think all of you know me well

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,479
for all forms of diversity that includes

171
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,599
ethnic gender and sexual orientation

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,400
religion disability we have to work

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
harder to

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,400
include all of these groups and

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,479
and not only to include but also just to

176
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,198
recognize the strength that

177
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,000
that having a more diverse population

178
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
will bring

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,120
to our community

180
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
in terms of their unique perspectives

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,400
and experience so

182
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,400
really leveraging that personal

183
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,000
experience to

184
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,520
with issues to bring back

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,199
to our community so so for example if we

186
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,758
look at some of the

187
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,360
assaults that's now occurring perhaps a

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
bit more there's more domestic violence

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
i think now that we're all uh

190
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
i'm not talking about my own household

191
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,280
here but just in terms of reports um

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,840
the amount of domestic violence is

193
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,520
increasing unless we have

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,198
people in those communities who can

195
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
detect those problems we can't deal with

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
them

197
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,359
so we really need to expand our coverage

198
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,240
and access to the broader communities

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
out there

200
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
and by by bringing in diverse

201
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,080
perspectives we strengthen dfir

202
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,799
we create a broader community and i

203
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,758
i've seen this even with uh the growth

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,840
of

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,599
heather maholick and jessica hyde here

206
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,318
in in our community

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,159
over the years um i won't i won't tell

208
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,280
you tell you how long heather and i have

209
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
been

210
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,638
working together because then i'll just

211
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,758
embarrass myself but

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,319
um i did say i was old but the

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,360
the the way that heather for example

214
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,639
does so much better than i ever did with

215
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,080
the the mobile device forensic

216
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
outreach teaching and that

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
is a benefit to the community overall

218
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,119
and and

219
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,840
it makes me very proud to see that

220
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,240
happening now with

221
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,318
um with this

222
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
need with the need for diversity we

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,120
really need to focus on 21st century

224
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
skills and

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,880
i'm coming from a an educational

226
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
background when i say this

227
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
but i i'm also a practitioner and i've

228
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,560
seen

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
students cut and professionals coming

230
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
into this

231
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,959
field who are very strong technically

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
and

233
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,640
for example in programming but lack many

234
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,720
of the other

235
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
skills that we group together as 21st

236
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,560
century skills i'll let darrell give a

237
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,680
little

238
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,319
quick overview well just in just in

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,079
general

240
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,640
uh back back to the same basic idea that

241
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
we are we each bring our unique

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,519
perspectives to this field

243
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
so whether you're great in the technical

244
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,360
aspect you're better at communication

245
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,839
no matter what you have you have

246
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,920
something to to bring to this field and

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
as our field has grown there is more

248
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,160
room

249
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,439
for these diverse skills and skill sets

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,640
and if we can share those strengths

251
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,800
then we're we we are able to

252
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,080
just continue to build our own skill set

253
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,359
and also

254
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,360
continue to push the field forward

255
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,720
so and this diversity i think

256
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,399
will bring greater collaboration skills

257
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
communication skills but we also have to

258
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,720
make sure we're emphasizing those in our

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,680
education in our teaching to make sure

260
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
that this the

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,640
next generation the future workforce has

262
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,360
that rounded set of skills to complex

263
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,800
communicate complex ideas do

264
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
evidence-based reasoning

265
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,399
which we'll get into in a moment and

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
create

267
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
innovative solutions to the problems

268
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,560
that we're facing from a different

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
perspective

270
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,279
so and and the great thing about that

271
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,399
really is that is that all of those

272
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,000
skills

273
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,560
that we have in forensics are great

274
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
in every other aspect of communication

275
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,518
and learning

276
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,040
so so they can be adapt widely adapted

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
and now i'm going to get a little bit

278
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,920
technical and i'd say

279
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,160
critical of of ourselves and i've

280
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,319
learned the hard way and if you want to

281
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,439
you want to know the the real story

282
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
behind this

283
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
you can ask me over a beverage sometime

284
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,920
but

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,079
we as a community are weak

286
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,959
from a scientific perspective and i say

287
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,880
that uh knowing that

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,959
we all have some scientific uh practices

289
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
in our pockets and in our tool sets but

290
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,079
i'm coming from

291
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,560
a position where we have to learn from

292
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
the

293
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,479
forensic sciences that the disciplines

294
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
that have been doing this for longer

295
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
than us

296
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,560
and we have to accept that we may not

297
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,359
know better than our elders in every

298
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,199
situation

299
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,000
and so what i'm going to tell you about

300
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,600
is a one of the reasons that i

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,800
left the u.s for for

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,000
four years and went to uh

303
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,880
teach in french in switzerland was

304
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,760
because

305
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,279
it was clear to me that we needed to

306
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,079
really enculturate

307
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,360
ourselves in the scientific disciplines

308
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,279
and what i learned is getting

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,720
is summarized here i have provided some

310
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,000
links there's heather's post them in the

311
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,440
discord they're in

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
uh so they're in the they're available

313
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
to you

314
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,120
uh with more details but i wanted to

315
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,279
give you an overview of

316
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,120
how we can use some of the existing

317
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,519
scientific practices

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
from that have developed over the past

319
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
decades

320
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,519
in forensic science and apply them to

321
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,638
dfir

322
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,760
to strengthen trust in our

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,200
results and our conclusions so this uh

324
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,439
picture just to summarizes the case

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,360
assessment and interpretation model

326
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,680
cai and it shouldn't

327
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,120
look particularly strange or difficult

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,040
but it's structuring

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,480
the process of making initial

330
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,839
observations

331
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,160
forming hypotheses not just on your own

332
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,120
but sometimes in collaboration with

333
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,160
other parties involved documenting those

334
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,000
and ranking them

335
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
based on the observed evidence and then

336
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
predicting this is an important step of

337
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,239
predicting

338
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
the observations that would be expected

339
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,480
under each hypothesis

340
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
and in a second phase of observations

341
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
documenting

342
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,600
what's found or not found relative to

343
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
each of those

344
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
hypotheses so you you initially come up

345
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,720
with

346
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
uh an idea of or an explanation and a

347
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
counter explanation and maybe some other

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,639
explanations

349
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,479
that you're testing against the evidence

350
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,600
and the evidence is the key here

351
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,279
we're we're experts in digital evidence

352
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
and now an analysis of

353
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,639
the systems that we're dealing with we

354
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,000
need to focus on that strengths we're

355
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
not with those strengths we're not

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,079
making

357
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,880
conclusions about guilt or ultimate

358
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,000
decisions that will impact someone's

359
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
liberty or

360
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,320
let's say the organization's

361
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,839
responsibility legal responsibilities we

362
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,480
are informing that based on our

363
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,959
experience and then there's a key here

364
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
this

365
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,119
assignment of strength of evidence and

366
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,279
this is where it gets

367
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,399
scientific to the to the extreme that

368
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
we're not doing

369
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,560
this we're not using probabilities

370
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,040
that's perhaps a step too far at the

371
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
moment

372
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
we're not mature enough as a field but

373
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,680
we can

374
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,639
give our opinion of how strong the

375
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,479
evidence is

376
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,399
under each of the hypotheses that we've

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,800
documented in our process

378
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,600
the key to this is documenting the steps

379
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,040
because you

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
you want to be you want to be cognizant

381
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,639
of your bias

382
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,920
and also to be transparent so anyone

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,320
looking at our work

384
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,399
can see that we looked at alternatives

385
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
we didn't just focus on one possibility

386
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
and look for evidence to confirm that

387
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,079
we looked at the possibilities that

388
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,560
someone is innocent

389
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,959
and we look for evidence of that we were

390
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,000
thorough and by documenting it in this

391
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,119
structured way we protect ourselves both

392
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,639
against our own bias

393
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,360
and criticism of bias so what i

394
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,839
have provided in the links and in the

395
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,279
paper

396
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,959
i'm summarizing here is a summary of

397
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,320
what i've boiled down from my decades of

398
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
experience

399
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,079
in and bringing together something i

400
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,120
hope is useful to the community

401
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,319
is a step-by-step process and i just i

402
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,839
provided a visual

403
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
because i'm a visual learner but here's

404
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,839
a table for those of you who are

405
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,399
uh prefer kind of a an ordered

406
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
same steps that you would expect to see

407
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
in

408
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,199
signed any scientific process but i've

409
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,279
explained what these are here and

410
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,359
ultimately we have to communicate our

411
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,959
conclusions what i've called preliminary

412
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
evaluative opinions

413
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,719
in in this discussion but the assignment

414
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,000
of strength of evidence

415
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,440
is a tricky problem in forensic science

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,120
traditionally it's been probability

417
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
based but what i've

418
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,040
over the years developed is a a scale

419
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,599
it's a it's a continuous scale so you

420
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,639
can pick

421
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,680
values between c0 and c1 but this is

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,480
a way for for us to assign based on our

423
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
expertise

424
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
in digital forensics and incident

425
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,120
response the power

426
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,279
of the evidence the strength of the

427
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
evidence under a given hypothesis so if

428
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,560
i

429
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,519
have a lot of evidence of one particular

430
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,119
hypothesis

431
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,240
i can verify with other sources that

432
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,519
this is reliable

433
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,320
i can give it a higher c value say c

434
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,800
5.5 if i have considered a hypothesis

435
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,000
that

436
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,839
i have very little evidence of or the

437
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
evidence is fabricated or weak i could

438
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,160
give it a very low value

439
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,519
c 0.5 for example and by communicating

440
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
this we

441
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,440
are open we're transparent and we're

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,719
clear we're essentially drawing a line

443
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,720
and being very i think

444
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,240
it's our duty to be very clear in what

445
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,560
our view is and you may have a different

446
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,399
view of another expert but at least

447
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
we convey it clearly to the decision

448
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,360
makers and they can then make their

449
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,160
decision

450
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
so that that is a very boiled down

451
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,279
version

452
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,880
of a very i think complex problem that i

453
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,240
tried to simplify to make it easier for

454
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,240
us to use in this community

455
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,600
and strengthen the results that we can

456
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,040
give

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,720
the world non-specialists judges board

458
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,959
ceos so they know how strong we have

459
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,880
or that we have strong we feel the

460
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,560
evidence is for a given hypothesis

461
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
relative to another hypothesis so we

462
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
also have to say we've we've considered

463
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,119
these we're presenting them all

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,480
it's open and transparent and here

465
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,199
is our opinion

466
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
thank you that's very helpful um and

467
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
it's so exciting that we

468
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
we actually have gotten to that point in

469
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
our evolution i remember when i came in

470
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,399
we were still talking about the elephant

471
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,079
and you know what what side of which was

472
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,400
the elephant so we've come really a long

473
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,520
way since then that's great

474
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,319
um you mentioned bias and

475
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,439
um it is one of those things that is so

476
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,720
hard to

477
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:21,760
to to see your own bias um and

478
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,199
uh we can provide skills we can provide

479
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,839
tools um but there are some of the soft

480
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,520
skills

481
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,320
or the other needs in involved in

482
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,960
bringing people

483
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,439
and supporting people in this industry

484
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,360
um

485
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,160
i think because it was a woman-owned

486
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,479
business i had a lot of women who came

487
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,360
to me and a lot and some of them early

488
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,120
on and this is

489
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,559
not as much now but early on expressed

490
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,199
um that they were having difficulty

491
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,000
getting

492
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,120
getting into the field so i i wanted to

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,480
talk about

494
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,120
um kind of that evolution or revolution

495
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,760
in

496
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,840
terms of my business so um

497
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,360
it's really about access i wanted to

498
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,639
talk about access and equity

499
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,120
so so i've had um picked several interns

500
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,480
so

501
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,959
so my first um my first woman that came

502
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,799
to me

503
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,039
really to me showed this this evolution

504
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,240
actually of our whole our hold of

505
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,679
technology in general

506
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,320
so she she hadn't

507
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
didn't really know about it she had

508
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,039
found a technical

509
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,039
school and she was coming back into the

510
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,120
workforce

511
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,799
she was amazing she the bias that she

512
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,799
had was internal actually

513
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,320
she was not sure that she was going to

514
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,120
be good in tech and so

515
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,159
really what happened with her was that

516
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:52,000
all she needed was to be encouraged

517
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:56,160
and invited in and

518
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,960
i am very excited to say that she is now

519
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
working

520
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,600
um she she came in she's finished her

521
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,439
degree and i just

522
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,918
talked to her recently she's she's

523
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,280
working in i.t and in education

524
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,039
and actually helping to deal with covid

525
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
in the schools and how the schools are

526
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,280
going to

527
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,610
transition to a hybrid or virtual

528
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
environment

529
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,719
[Music]

530
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,840
so on that path as she as we develop

531
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,640
um i have seen this this change

532
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,439
in terms of expectation and also in some

533
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
of the

534
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
skills or the services that we can

535
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,240
provide to help

536
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,639
these women come into the space and to

537
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,640
encourage more diversity here

538
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,640
so my my second um

539
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,799
my second story um

540
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,320
is a little bit later on this this

541
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,240
this woman came to me she had gone into

542
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,520
school she had been

543
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,840
uh educated uh and studying

544
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,760
psych she was a psych major and somebody

545
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,799
had actually asked her

546
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,400
and suggested to her that she was good

547
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,799
at computer science and she knew she was

548
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,600
because she had been really running and

549
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,559
managing

550
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,480
the i.t systems for a company that she

551
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,639
was working for but not really getting

552
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,919
any credit or compensation for that

553
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,760
so um she has now

554
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:33,679
completed her master's she is a lead

555
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:37,760
at one of the largest companies

556
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,480
in providing forensic services in the

557
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,799
world

558
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,919
and i think is a great reflection and is

559
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,960
is continually giving back to

560
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,960
to this community um

561
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,320
and um i just wanted to

562
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,520
to just mention that that she's also

563
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,879
been an advisor

564
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,520
on this project and is continuing to

565
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:13,679
as we continue to move forward so

566
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:17,280
now what i've seen as we have

567
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,559
really started to change the demographic

568
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,918
of women here i think we've moved from

569
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:27,039
maybe five percent when i came in to

570
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,880
maybe 11

571
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,320
a couple years ago and now i think the

572
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,360
numbers seem to be

573
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,120
up around 29 30.

574
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,399
um this is completely reflected by

575
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,399
um intern number three

576
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,799
she came to me she was

577
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,760
involved in tech she was doing tech

578
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,639
design

579
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,080
um she had an interest in cyber and

580
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,440
actually that interest

581
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,678
was um

582
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
motivated by the fact that she came from

583
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,480
a country that had had

584
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,199
major issues with cyber security and she

585
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,960
really wanted to do something to

586
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,520
um to fight that so her motivation and

587
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
interest

588
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,960
in coming into this field reflects all

589
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
of the

590
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,080
the uh research that owen and i have

591
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,280
been doing in our our current nsf

592
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,039
project

593
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,200
um she has transitioned from community

594
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,200
college to a four-year school

595
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,600
and i shows all the earmarks of

596
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,600
being a brilliant reverse engineer

597
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,520
and again that's just the combination of

598
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
better

599
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,679
tools more foundation better training

600
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,960
more access and more support from the

601
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,840
community

602
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
and i just encourage everyone out there

603
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,559
to

604
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,240
continue to see how you can

605
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,039
bring new people into this space because

606
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,400
again we need more support we need more

607
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,000
help

608
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,240
we need all hands on deck

609
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,640
the problems that we face are not

610
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,000
uh you know have their they have not

611
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,880
stopped with

612
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,240
any sort of other pandemic i feel like

613
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,080
we have

614
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,679
uh we have a pandemic and we also

615
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,280
have an uh an endemic in terms of the

616
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,200
amount of data and the kinds of crimes

617
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,200
that we have to face

618
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,240
um as women i think in particular

619
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,080
we have some greater vulnerability and

620
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,240
it's my great hope that

621
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,240
we will teach more women bring more

622
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,600
women into this field so they can help

623
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,400
face some of those unique

624
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,639
issues that that we have i think we can

625
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,080
bring that perspective

626
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,120
and i think the theme throughout our

627
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,080
talk here is we are stronger together uh

628
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,158
and i want to to emphasize that that

629
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,639
this community the dfr community

630
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,320
as critical as i might be in terms of

631
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,159
the need for improvement

632
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,879
has made amazing strides to

633
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,480
adapt to the challenges that we face

634
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
prior to pandemic and and

635
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,679
during during the pandemic as daryl said

636
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
it seems like

637
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,360
our workload has increased and we've

638
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,399
responded and i think more than

639
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,600
many other disciplines or fields

640
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
we have we have the abilities to do that

641
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,918
to

642
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,640
to move online to share information

643
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,120
and share resources and also help each

644
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,200
other in personal ways

645
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,279
and someone i saw asked how do we how do

646
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
we avoid burnout

647
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,120
we have to help each other and when i

648
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
see some of the my colleagues who are

649
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,959
under

650
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,200
extreme stress i think some people even

651
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,400
here today are taking breaks from

652
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,919
active in incidents and investigations

653
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,600
out of their busy schedules and adding

654
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,720
to their

655
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,639
their load let's say i will say

656
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,760
you you need to take a break you get

657
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,159
some rest and

658
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,440
that's that's what a community does the

659
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,760
more diverse

660
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
community we have i think the better we

661
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,520
are able to

662
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,360
help each other in those ways and say to

663
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,080
someone

664
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,719
you you might need to take a break but

665
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,760
also

666
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,799
helping so we we've talked about uh the

667
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,559
helping

668
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,320
each other and i wanted we'll get we'll

669
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,399
get a moment i think

670
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,760
in in in the end of this presentation to

671
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,559
talk about some of the ways that you can

672
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,640
help

673
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,399
uh but we'd like to uh really encourage

674
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,799
you to think about ways that

675
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
you can contribute to the community in

676
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,960
it's adding load

677
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,720
uh i i acknowledge we have to when by

678
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,679
trade training interns by bringing new

679
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
people in

680
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,440
it takes more effort and we're already

681
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,039
as we said

682
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,919
feeling overloaded but is necessary so

683
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,679
that is a perfect segue because really

684
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,200
one of the things that this taught me

685
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,760
because i didn't think about any of that

686
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
coming in

687
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,120
i didn't think oh i'm a woman none of

688
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,360
that i didn't care about that i loved

689
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
tech i wanted to do the work in this

690
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,439
field i was

691
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,678
interested in solving the problems um

692
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
but bringing the interns in that

693
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,400
actually

694
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,840
to be able to bring people in to this

695
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,080
field requires support and so one of the

696
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,760
reasons that i was so excited

697
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
about the project that we're working on

698
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,158
is kind of it gives

699
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,719
us an ability to to do that and

700
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,000
hopefully we can help grow

701
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,480
um some interns and um

702
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,559
if any of you out there have internship

703
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,559
programs that we can bring

704
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,678
some youth to you that are a little bit

705
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,120
better

706
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,159
uh prepared to meet the demands

707
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,678
of this field and that's that's a

708
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,840
really what we're trying to do so what

709
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
we've developed in the past few years

710
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,360
with the support of the national science

711
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,840
foundation

712
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
so it's both a research effort and a

713
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,840
prac in practice

714
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,879
development effort developing a platform

715
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,080
and program

716
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,440
to teach underserved youth

717
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,199
about digital forensics and cyber

718
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,919
security and give them the

719
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
21st century skills that they need to

720
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,640
enter the workforce

721
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,199
or pursue education pathways and become

722
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
valuable members of our community

723
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
they're we're not the only ones doing

724
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,080
this and i

725
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,880
i will say that we all need to work

726
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,480
together if we

727
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,640
possibly can collaborate and share

728
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,039
resources that's fantastic

729
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,200
but any anyone reaching out to any of

730
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,320
these has an opportunity to participate

731
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,559
and as daryl said

732
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,559
it's so fulfilling and and it gives you

733
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,480
back energy i i

734
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,720
took this on at the time of those very

735
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,760
busy but we went into the

736
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,279
with these youth taught them what we

737
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,559
know so transferring knowledge and

738
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,640
creating opportunities

739
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,158
and they were so responsive the energy

740
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
they brought back and the questions they

741
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,640
had

742
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,799
was one of the most fulfilling things i

743
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,640
i think i've experienced in my career

744
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,639
and they ask hard questions let me tell

745
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,960
you that

746
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,240
lawyers and lawyers and eighth lawyers

747
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,039
and eighth or ninth graders

748
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,399
i think they asked the hardest questions

749
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,520
that's right no it's

750
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,039
actually they're younger because um when

751
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,279
we first started this project

752
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,158
actually we got some pushback because at

753
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,799
that time

754
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
um there weren't when we we started what

755
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,760
in

756
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,960
2016 i think there weren't as many

757
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,000
programs out there

758
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,200
and um they didn't think we could

759
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,480
teach forensics in high school

760
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,880
and um i had an opportunity to go out

761
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,679
and

762
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,880
and participate in a girl scout event

763
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,240
and none of the

764
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,919
none of the girl scout moms um actually

765
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,520
looked at the schedule to see the age

766
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,720
range because i had put like

767
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,600
seven through you know uh twelfth grade

768
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,039
there

769
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,959
and i had an entire classroom full of

770
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,879
third and fourth grade

771
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:00,559
uh young third and fourth grade

772
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,440
girls and one of them one of them

773
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,760
in particular i she just endeared

774
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
herself to me forever we were looking at

775
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,120
the exif

776
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,279
and metadata and photos and she knew all

777
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,799
about the exif metadata she had locked

778
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,520
down her phone

779
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,720
um and she had quite a few other things

780
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,200
to say which was just

781
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,320
amazing to me it's it's just the uh the

782
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,600
evolution of

783
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,000
of the field so and when presenting

784
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,639
this this material to yes to you to you

785
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,640
youth

786
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,679
who are sensitive in these areas that

787
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,520
they have

788
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,080
i think personally lived experiences

789
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,840
that are they resonate with

790
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
the the problem the risk management

791
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,080
issues the behavioral

792
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,080
understanding they're very i think savvy

793
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,158
in these areas they can bring a

794
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,360
perspective that's very valuable to to

795
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,240
us

796
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,399
i also remember when i've heard we first

797
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
started doing this we one of the

798
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,080
first questions and bowled me over from

799
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,080
a ninth grader

800
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,480
after learning about how we could pull

801
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,080
this data off of phones and cameras and

802
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,000
investigate crimes and we talked about

803
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,799
the the data interpreting the data they

804
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,399
said well how do you know you're right

805
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,840
i said that is one of the hardest

806
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,678
questions in digital forensic science is

807
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,959
it's never so you're never certain then

808
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,159
you have to weigh that evidence you have

809
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
to sign

810
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,840
to kind of take responsibility and

811
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
assign a strength to the evidence that

812
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,639
you feel is

813
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,760
appropriate and but you could you could

814
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
be wrong

815
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,720
or you you you might feel that it's

816
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,159
correct but the decision maker might say

817
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
i i don't agree and they might make a

818
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,720
different decision and those are hard

819
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,440
questions but the student

820
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,200
these youth are extremely adept at

821
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,880
picking up the subtleties and

822
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,440
i think getting us to think in new ways

823
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,520
about how we approach this so our goal

824
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,520
in the coming years to to build on the

825
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,799
the success of our cyber science lab is

826
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,158
to

827
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,960
power and continue to empower

828
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,399
underrepresented youth with

829
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,080
teaching through digital forensic

830
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,199
science and cyber security

831
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
helping them engage in uh education and

832
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
career pathways including forming a

833
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,240
cyber sleuth

834
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,279
league a growing community of young

835
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,760
and students and teachers and also

836
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,440
role models with internship

837
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,559
opportunities and

838
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,080
relationships with higher education we

839
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,120
also then want to bring those

840
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,199
those people into the workforce

841
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,840
ultimately strengthening dfir

842
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,279
diversity giving them not just the

843
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,039
technical skills but the scientific

844
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,640
reasoning skills those 21st century

845
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
skills that will make us stronger as a

846
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,159
field

847
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,760
and build trust in our what we can do

848
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,320
and make help us keep pace with the

849
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,799
problems

850
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,559
and produce better results and

851
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,840
ultimately feedback into the community

852
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,678
so bringing

853
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,199
more people in from as we talked about

854
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,039
from different parts of the community

855
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,039
that broader participation

856
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,640
will enable i think real socio-economic

857
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
change i hope that will inspire more

858
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
youth

859
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,600
from these underrepresented communities

860
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,239
to join the cycle and start to learn

861
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,080
about

862
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,960
how to be more uh how to be safer online

863
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,439
how to invest

864
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,559
help investigate problems to serve

865
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
justice

866
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,720
to perhaps get involved in ways that we

867
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,480
can't imagine yet in

868
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,320
in digital forensic science and cyber

869
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,039
security there may be new ways that they

870
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,080
can

871
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,240
uh inspire us to to expand our field so

872
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,678
this is a cycle that we we intend to

873
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,159
continue to grow and we

874
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,320
encourage you all to think about ways

875
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,720
that you can participate

876
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,760
cyber science lab is just one and we

877
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,120
also

878
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,120
through the dfrws with

879
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,080
under the leadership of jessica hyde

880
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,639
have the dfir rapid review this is a

881
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,000
free it's a publication mechanism it's

882
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,080
leveling the field it's not an

883
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,200
academic journal so it doesn't have that

884
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,600
same

885
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,519
slant of peer review it has a peer

886
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,080
review process but by practitioners so

887
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,840
it's

888
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,519
leveling the field for publication and

889
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,918
giving more

890
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,640
i'd say equal access to publication that

891
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,279
we can then

892
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,919
um provide the free sharing knowledge

893
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,399
there's a

894
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,960
diana initiative and also sans has the

895
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,799
girls go

896
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,000
cyber start reaching out to young women

897
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,240
and teaching these skills

898
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,360
so i think we're out of time but uh

899
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,159
really appreciate

900
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,479
the the opportunity to come share with

901
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,559
you

902
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,720
the experiences we have and really

903
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,080
encourage you to find ways to

904
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,159
get involved and bring more

905
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,320
diversity into our community and use the

906
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,960
scientific practices that

907
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,439
are well developed to strengthen dfir

908
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,480
thank you thank you both channel one or

909
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,880
track one was

910
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,000
literally out of control that whole time

911
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,679
and people were throwing in

912
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
great references and resources so i

913
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,519
tried to pin them all

914
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
um sans is offering a summer camp for

915
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,200
all

916
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,559
teens boy girl it doesn't matter all

917
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,240
kids are welcome

918
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,158
um so don't think it's just for the

919
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,880
girls this summer and it's free

920

minute lab and talk on mobile and

922
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,640
securing their devices but also

923
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,799
hopefully teach them what can happen

924
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
and traces they leave behind um thank

925

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,199
with me that i just want to mention is

935
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,918
you

936
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,118
taught me as you said years ago making

937
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,638
me feel old too

938
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,720
but i remember once you said heather

939
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,520
look at your list your list is so heavy

940
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,359
on the yeses

941
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,040
and there's nothing on the nose for

942
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,119
everything that you say yes to

943
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,399
you have to put something on the no list

944
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,679
and that's something that really has

945
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,480
helped me along the way so thank you

946
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,000
owen

947
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,320

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,000
