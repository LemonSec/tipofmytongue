investigations for those of you that do

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,879
those sort of things

24

and my name is uh alex brignoni like uh

25

heather said and i'm uh for

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,080
informational purposes i'm a special

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
agent with the fbi and i've been doing

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,840
forensics for

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,040
around almost a decade

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
and there's our current contact

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,759
information um you see alexis is on the

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,680
left you can uh reach in through twitter

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,159
and my twitter handle is there as well

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
yeah and and today we want to talk about

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,200
um

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,399
first the the concept behind the the

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
presentation

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,119
is time and timelining in the context of

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,520
um

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,520
of pattern of life recognition right or

41
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,000
pattern of lifetime activity

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,798
and this is a concept that comes from

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,520
kind of like the

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
intelligence services um where they

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
would

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
look at a target or a person they were

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
trying to figure out

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
what they were doing and it involved

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,640
looking at what time they woke up

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,640
um what they did their routines

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
and where places they usually go and

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,880
went to and also noting when they didn't

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
go to a place they were expecting that

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,679
play that person to be at right

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,280
and this concept of gleaning information

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,599
to come to conclusions based on a

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,640
pattern of activity something that now

58
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,560
we are implementing in our workflows and

59
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,040
the reason for that is because

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
the technology now captures that

61
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,120
information

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
sometimes without us knowing right and

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
we're going to discuss a couple of

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
artifacts in android devices

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,359
that do precisely that right we're going

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,319
to discuss

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,840
what information daily information it

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,720
records in regards to the user's

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
activity

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,720
we're going to discuss then how can we

71
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,720
parse that tools to solve that

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,840
and then what information can we glean

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,280
from that to help solve our cases

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,680
yeah digital well-being is going to be

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
the first one that we talk about and and

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
you know like alexa said a lot of these

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,760
the devices are tracking us now

78
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,519
uh whether we know it or not and digital

79
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,079
well-being is one of those uh

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,640
android features that is on it's all by

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
default

82
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,238
right uh you get your new device you

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,239
turn it on

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
uh it's gonna be tracking what you do in

85
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
the background

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,879
and so uh speaking of background just a

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
little bit about the history behind it

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,560
it was introduced uh by google in 2018

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,599
and it was first seen

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,519
in uh android pie and then

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,159
in 2019 it started rolling out beyond

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
uh the pixel and uh android one branded

93
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
devices google has a tendency to

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
you know kind of tiptoe in the water a

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
little bit when they introduce new

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,679
things and then

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,879
if it catches on they they push

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,560
everything out

99
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
they did an interesting thing in the

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
fall of last year in september

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
they now require that digital well-being

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
like features

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,319
um be present on any phone that launches

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,798
with or upgrades to android 9 or 10.

105
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,079
so we're going to start seeing this in

106
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
in every phone

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,040
uh from this point forward until google

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,238
decides that they're going to they're

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
going to cut it off

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,519
now this requirement is actually baked

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
into the google mobile services contract

112
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,319
so

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,679
if handset manufacturers want to use

114
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
google services so

115
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
you know google play store gmail and the

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,679
like they're going to have to have

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,359
digital well-being like features on

118
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
their phones

119
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
now they can opt to use google's

120
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
homegrown solution or they can opt to do

121
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
their own

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
and if they do off their own to do their

123
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,238
own there's going to be three things

124
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,000
they have to keep tabs on

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,440
how long the screen was on how many

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,280
times the device is unlocked

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,360
and uh um how many notifications

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,039
the device receives through the day and

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,639
you'll see that you'll actually get some

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,680
of the state on a perhaps basis so you

131
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
can tell if you're spending too much

132
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,400
time in twitter or

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,720
uh tic toc right and hopefully you can

134
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,159
make a healthy decision about

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
how much time you're on your phone and i

136
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,520
think that that was the aim of google

137
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
of google's so this is what the the user

138
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
sees this is a digital well-being

139
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,840
dashboard

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
the screenshot on the left actually

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,039
comes from a pixel 3.

142
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,199
the one in the middle comes from a

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,520
oneplus 7t

144
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,479
uh and as you can see they're very

145
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
similar these are

146
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,800
google solutions um oneplus opted to go

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
with google

148
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
now the uh the weird looking one on the

149
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,639
right and i know this will come to

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,479
a shock as people who do the samsung

151
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
device examinations they opted to go

152
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
their own route so they've got their own

153
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,960
homegrown solution

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
that does have some forensic

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
implications that we'll talk about in

156
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
just a few minutes

157
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,840
here you can see this is where digital

158
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
well-being actually sits in the file

159
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,599
system

160
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
the ability to get to this data is going

161
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
to be dependent upon the state of the

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,639
phone so

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,479
is the phone rooted or not uh or the

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
extraction capabilities of your tools if

165
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,560
your tools can get to this part of the

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
file system

167
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,840
you're going to be able to to get to

168
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,080
this data and you can see

169
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,560
the names is pretty self-explanatory

170
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,719
android.apps.wellbeing

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
and on the right you can see the name of

172
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,560
the database

173
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,479
app underscore usage

174
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,919
the the first table that we we want to

175
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,000
take a look at is events

176
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,758
uh and this table has a couple of bits

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
of information that we're after the

178
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
first being the timestamp

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,199
uh right we want to know when things

180
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,160
happen and there it's stored in epoch

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,360
timestamp

182
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
easily you know convertible the next

183
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,639
column

184
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
type right next to timestamp the codes

185
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
that you'll see

186
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,359
in the type field are usage stat codes

187
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
so if you're familiar with usage stats

188
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
or you know

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
you you've done forensics on those and i

190
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,000
know alexis has done

191
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,680
a lot of work with using stats those

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
codes will actually look very familiar

193
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,919
to you but if you're not familiar

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,000
those codes are well documented on the

195
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,599
android developer web pages so if you

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,520
need to know what code is what

197
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
you can head over there and take a look

198
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,960
and see

199
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,639
what those codes actually mean the next

200
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,359
column just to the right of type is

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,919
package id and that actually refers to

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
the um

203
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,120
the packages table which is just it's

204
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,160
just a listing of all the

205
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,680
apps that are currently uh on the phone

206
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,800
so a nice sql query will

207
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,639
get this uh data for you and don't worry

208
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
about writing the sql queries down uh

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,000
if you join us in the discord channel

210
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
after the talk i'm going to post those

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
sql queries so you can copy them out or

212
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,840
write them down

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
that way you can have them when you when

214
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,280
you up when you leave

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,440
as you can see there's quite a few

216
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,198
events that we can track a couple that

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
are notable is that we can see when

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,919
devices are unlocked

219
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,520
so the event type 18 which is

220
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,440
which is nice we can see when when a

221
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,758
user unlocks their device right

222
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
and the two at the bottom uh this is a

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,960
really nice find

224
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
that uh you know we can now explicitly

225
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,799
see when devices are shut down

226
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
and when they're powered up and that is

227
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,479
a very nice uh

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
data point to have now i've highlighted

229
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,680
the the notification

230
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,080
event type the reason being is that this

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
is actually not a usage stat you won't

232
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,479
find this on the android developer page

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
but

234
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,758
event type 12 actually represents a

235
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
notification

236
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,479
it may be a notification that uh you

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
know that we traditionally think of

238
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
in that you know i received a message

239
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,359
and i got a notification card that came

240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
down from the top or

241
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
you know i received a notification that

242
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,280
was persistent it landed in the middle

243
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
of my screen and i had to dismiss it

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,719
that may or may not be the case you need

245
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,759
to

246
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,520
cooperate uh this data point with other

247
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,639
data points on the phone to make sure

248
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
that that

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
is a traditional notification i do know

250
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
that cell bright physical analyzer

251
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
parses digital well-being data now and i

252
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,000
think that they list

253
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
this event type as a notification

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
interruption which is

255
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,320
a really good way to uh to think about

256
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
it

257
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,640
this is some output from that sql query

258
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,880
on the on the pixel

259
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
uh at the top of the orange box you can

260
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,680
see i have it in a messaging app called

261
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,760
wire and then towards the bottom of

262
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,439
that orange box the last two lines as a

263
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
matter of fact you can see that the

264
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,680
launcher

265
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,480
paused and then stopped um

266
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,959
and then the first line in the uh in

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
that blue box the twitter notification

268
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
notice the difference in the timestamps

269
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,199
there was a there was a break in the

270
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,680
action

271
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,480
the phone actually uh locked at that

272
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,040
point it was

273
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,760
and i don't remember if it was a manual

274
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,599
lock

275
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
or i the screen just timed out but

276
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
either way the phone was locked and

277
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
we'll talk about device locks in in a

278
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,839
few minutes but you can see i got two

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
notifications

280
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,040
one from twitter and then about four

281
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,000
minutes later i got one

282
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
from gmail and then just below that in

283
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
the red box

284
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
about a second later you can see that

285
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,240
the launcher resumed and

286
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,240
the device was unlocked i woke my phone

287
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,760
put my passcode in and i check my gmail

288
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
notification so that's

289
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,800
you get a really good granular look as

290
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,440
as

291
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,439
what is going on uh on on device

292
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
this is some sample output from the

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,560
oneplus 7t looks very

294
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,239
familiar just because they are using

295
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,359
google's uh solution

296
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,240
uh at the bottom of the blue box

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,839
uh the last two entries you can see uh

298
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,160
the launcher stopped

299
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,200
and then i've got an explicit shutdown

300
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
in there i've made

301
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
i shut the phone off and then about nine

302
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,160
minutes later uh you can see the device

303
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
was started

304
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,319
again about three quarters of the way

305
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,599
down you can see the device was unlocked

306
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,800
and the launcher resumes so that

307
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
represents me

308
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,199
uh turning the phone on being presented

309
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,279
with the uh the pen pad

310
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
i put my passcode in and then i'm back

311
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,519
on the home screen

312
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,600
so again very good granular data uh

313
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
on device that you can see from this

314
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,839
database

315
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,120
uh as it turns out digital well being

316
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,040
actually

317
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,040
will keep your web history so

318
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,480
the table component underscore events

319
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
has

320
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,399
the time stamp the type and the

321
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
component id and the component id just

322
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,399
refers to the components

323
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
uh table which you can see there on the

324
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
right

325
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,719
now the type codes are the same their

326
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,920
use of stat code so you'll

327
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,959
you'll see uh in just a minute the

328
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,719
codes that are there one thing to note

329
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,000
about this this web history

330
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
um feature it will only capture top

331
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,040
level

332
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
domains so if for example i go to rs

333
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
technica and i pick an article and i

334
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,880
want to

335
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,959
read the article you're not going to see

336
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,320
me

337
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,719
do that you're just going to see that i

338
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,959
was on rs technical

339
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
arts technica excuse me you won't see

340
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,680
any specific urls there

341
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,040
obviously you can go to different areas

342
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,519
on the phone to pick that out but just

343
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,279
know that you're just going to get

344
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,760
these top level domains uh as before

345
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
if you run a sql query again don't worry

346
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,240
about writing this down we'll have this

347
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,319
in the disk

348
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
discord channel for you when we're done

349
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,959
there's only two event types that i have

350
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
observed in this uh table uh just

351
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,880
resumed

352
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,440
and paused and when you run it um

353
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,000
you can see uh chrome right and you can

354
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
see it's

355
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,760
it's a very nice uh timeline and it's

356
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,959
you know

357
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,279
uh resumed pause or resume pause

358
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,479
just go down the line and uh you know

359
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
you can see where

360
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,720
a user went now a couple things

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,720
about this now this feature the web

362
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
history feature is not on by default a

363
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
user is going to have to opt into this

364
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,680
feature

365
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,560
uh if it is to be captured in digital

366
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
well-being

367
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
and if you can look there on the

368
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,240
screenshot uh on the right towards the

369
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
bottom

370
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
it's shaded out and i've tried to

371
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,800
highlight as best i can you can see it

372
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,399
says show sites

373
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
if you press that button you get the

374
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,839
splash screen that you see there

375
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,760
the neat thing about this is that if you

376
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,200
do opt in a layer point to show

377
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,920
history you are going to have

378
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
chrome history imported into this into

379
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,719
digital well-being so it's not just

380
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,000
going to start recording from that point

381
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
forward you're going to get previous

382
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
history as well

383
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,560
now i did not get a chance to test this

384
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,320
with other

385
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,239
web browsers so i'm not sure if this

386
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
behavior is the same for

387
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,800
uh you know firefox opera microsoft edge

388
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,319
for android

389
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,399
so there's some more testing that needs

390
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,639
to be done there but just know that uh

391
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
you know if you don't see any web

392
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,279
history

393
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,200
it's just because they may not have

394
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,959
opted in to this particular feature

395
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,320
now as i mentioned before samsung

396
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,040
they're doing their own thing

397
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
i know that comes with for a lot of

398
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,079
people

399
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,920
they have developed their own in-house

400
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,160
solution uh but funny enough the name's

401
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,120
the same it's just digital well-being

402
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,040
and as you remember before the uh from

403
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,279
the screenshots at the top of the

404
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,160
presentation it looks a little different

405
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,320
but the names

406
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:36,880
are the names are different too so

407
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,959
back one um so the apk name is different

408
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
uh the database name is different

409
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,399
but a good thing for examiners is that

410
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
the uh

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,760
samsung has opted to use seven

412
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,519
additional codes

413
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,120
that are not seen in the google solution

414
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,320
so you're going to get more data from a

415
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,079
samsung phone

416
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
uh digital wellbeing solution than you

417
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,719
would from a google selection which is

418
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,279
great but the downside is that you're

419
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
not

420
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,519
going to get as much data potentially

421
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,240
they are strictly adhering to the google

422
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,279
requirement

423
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,880
that uh for handset manufacturers that

424
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,399
use their own solution

425
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
they can only keep they have to keep at

426
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,199
least one week's worth of data and

427
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,800
samsung is really sticking to that

428
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,880
and then the last thing obviously down

429
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
there at the bottom web history is not

430
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
an

431
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,800
option in the samsung solution so you're

432
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,800
not going to see any web history

433
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,040
uh in samsung digital well-being

434
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
again it sits in the same file path as

435
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,199
before

436
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,439
that data data file path and again the

437
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
the folder name is different uh samsung

438
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,079
android forest

439
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
i have no idea where that where that

440
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,599
would have come from uh and then the

441
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519
database that we're after

442
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,839
is over there on the right the dwb

443
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
common dot db

444
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,040
the table names are different too but

445
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,480
they're not so different that you're not

446
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,839
going to be able to figure out what's

447
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
going on here we're looking at usage

448
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,120
events and we've got our timestamp again

449
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,800
in epoch the event type is just again

450
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
those are those usual stack codes that

451
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,439
you're

452
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,760
you're used to seeing and all the way on

453
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
the right is we've got the package id

454
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,680
which just refers to

455
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,079
the found packages table and just like

456
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,519
before this is just a quick listing of

457
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,560
all the apps that are currently on the

458
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,639
phone

459
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
and as you can see this sql query is a

460
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,360
little bit more crowded than before and

461
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,359
that's just because we've got more

462
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,720
usage codes to deal with i'll draw your

463
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
attention to just a couple

464
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,040
the first one being the device lock

465
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,599
usage event

466
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,759
now one thing to note about this uh

467
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,320
particular event there's no way to

468
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,000
to ascertain whether this is a lock that

469
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
was initiated by the user in other words

470
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
i pressed the power button on my phone

471
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
or if it was a lock due to the phone

472
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,040
timing out in other words the screen

473
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,959
timeout uh threshold of reach and the

474
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,880
screen or the phone lock

475
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,479
now you could do some quick math to

476
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,079
figure this out you could look

477
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,240
and see what the the screen timeout

478
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,439
settings are and then you know look at

479
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,639
when this lock

480
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
event occurs in context and potentially

481
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,880
figure out that you know i've got a

482
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,079
user-initiated lock versus one that is

483
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
done by screen timeout the other uh

484
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,319
code event type that i'll draw your

485
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
attention to is the screen interactive

486
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,759
for samsung we can actually see when the

487
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,959
screen's on uh in this case we can see

488
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,920
when the screen is on

489
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,758
and uh able to accept input so that's

490
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
that's nice to see too if the screen was

491
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
you know if the phone was moved for some

492
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,079
odd reason and the screen came on

493
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,560
that would be good information to know

494
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,638
and

495
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,399
again just running a quick sequel that

496
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
sql query and here's a snippet of some

497
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,120
output here

498
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,639
and you can see uh in the blue box about

499
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
three quarters of the way down we've got

500
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,199
a possible device

501
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,279
the device basically locked and you can

502
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,399
see at the bottom of the blue box

503
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,240
the launcher stopped so

504
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
that's good to know that you know the

505
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
device locked and it stopped and then

506
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,959
about three seconds later the device

507
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,920
was uh you know screen or the launcher

508
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,439
rather came on

509
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
and the device was unlocked and then i

510
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,440
went into um digital well-being which is

511
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,560
all the way down there at the

512
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,480
at the tail of the red block there

513
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,839
now there are some limitations about uh

514
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,559
with digital well-being

515
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,958
the first being that uh the retention

516
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,039
time

517
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
right samsung is really adhering to that

518
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,199
one week timeline

519
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,879
and uh but there's there's nothing uh

520
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,559
document about how

521
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
google's solution is handling it you

522
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,079
know when does this data start rolling

523
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,640
over on itself or when does it start

524
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,359
getting

525
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
purged from the database we don't know

526
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,240
um

527
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,678
just if you were to look at my android

528
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
10 image that i released earlier this

529
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,919
year

530
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
there's two weeks worth of data in there

531
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,320
and that actually represents the entire

532
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
time of uh data generation for that

533
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
particular image

534
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,600
so just know that uh you know data

535
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
retention may be an issue for you

536
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,918
the next is you know users can turn this

537
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,559
off and i'll tell you if you turn it off

538
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,559
uh

539
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
you can see the warning screen that you

540
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,760
get there to the right

541
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,240
uh that 24 hour time frame is spot on

542
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,760
and there is no data in the database

543
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
once you turn it off

544
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,600
no tables have any data at all but the

545
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
cool thing about it is you can turn it

546
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
back on

547
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,000
and you actually get the 10 previous

548
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,160
days worth of data so if you're

549
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
doing your examination and you know

550
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
you're going through results

551
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,959
and you notice that the digital

552
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
well-being data is a little thin or it's

553
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
just

554
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,559
not there give some consideration about

555
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,960
turning it on

556
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,678
uh you will get 10 days worth of

557
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,360
previous

558
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
previous days worth of data which is

559
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
better than no data now if the phone's

560
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,399
been sitting

561
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,080
in evidence for for three months uh

562
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
waiting for you to get to it

563
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,918
you're not gonna get it it's just gonna

564
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,439
be the 10 previous calendar days so keep

565
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,080
that in mind

566
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,600
the last drawback is is a big one you

567
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
we're not going to see any data on

568
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,959
deleted apps

569
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
once an app is deleted from a phone any

570
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
entry about it in the digital well-being

571
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
database

572
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
is is gone but there are other places

573
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,799
that you can go

574
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,880
on the phone to to determine about you

575
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,639
know was there activity

576
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,919
in a particular app you know we've got

577
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
our usage stats

578
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
and i do want to talk about deleted apps

579
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,320
for a second and uh

580
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
in a little bit of time that i've i've

581
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,000
got left um

582
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,080
there is a a particular uh

583
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,559
feature now with android's called device

584
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,399
personalization services dps

585
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,639
uh and it's fairly new um

586
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
and it is tracking everything that you

587
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
do

588
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,760
uh which is great uh for us from

589
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
examiners you know for for regular

590
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,720
people they might may not feel the same

591
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,159
way but from an examiner standpoint this

592
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,160
is definitely great news

593
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
um this is where it sits in in the file

594
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
system the file path

595
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,080
uh google.android.as which actually

596
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
stands for action services that's what

597
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,399
it was known for

598
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,000
are known as before android 10.

599
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
and you can see on the right that that

600
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,240
is the database that we're after

601
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,760
reflection

602
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,840
underscore gel underscore events

603
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,360
this database is very simple there's

604
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,918
only three tables in it

605
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,439
uh and reflection underscore event is

606
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,760
the one that we're after

607
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,720
if you look in the top blue box you can

608
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
see uh

609
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,640
with twitter twitter was started

610
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
and then twitter i went to my twitter

611
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,360
feed

612
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,239
to look and then the last line in that

613
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,439
blue box is

614
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,440
dm dm activity i went to my dms so

615
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
you can actually see what's going on

616
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,760
inside the app as it's

617
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,320
going on and this makes sense because

618
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,600
dps is designed to learn your habits

619
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,280
and offer contextual uh recommendations

620
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,520
you know based on time of day location

621
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,280
or you know app usage sequence

622
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
this is where the data is coming from

623
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,120
and so you can get a nice

624
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
very good granular level now you're not

625
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,719
going to get stuff like uh

626
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,720
device unlocks and you know stuff's

627
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,120
moved to the background or foreground or

628
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,960
you know stop your pause but you can

629
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,158
definitely see what's going on with

630
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
these apps

631
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,159
now if you if you look a couple of

632
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,799
columns to the right you'll notice

633
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,000
there is a protocol because we are

634
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,240
talking about google and android

635
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,679
there's some protobuf data here the

636
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,080
blobs in the protocol

637
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,799
they are just a replay of what you're

638
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,320
seeing

639
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,400
in the other columns so you'll see your

640
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,360
timestamp you'll see your your package

641
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
id

642
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,479
um but the good thing about the protobuf

643
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,799
data

644
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,640
is that it actually retains data about

645
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,080
activity in deleted apps

646
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,799
which is fantastic right and so just as

647
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,879
an example

648
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,200
uh that top screenshot i've got

649
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,600
highlighted you can see

650
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,919
whatsapp.conversation

651
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,039
i had i was in the chat window and

652
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,679
what's out

653
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,360
so what i did was i deleted whatsapp

654
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,400
waited 24 hours and then pulled the

655
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,959
database again

656
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
and the bottom screenshot is

657
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,280
representing that

658
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,640
and you see the the database entry id

659
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,360
and the timestamp is still there but

660
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,840
i've just got an

661
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,879
entry there for deleted app it's not

662
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,080
very helpful

663
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,120
uh however if you notice the uh

664
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,360
the protoblob is still there which is

665
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,879
which is good because if you run proto c

666
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,280
against it you can see

667
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,559
uh i'm still able to determine what that

668
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,399
entry was what's that

669
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,799
conversation and again the time stamp is

670
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
there there's some other ancillary data

671
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,360
there

672
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,720
as well uh still working on trying to

673
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,080
figure out what those

674
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,159
data points represent uh but the two two

675
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
key takeaways here is that you do still

676
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,960
get your timestamp

677
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,879
and you do still get what uh what

678
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
was going on on that device at that

679
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,720
particular point in time

680
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,559
now there are some limitations to dps as

681
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
well as you can see the user's got some

682
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,678
level of control

683
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,760
over the over deleting the data

684
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,760
including turning dps off

685
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,919
but unlike digital well-being if you

686
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
turn dps off and then turn it back on

687
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,640
it's just going to start recording from

688
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,918
that point you're not going to get any

689
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,240
previous data

690
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,320
the other drawback to this too is that

691
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,000
it's only seen on newer devices so

692
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,320
you know the pixel series has got it the

693
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,120
oneplus series

694
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,399
phones starting with the 7t have got it

695
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,199
and the newer samsung

696
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
phone so the s galaxy s20 and all of its

697
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,080
variants

698
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,600
uh and the newer a series that were

699
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,439
released this year have got

700
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,959
this feature you may not necessarily see

701
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,480
it on older phones but if you've got a

702
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,600
newer phone on your bench

703
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,880
this is an option for you i did write a

704
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
blog post about this

705
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,159
and it's way too much information to

706
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,559
squeeze in this last

707
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,360
minute or two so i'm just i'll refer you

708
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
to the blog post

709
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,918
you can read more about it it's really

710
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,120
interesting i'm hoping it'll it'll show

711
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
up in more phones

712
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:23,360
as we go on with that i'm going to turn

713
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:25,280
it over to alexis

714
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,879
alex i can't hear you i'm not sure if

715
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,960
anyone else can no no

716
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,240
it was my fault okay you're good it was

717
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,679
my fault i i

718
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,760
so everybody knows i got my kids you

719
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,720
know downstairs and they're a little bit

720
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,840
rowdy so i put the mute on yeah no i was

721
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
saying that

722
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,918
i think at this point pretty obvious how

723
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,039
how uh relevant this information is for

724
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,960
your cases right

725
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,000
when you get this visibility into what

726
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,520
the user and the apps you know

727
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
the user was doing through the apps

728
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,559
right so my part

729
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,158
it's the uh the implementation let me

730
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,639
see if i can um

731
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,840
what am i doing around here so i can

732
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,320
have you have control you still have

733
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,360
control

734
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,399
josh if you have control okay then go

735
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,840
go uh go to the

736
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,600
right after you're after the limitations

737
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,199
so be go back a couple more

738
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,039
okay there you go i just gave you

739
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
control so you should be able to do that

740
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,279
i'm sorry

741
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,640
oh no worries all right

742
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,799
that was me right perfect all right so

743
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,840
um the implementation of the of the

744
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,080
research that

745
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,320
josh just just described to you right

746
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,199
and where i did that with a tool that uh

747
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,240
that i developed with geography we're

748
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,360
co-authors of

749
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,120
a leap and the community um and i will

750
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,279
take this opportunity to let you know

751
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,399
quickly the work everybody has done in

752
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,880
this tool

753
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
this tool is for parsing android

754
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
artifacts called a-leap you see the

755
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,279
title right there on the slides and

756
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
there's a sister

757
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,679
uh python series of scripts called i

758
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,400
leap for ios

759
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,039
and it's a product of yogesh's work my

760
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,520
work

761
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,279
researchers testers a lot of the

762
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,799
research that edward has done

763
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,320
heather has also done is it's been

764
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
implemented in the tool as you can see

765
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,559
here

766
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,840
you will see josh's research also

767
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,399
implemented in the tool

768
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,279
and this is the gui interface it's also

769
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,720
command line

770
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,640
which is pretty useful because you're

771
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,400
able to scale

772
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,600
the the the an oracle state parsing

773
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,400
uh these artifacts right um and i use

774
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,158
this a lot

775
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,480
when i have let's say i receive 50

776
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,240
phones i use a leap after i do my

777
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,080
imaging as a triage tool

778
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,000
and then i can pinpoint which phone i

779
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,639
need to do further or deeper analysis

780
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,520
with a

781
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,080
heavier set tool okay so what you see

782
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,799
here on the

783
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,000
gui is you have to select first the type

784
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,320
of extraction

785
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
as josh mentioned to be able to have the

786
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,840
visibility into the personalization

787
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,840
services and the well-being

788
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,480
yeah it's not going to work with a

789
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,240
android backup you need to have actual

790
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,159
you know file system full file system

791
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,159
access or physical access

792
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,039
okay and the file formats that ali

793
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,440
is able to parse is uh either zip files

794
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,240
an

795
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,039
image in a zip file tar file or a

796
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
logical

797
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,200
extraction which is a fancy way of

798
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,760
saying that you know a folder with

799
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,760
all the files in it in the proper pass

800
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,520
from the extraction okay

801
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,360
and then you select the output folder

802
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,639
where you want your results to land

803
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
on the left side of the screen you will

804
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,440
see all the artifacts that are supported

805
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,399
you can select them all

806
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,799
i'll deselect them all usually leave

807
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,520
them all on because parsing is pretty

808
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,720
quick takes

809
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,799
five minutes um again it's a triage

810
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,799
concept that this tool has okay

811
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,120
oh i hit it twice i apologize so within

812
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,279
the interface you will see there uh

813
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,239
for the well-being uh three artifacts

814
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,440
the well-being as

815
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,559
uh improper and then i extracted

816
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,679
the well-being um urls so that way you

817
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,080
don't have to fish them

818
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,000
from the results from the well-being

819
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,600
parsing right which is still there but

820
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,600
if you want only the urls you can also

821
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,240
just look at that uh

822
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,918
parse from that artifact and then

823
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,799
information about the well-being account

824
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,120
which is tied

825
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,279
to uh the user of the phone the the

826
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,879
account of the user of the phone okay

827
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,960
if you want to download a leap and give

828
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,240
it a shot the link is right there

829
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,559
at my github again it's python 3 all the

830
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,679
dependencies you can install using

831
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,879
our pip requirements

832
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
if that's kind of like i don't know what

833
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
you're talking about don't worry in a

834
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,240
few slides i'll have a link

835
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,840
that will give you instructions and

836
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,880
video instructions how to do all these

837
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,918
things okay so

838
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,919
you know we got you

839
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
all right so after the person is done

840
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,120
you'll see your report on the left side

841
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,279
you'll see your artifacts

842
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,879
and on the right side the different

843
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,039
reports from those artifacts

844
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,880
in this case i did a full run so you can

845
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,559
see their accounts call logs chrome

846
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,960
history a whole bunch of stuff

847
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
um there's also the on the center you

848
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,360
see there on the screen

849
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,039
the logs that indicates um if there was

850
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,879
any issues with any parsing

851
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,080
and what type of files were parsed and

852
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,760
where they are located

853
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,960
okay these are the categories that you

854
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
will look for when you're interested in

855
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
well-being

856
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,720
using this tool you're going to go to

857
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
the wellbeing category and there you'll

858
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,279
see account data the events and the url

859
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,440
events

860
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,440
and personalization services under app

861
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,399
this is an example of how the well-being

862
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
report looks

863
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,039
um it does the time conversion for you

864
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,880
so it's super super nice

865
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,320
and also shows the package id and then

866
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,919
the different event types

867
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,559
you will see there on the right side a

868
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,559
search bar so as you type

869
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,678
it will uh it will change and give you

870
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,480
the results you need so if you're

871
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,320
interested

872
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,679
in a particular bundle id which we'll

873
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,120
show you in a second like worker

874
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,960
then you can put wicker there and it

875
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,439
will only show you

876
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
uh relevance to wicker you can also sort

877
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,080
by columns

878
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,679
if it need be and at this point

879
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,600
particularly this screen show you 15

880
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,399
entries but you can select

881
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
the show entries uh drop down and select

882
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,840
all

883
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,000
or just you use the page and age to tab

884
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,678
imagination if i'm saying that correctly

885
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,520
paginate it hopefully i said it right um

886
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,880
so you can go through it page by page

887
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,399
um if you want you decide to do so

888
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,320
now here's a bit more information right

889
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,879
you see here like the ingur

890
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,480
application being worked really

891
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
important i'm working off

892
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,520
the fantastic images that josh has

893
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,158
created for us

894
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,799
he has uh has shared with the community

895
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,240
android

896
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,600
and ios images and a lot of my recent

897
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,600
research i will say all my recent

898
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,320
research is coming from analyzing those

899
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,520
images

900
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,799
so i highly encourage you to download

901
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
josh's images that are really well

902
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
documented

903
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,120
so when he says well what happened at

904
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,840
this time i was chatting or doing this

905
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,399
or that

906
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,039
he has a documentation that says what he

907
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,039
was doing

908
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,080
at what time and and if it's a chat what

909
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,480
the chat said

910
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,360
so that way as you're validating your

911
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,200
your research

912
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,199
you can use that it's super useful again

913
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,120
josh i have to thank you

914
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,799
i can i can't thank you enough all right

915
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,479
um here's the example of wicker so if

916
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,000
you do a search for worker it only

917
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,799
limits that search for worker and then

918
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,360
you can really

919
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,879
narrow down on the different activity

920
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,678
and you will say well wicker is kind of

921
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,200
hard to get to

922
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,760
you know i might not be able to decode

923
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,799
it and i get that at the same time just

924
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,440
even knowing when

925
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,720
the application was used at what times

926
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,320
to develop a pattern

927
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,919
helps it will definitely help you it

928
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,360
might just corroborate let's say you

929
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,000
work in a criminal case it might just

930
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
corroborate

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
a witness statement right you might not

932
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,840
have the content of the wicker chat

933
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,360
but if the activity matches the patterns

934
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,080
that say a witness tells you

935
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,918
that really helps you know corroborate

936
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
that and i'll give you some examples of

937
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,159
how sometimes not having the full chat

938
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,799
but if you have all this ancillary data

939
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
helps build that picture and something

940
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,279
that i've

941
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,279
heard from um eric zimmerman

942
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,120
a bunch of times is how different

943
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,559
artifacts together they all

944
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,239
build this picture right they kind of

945
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,200
complement each other to actually let us

946
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
know what's going on

947
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,760
you gotta remember that what happens in

948
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,080
the digital world is a reflection

949
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,600
of the real world right and we need to

950
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,000
find where that interface lies

951
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,600
you'll see here the url events and it's

952
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,880
pretty neat you have their the package

953
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,799
name and then the website

954
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,159
it's like like josh was saying it's the

955
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,559
top domains

956
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,919
um also really useful to kind of just be

957
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,918
able to browse that real quickly

958
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,399
here's how the implementation from the

959
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,880
usage apps works

960
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,279
um again it's all it's all included in a

961
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,760
leap i should also say that

962
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,760
ios has a similar kind of functionality

963
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
within within screen time

964
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,039
uh i would say interaction c and

965
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,960
knowledge c databases

966
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,480
it's out of scope i just wanted to to

967
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,799
mention that because

968
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,799
their uh i leap also does that type of

969
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,320
analysis for you which is a sister

970
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,639
script collection from a leap that and i

971
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,678
leap

972
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,279
again is it's uh up for uh an award so

973
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,159
please please vote

974
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,440
right um services report notice this

975
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,279
part is the part that's most

976
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,559
interesting to me after the package name

977
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,320
you can see

978
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,918
pretty much good detail of what module

979
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,439
was being accessed if you're chatting it

980
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,240
would say private chat activity

981
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,000
right if you're at the dashboard link at

982
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,440
the top level of the app it will say yes

983
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,440
it will say so right it will take

984
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
research on your part to confirm what

985
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
the uh

986
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,480
what the methods are being used right

987
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,120
but still even if you don't get the

988
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,159
content

989
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,639
you can get that something that i did

990
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,200
and recently and i'm gonna go quickly

991
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,200
because time has is running out

992
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,039
um let me show you this real quickly

993
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,760
here's an example of deleted apps

994
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,519
as josh explained and what what the

995
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,600
event was for the application again a

996
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,440
lot of detail sometimes we just get

997
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,719
an event that the app was deleted here

998
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
you know it's deleted but you actually

999
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,120
figured out

1000
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,479
what it was doing at that particular

1001
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,039
time

1002
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,679
now the thing i want to get to um first

1003
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,200

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,799
twitter they do great research they do

1010
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,399
great sharing

1011
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,399
most some of them you know some of them

1012
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:02,959
you don't please do follow them

1013
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,479
and if you want to understand how a leap

1014
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,799
works how to install how to run it or

1015
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,880
even how to develop artifacts for it

1016
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,200
you can go to the the resource page in

1017
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,559
my blog and and it will it will

1018
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,799
it will show you that and you can reach

1019
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,559
out to me as well one thing that i

1020
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,320
did not have on my slides because i came

1021
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,639
up with it before

1022
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,918
uh the date the time to turn our slides

1023
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
in

1024
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,840
timelining i thank sarah edwards she was

1025
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,960
the inspiration for it and her apollo

1026
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,399
tool

1027
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,399
is super in this last thing it's super

1028
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,518
important because the timelining

1029
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,360
really puts um context from other

1030
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,039
artifacts for example and i don't have a

1031
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,199
i cannot show you but i'll quickly

1032
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,600
describe it you can have well-being

1033
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,240
telling you well an activity was paused

1034
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,799
or an activity was resumed right

1035
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,360
usage stats at that same time maybe a

1036
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,320
second

1037
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,840
right after tells you that that app was

1038
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,279
moved to the background right so you

1039
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,199
know the activity paused

1040
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,880
now you know by combining it with usage

1041
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,000
stats that is because it was moved to

1042
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
the background right

1043
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,200
and then it tells you then therefore the

1044
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,200
activity was stopped right

1045
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
and then users just tell you well you

1046
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
know screen was not interactive at that

1047
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,560
point right so you

1048
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,359
start building more detail when you

1049
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,759
combine

1050
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,719
well-being personalization services and

1051
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,480
use of stats

1052
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,399
sometimes the events are mirrored to

1053
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,918
each other in a sense but sometimes it

1054
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,638
just provides more context

1055
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,520
to exactly what was happening with with

1056
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,599
the app

1057
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,520
this is a the the tool creates a sqlite

1058
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,879
database with all the timelining from

1059
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,918
all the artifacts that have

1060
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,359
a timestamp on them so please do check

1061
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:36,078
that out it will be at the root

1062
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,960
of the uh the script uh folder

1063
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
and that's all all we got um again this

1064
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
is our

1065
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,879
how you can reach out to us in part in

1066
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,399
regards to the implementation if you

1067
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,239
have any something that you want to

1068
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,759
me to look at or you know make a parser

1069
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,040
for or help you out in the parts that

1070
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
you're working on

1071
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,040
feel feel free to reach out to me and

no now we can i can hear you heather i

1076
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,400
know this can't hear you heather

1077
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,839
it's because i muted myself

1078
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
you seriously finished on perfect time

1079
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,680
um what i tried to do while you were

1080
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,640
talking

1081
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:19,919
i pinned your images josh i pinned your

1082
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,520
um blog that you wrote okay i

1083
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,280
pinned barack's blog on celebrate

1084
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,480
and i pinned a leap and i pinned the

1085
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,079
forecast

1086
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,520
award so i tried to pin all the things

1087
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,839
as you were mentioning it to

1088
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,280
track to and your channel i also pinned

1089
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,359
some questions

1090
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
that were asked in there um so you may

1091
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,078
want to take a look there was a really

1092
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,839
good one i forget which

1093
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,599
channel it was in but it was about the

1094
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,640
type of acquisition that you need in

1095
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,079
order to get digital well-being

1096
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,240
right so you're you're going to at least

1097
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,320
need to get a file system

1098
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,160
uh sometimes the file system acquisition

1099
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
and i tested this both on

1100
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,919
you fed and axiom uh but you know

1101
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,440
again it just depends on the extraction

1102
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,760
capabilities of your tools and as we

1103
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,720
know

1104
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,320
android phones pose a particular problem

1105
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,480
uh because of how

1106
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,680
uh different handset manufacturers

1107
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,599
implement android

1108
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,720
right the different software hardware

1109
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,800
combinations

1110
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,919
you know it's just it makes it quite a

1111
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,960
bit of a headache

1112
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,720
as far as trying to to figure out if a

1113
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,040
you know particular tool can extract

1114
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,480
from this particular device but

1115
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,640
at least the file system great

1116
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,000
thank you both and i didn't want to chop

1117
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
like chime in and answer

1118
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,920
all the things but that was a good one i

1119
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
thought it would be nice to hear and you

1120
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,880
were answering things on the fly as

1121
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,240
people were typing it it's hilarious

1122
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
it's like you were reading the chat

1123
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,680
channel

1124
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,040
it was amazing i tried to anticipate

1125
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,720
what kind of questions i would have from

1126
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:55,839
an examiner's standpoint and

1127
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:55,839
it made sure that those got in there

1128
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,599
you
