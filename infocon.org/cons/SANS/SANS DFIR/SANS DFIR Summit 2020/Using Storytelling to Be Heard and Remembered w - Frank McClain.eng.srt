1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,429
[Music]

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,400
unless we are able to tell our stories

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
does our work actually occur i'll leave

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,799
you with that uh that postulation will

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
we uh kick you off take it away frank

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,640
all right over the next 10 minutes i'm

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,000
going to be talking about the importance

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
of telling stories

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
uh and so realistically the the title

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,759
says it all

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,680
um so i think we're done thanks for

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,040
coming bye-bye

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,559
okay okay maybe maybe not quite

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,920
um first a little about me

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,760
in case you didn't see yesterday and

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,600
i spent several years doing digital

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
forensics and incident response

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
consulting

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
where i got to talk to lawyers a lot i

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,199
moved from there to corporate

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
in financial services i ran our security

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,160
operations team

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,199
for several years i got to talk to

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,839
lawyers

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,438
a lot i got to talk to business leaders

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,080
c-level

27
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,960
hr and and now i'm with red canary and i

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,720
lead our search

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,360
training program so from past experience

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,280
trying to explain technical concepts to

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
non-technical people

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720
a lot of that translates over into my

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,280
current role

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
where i also get to work with sales

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
staff and

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,320
others that are in non-technical or

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
different type of technical

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,758
roles to help them understand how our

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
detection process

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:43,200
works and believe it or not this

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,200
often involves telling stories

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,199
okay so what uh what

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,560
happens when you take a bunch of

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,759
as our our cert vp

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,399
affectionately says naval gazers right

46
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,040
and and he's one of us so he gets to say

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
that

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
um but what happens when you get a bunch

49
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
of us together in a room

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,758
and then the answer is pretty much

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
nothing

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,760
i mean if we know somebody in the room

53
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,000
we may go talk to them

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
and if enough of us know the same person

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
or you know some of the same people an

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,920
actual conversation may occur

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,399
with with many people but that's when

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,839
we're with our tribe

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,480
right what do we do when we want to

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,440
share information with others

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
and how about others that are not our

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
tribe

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,720
others who are not technical like

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
lawyers like business leaders what do we

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,800
do

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,238
in those types of situations

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,519
now it's probably not etymologically

68
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,440
sound

69
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,360
but i've been told that there's a reason

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,519
that history

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,080
has story in it

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,040
using stories to share information

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,400
occurrences

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,720
and relate to one another as humans

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,480
has been a core part of every culture

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
throughout

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,720
well history

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,599
and this is certainly anthropologically

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,519
sound

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,399
there i've i've gotten my quota of big

81
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,560
words out of the way for today

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,440
but we've we've drifted away from this

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
concept of

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,359
of storytelling to focus more on

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,720
science with stats with numbers with

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
methods

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,159
and and process rather than

88
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,518
relationships is

89
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:44,319
king and history

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,319
has become a dull and boring textbook

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,120
now nigel tranter who i list

92
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,720
here uh is a scottish author

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,840
he mostly historical novels but

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:03,120
but just novelizing history right not

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,480
not not uh novels from a standpoint of

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,879
fiction but from making history

97
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
interesting making it passionate making

98
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,480
it exciting rather than dry and boring

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
he really felt like that was important

100
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
history is the story of our lives of

101
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
nations and it's something to be

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,918
experienced

103
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,919
something to be felt

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,160
and with that we're going to go back

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
in time to highlight a couple of talks

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
from the

107
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,080
sands d for summit of 2017.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,799
now i was there at the summit in person

109
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
um i'm one of the people that kind of

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
got mentioned earlier i guess that like

111
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,639
i'm always there right

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,120
that's that's the the conference that i

113
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,000
live

114
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,199
to go to every year and i have about 150

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,600
lines of notes

116
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
from that two-day conference uh fred

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
kaplan gave the keynote

118
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
about dark territory it was really

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,159
incredible

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,880
some amazing research was shared and

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,320
i'm either using or have used tools that

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,719
were presented about

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,080
there but those aren't the things that

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
stood out to me

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,240
right we're now three years later

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,360
and there's two talks that i still

127
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
remember

128
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
uh one jessica hyde and brian moran gave

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,479
a talk called

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
amazon alexa are you skynet and tim ball

131
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,000
gave a talk called

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,520
the forensics of plagiarism a case study

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,680
in cheating

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,080
i want to showcase these because they

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,000
used elements of storytelling

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
and as a result they've stuck with me

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
more than any other talk at that

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,320
conference

139
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,960
starting off brian and jessica had a

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
theme

141
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,560
and for the the sharp eyes there you see

142
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,599
lee whitfield lurking in the background

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,800
grinning kind of maniacally

144
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,039
perhaps anyway um

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,919
i know these people right they're part

146
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,919
of my tribe

147
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,639
brian and jessica are very high energy

148
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,520
engaging speakers they're popular within

149
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,360
the community

150
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
and they're well known and well liked by

151
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
many

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,680
either one on their own gives a great

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,840
talk

154
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,039
together it's a thing of legends

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,159
but this talk

156
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,479
wasn't very much for me

157
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
right i don't mean that in a negative

158
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,318
way it was just

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
the the topic of it it was not that

160
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,919
applicable

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,880
uh for my line of work for the the type

162
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:47,198
of research that i do

163
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,159
um so it from that perspective it wasn't

164
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,319
that much of an interest although it did

165
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,919
do more to convince me that i don't want

166
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,080
iot in my home but

167
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
brian told a story

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,638
and i think this picture says it all

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,039
right

170
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,960
most people sit on a couch brian

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,759
apparently stands on the couch

172
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,120
on the back of the couch to turn off a

173
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,800
light

174
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
and and this was early on in the

175
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,000
presentation right this kind of set the

176
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
stage for everything else

177
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
now as it as it turns out that

178
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,840
aforementioned light was his

179
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,160
impetus for going iot

180
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,359
apparently it was over a stairwell over

181
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,440
a drop to impending doom

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
and and maybe that doesn't sound like a

183
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,160
huge deal but as brian noted in the talk

184
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,039
he was concerned about a scenario

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
in which he might have consumed too much

186
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,479
alcohol

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,479
put on a horse head mask and an adult

188
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,159
lego unikitty onesie

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,240
and climbed up on the couch to turn off

190
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
the light

191
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,919
okay maybe i added the mask and the

192
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,879
onesie for effect

193
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:01,520
but if you know brian you know it's not

194
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,199
entirely out of the question

195
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,840
the point is that light is what got him

196
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,599
started on the path and once he was

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,599
putting in smart bulbs he wanted to

198
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,719
figure out what information might be

199
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
collected

200
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,520
stored potentially exposed by the

201
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
controlling applications

202
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,000
and that led to collaboration and

203
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,639
research that was shared in this talk

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
and i remember that even though note

205
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
like i said

206
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,120
this talk the topic wasn't

207
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,000
a thing for me it wasn't an interesting

208
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,159
thing

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,440
but him sharing that story

210
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,838
is what made it memorable even years

211
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,839
later

212
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,199
now this is the title slide from the

213
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
the next example and as you can see it

214
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
looks

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
nothing like the previous one for one

216
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,439
thing there's

217
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,800
no liquid field this has the look

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,640
and feel of a white paper

219
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,279
right now i don't know tim ball

220
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,080
well i didn't know him at all prior to

221
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
the conference

222
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,760
he's not someone that i'd ever met or

223
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,120
come across because you know like i've

224
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,519
met and come across everybody in the

225
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,959
world

226
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,680
right um and i say that just to point

227
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,959
out that i

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,120
didn't already have you know that that

229
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,959
affiliation that affinity for him is for

230
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,920
jessica and brian

231
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
his speaking style was very different it

232
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,800
was much more serious

233
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,439
straightforward perhaps even dry a

234
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,079
little bit at least in comparison

235
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
and maybe that's to be expected you know

236
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
since he was a

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,160
college professor although it turns out

238
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
he hadn't been in academia very long

239
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,880
at that time

240
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,480
tim said that one thing he'd learned in

241
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,440
his short time at that point

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,200
teaching college was that cheating was

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
rather common

244
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,600
now that's that's pretty disappointing

245
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:05,440
but i guess it stands to reason

246
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,959
people look for the easy way out

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,079
anyway he told a story about

248
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,680
a student an actual student real

249
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,680
you know real life scenario

250
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,279
in a computer forensics class that's

251
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
right

252
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,839
a computer forensics class that got

253
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,959
that cheated and got caught

254
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,800
as it turns out colleges universities

255
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,839
they have ways to catch this type of

256
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,800
thing and using a forensic approach

257
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,800
kim was able to prove the activity the

258
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
student tried to fight it

259
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
even got parents involved but with no

260
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,720
joy

261
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
and so just as with the alexa talk it

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
told a story

263
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,880
that helped relate to other humans and

264
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
through that story it shared information

265
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,360
and built connections

266
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,719
and became memorable not necessarily

267
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,839
because of the content

268
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
or the topic but because of the story

269
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,119
so what can you do if you're one of the

270
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
naval gazers

271
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,959
you're not comfortable speaking in front

272
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,000
of others especially

273
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,599
those outside your tribe

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,640
think about ways that you can share

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,360
information in a story format

276
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,560
instead of trying to just present dry

277
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
facts

278
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,399
create a storyline in which those facts

279
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
are key

280
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,600
show it to your audience whether that's

281
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,399
other geeks

282
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
business leaders lawyers or non-work

283
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,000
friends who typically just

284
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,519
glaze over when you start to talk about

285
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,920
your day

286
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,640
it's it's about the experience of life

287
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,719
and we can

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,720
all share that i think it was um

289
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:55,599
jim's talk yesterday

290
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,560
he talked about his story of try try

291
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
again

292
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,399
with this one malware sample right

293
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,839
that's the kind of thing that we're

294
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,279
talking about

295
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
you can share a story it doesn't have to

296
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,880
be perfect

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,320
you don't have to have all the answers

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,399
but it's the experience

299
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,519
and it's relating that experience to

300
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,720
other people

301
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,079
it becomes important the more you do it

302
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,279
the better you get at it all right so

303
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
reference links

304
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,880
um you know for for some of the stuff

305
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,639
here

306
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
pointing back to the sans archive and

307
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,160
whatnot um

308
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
and just a little article that i thought

309
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
was interesting about storytelling and

310
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,399
kind of the importance to

311
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,360
society on that and

312
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:53,839
that's it so thank you all very much and

313
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:53,839
i hope you enjoyed it

314
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
you
