1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
wasn't enough of a challenge so I'm

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,199
actually going to take a decade of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,269
financial hacks and condense that into

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,320
six minutes ok good intro slide here

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:21,240
will build that out the only real key

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,630
point here is that in any breach or any

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,799
hack you're in a Time battle quicker you

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,679
can detect it the less damage there will

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,559
be the less exfiltration the less loss

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,930
of sensitive data so I'm going to take

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,699
two packs about eight years apart and

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:46,620
what you're going to see is eerily

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,440
similar you're going to see the breach

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,169
the reconnaissance and then you're going

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,079
to see the hackers start testing and

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,559
evolving malware to come up with a

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,489
production system the only difference

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,250
between these two hacks is basically the

19
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,110
technology the malware that they use but

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,289
other than that they're going to look

21
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:17,460
eerily similar ok we'll go ahead and

22
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,000
build this one out first-half starts in

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,158
july the hackers found someone encrypted

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,009
data did a massive download digestive

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,340
that came back in november and picked up

26
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,700
with the exact date that the last

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,579
download stopped but now the data was

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,460
all improved either masked or encrypted

29
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,399
so they had to do something different to

30
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,970
get the value so they came back in May

31
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,360
and now started testing a series of

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,470
sniffers trying to get to something that

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,960
would cap

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,520
the unencrypted transactions as they're

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,080
flowing through through the processor

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,220
prior to being authorized by the bank

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,200
and then incur fit for storage and in

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,449
retrospect when you go back and do the

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,180
forensics you can see the hackers

40
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:15,299
uploading a new sniffer every every

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,580
couple of days they they tried sniffers

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,860
that drop two files they actually even

43
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:23,220
try to sniff her for a while that

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,860
streamed the data out of the network but

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,130
that was too hard to manage so finally

46
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,160
you see in October they get to what we

47
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:36,000
call a production system he now had a

48
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,549
very efficient sniffer he turned the

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,670
sniffer on connected to a file collect

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,780
credit cards for three days come back I

51
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,420
want it late almost on a production

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,680
schedule three days later turn to steph

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:57,810
rothe full file exfiltrated and

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:00,300
connected to a new sticker we contested

55
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,090
the breach ironically from tip and

56
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,820
secret service request we kept this

57
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:10,080
hacker alive in the network for 19 days

58
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,780
obviously couldn't let him keep

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,269
downloading credit cards so we ran an

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,470
algorithm fortunately we knew his

61
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,420
download schedule so we ran an algorithm

62
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,850
about a half hour to an hour before he

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,119
came in a download that changed all the

64
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,489
credit cards still past lunch Jack's so

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,650
they still look valid to him he never

66
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,780
knew we were dealing with his credit

67
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,930
cards but that's not above them the

68
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,750
message the real message here is if you

69
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,470
don't detect the hackers in your network

70
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:46,560
if you give them two three four five six

71
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,530
months they won't just do periodic

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:57,750
downloads they'll go into a production

73
00:03:49,530 --> 00:04:00,830
mode okay next one so this one is a much

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,830
more recent breach

75
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:08,700
but you see essentially the same pattern

76
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,920
January the intruders get in these guys

77
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:14,579
were so bold that they didn't even

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,488
bother installing back doors for about

79
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,209
two weeks what they did though was they

80
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:24,210
immediately install the memory scraper

81
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,830
they needed to get at the processes in

82
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,049
the servers that were handling and

83
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,940
credit cards you know during that brief

84
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,800
moment that the carbs decrypted

85
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,000
processed re-encrypted for transmission

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,130
so they started playing with

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,220
developmental scrapers in February in

88
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:48,570
June it went to a another generation of

89
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,730
developmental scrapers in December there

90
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,190
now and they're running a little bit

91
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:56,730
behind schedule because frankly these

92
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,910
guys typically are aiming for October

93
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,300
and really November and December they

94
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,070
want the prime Christmas shopping season

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,040
that's that's what credit card volume

96
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,990
just goes spikes amazingly now they were

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,840
running a little behind schedule they

98
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,330
got their developmental three scraper in

99
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,219
place worked pretty good so they

100
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:22,020
immediately went to generation one in

101
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,810
December and that's shortly after that

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,400
in January like

103
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:31,340
to generation to again this is why

104
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,489
network security monitoring is so

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,830
absolutely critical because if you could

106
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,230
have caught them at any point during

107
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,820
that installation phase you could have

108
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:45,970
killed them before you started losing

109
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,969
big time Daniel thank you
