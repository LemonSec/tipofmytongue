1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,170
I'm very briefly about killing killing

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,000
check your exploits there we go yes talk

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,639
about reading 15 or nonsense so

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,809
everybody's like oh doh hackers refer

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,099
your networks they're funny

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,189
reconnaissance then they eventually

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,020
reach us what do we do now well we can

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,220
look for one stage of the attack I

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,019
printed this isn't going to cover

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,330
everything but it's a start so you have

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,979
some evil hacker and maybe he's probing

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,379
your external web interface what are

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,500
they looking for email addresses right

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,570
maybe very important people with inside

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,269
the organization maybe administrators so

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,040
they can jump to executives your they're

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,840
looking for personal information so they

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,789
can target people effectively maybe

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,340
they're looking for technical documents

20
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,809
oh how can I craft this phishing email

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,309
to look legitimate like it's coming from

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,399
this company so i can send it to a

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,349
partner hey or basic security issues oh

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,190
they're running a vulnerable immersion

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,920
Apache or not so what can you infer from

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,210
this type of activity well location

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,729
right you have geoip pretty simple not

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,259
entirely accurate but you've got you can

29
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,240
infer sometimes the software that

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,049
they're using right is it a specifically

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,949
crafted program is it a web browser w

32
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,720
get curl maybe their motivation if

33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,049
they're looking for email addresses and

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,610
very specific key business terms maybe

35
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,680
it's a precursor to the targeted attack

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,500
right maybe it's precursor the fishing

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,740
and the level of sophistication so kind

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,689
of judging off location software and

39
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,539
potentially motivation you can say well

40
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,398
this is probably more sophisticated than

41
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,259
this other guy that I detected a week

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,820
ago who just ran a Google spring or the

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,220
script everything from me so what type

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,798
of information can a web browser leave

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,530
I'm sure some of you have heard of the

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,200
Panopto lake from eff pretty cool to go

47
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,299
to website and says hey congratulations

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,250
your browser is uniquely printable to

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,970
you know one out of three

50
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,288
ridiculous like that likes but you don't

51
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,240
have that in your environment you're not

52
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:14,609
going to get bad guys to click on it so

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,950
what can you do you can look the referer

54
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,230
header where did they come from if one's

55
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,730
not they are and chances are committing

56
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,609
here potentially good indicator of

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,780
spring you look at Google analytic

58
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,970
cookies if you're writing in within your

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,320
organization sometimes the fun exercises

60
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,280
look at outbound Google analytical

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,739
pieces and see what your users are

62
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,770
searching for you can look at the user

63
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,870
agent oh look it's Firefox writer to

64
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,150
Mozilla or study you get or its curl you

65
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,390
look at the request structure what are

66
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,220
the orders of the HTTP headers oh wait a

67
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,690
second that doesn't look like Firefox

68
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,890
but they're telling me inspire fun if

69
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,690
you can run something custom in there

70
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,839
making from user agent versions and you

71
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,390
can look at Club information always

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
possible to fake all of this information

73
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,000
people rarely do with a reconnaissance

74
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,640
phase because they feel fairly certain

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,989
nobody's looking for it so one of the

76
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,820
things you can look at it and refer is

77
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,130
search engines guess what there's a lot

78
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,810
of them right it will tell you sometimes

79
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,400
the language that the web browser is

80
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,489
using you can infer the language that

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,989
the person speaks they're using a

82
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,120
language specific version of Google or

83
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,830
something like that or something like

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,090
index how many people in your use the

85
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,890
index and current result set are they

86
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,600
got me 100 of the page of Google results

87
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:29,458
anybody go that far no how do automated

88
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,030
you look at cookies who let I cookies

89
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,680
are awesome right you can get campaign

90
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,060
so if someone has a specific email

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,290
campaign that will show up you can look

92
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,870
at the source whether it is email

93
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,910
organic the search engine you can look

94
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,959
at the medium look at the content and

95
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,090
more important you can look at the

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,130
keywords what searches did they put in

97
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,549
the beginning of their web browsing

98
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,810
session that eventually got them to you

99
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,820
so maybe if you see something with

100
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,320
partner information in it you wait a

101
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,640
second it went there and now they're

102
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,290
looking at being Oh talk a little bit

103
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,429
about web browsers right user agent you

104
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,129
can again for

105
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,510
language of the system the request

106
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,890
rusher provisions additional system

107
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,750
information some of them illegally

108
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,839
screen resolution and plug-in data that

109
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,649
kind of stuff so you can really get kind

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,988
of this Precog minority report style go

111
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,849
hey I know this is going to happen

112
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,400
before it even happens there's a couple

113
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,509
of brief examples the top refer pulled

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,508
up calmed NHK right so native language

115
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:33,900
refer probably maybe speaks English

116
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:36,330
maybe as a second language there you

117
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,429
know on the 10th club for the first page

118
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,609
numbers hadn't read and they're looking

119
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,639
for some some stress some string

120
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,669
marketing reports maybe it's interesting

121
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,810
maybe it's not the second one is a

122
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,330
little bit more interesting they're

123
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,699
actually looking for business that it

124
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,219
contains yahoo or gmail or hotmail com

125
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:00,599
which doesn't include the phrase spammer

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,220
scam guess what you know harvested on

127
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:04,530
the bottom you've got this other kind of

128
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,820
full request and just kind of by looking

129
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,820
at it initially I would say yeah

130
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,090
probably his firebox will the language

131
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,760
that it prefers or remaining okay so now

132
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,619
we know maybe a Romanian Romanian native

133
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,260
language to here and then at the bottom

134
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,870
you can seize are searching for excel

135
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,250
file types with term sales or marketing

136
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,500
or contact list or email write an

137
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,199
all-american campaign seems very very

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,360
specific and when you begin to see

139
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,430
things like file type or a URL or in

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,560
header wow they're really really looking

141
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,909
for something that really you know I

142
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,039
just care about so that's reconstructing

143
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,449
in a nutshell and at the end I've got a

144
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,190
couple results if you guys really want

145
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:49,190
to dissect Google
