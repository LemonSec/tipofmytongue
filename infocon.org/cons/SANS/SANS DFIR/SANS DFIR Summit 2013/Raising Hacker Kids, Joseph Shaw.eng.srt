1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
it talks i was actually ballin told that

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,930
i was going to be speaking so that

3
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,460
you'll notice that i have a my topic

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,019
is not you know pregnancy-related

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,269
however i think it's a very important

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,160
top it needs to be given and i'll be

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,509
giving it in the full hour length of Der

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:24,210
Beek on this September in Louisville so

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:26,189
my name is Joseph and I'm a hacker did

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,949
someone because someone to say hi Joseph

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,660
but anyway I'm a hacker and I mean that

12
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,920
the traditional sense I'm not talking

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,809
about ponen systems though I've

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,260
certainly done that professionally you

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:45,030
know but I believe that it's important

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,260
to understand technology from a very low

17
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,640
level I believe you need to have an

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,710
in-depth understanding of it and I would

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,930
love that sort of stuff so the top of my

20
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,059
 is raising hacker kids for good or

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,390
for awesome now in the past couple years

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,190
we have had a trend in the infosec

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,050
community where we started actually have

24
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,390
events for kids you've got at kids gone

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,610
you've got DEFCON kids now I have

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,240
opinions on one of those that are very

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,710
strong haha and the reason is toby is

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,839
important to me is because these are

29
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,820
three quarters of my children yes three

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,619
quarters when I for those of you who are

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,298
fraction challenge that means that I

32
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,380
have eight children ranging in age from

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,750
14 all the way down into to 20 month old

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:30,329
twins who are on this picture that's our

35
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,700
class photo for 2012 so one of the

36
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,589
things that I really worry about is that

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,970
one hackers very word right but I want

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,520
to raise hacker children does that mean

39
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,320
I want my children to have that in-depth

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,789
understanding of Technology I want them

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,189
to understand that we live in a world

42
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,350
where technology is ubiquitous computers

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,210
are connected to our lives the types of

44
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,610
technology would carry on ourselves cell

45
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,048
phones our laptops iPads tablet devices

46
00:01:52,610 --> 00:02:00,409
it's everywhere it's a part of our daily

47
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:03,930
lives and most the underlying sort of

48
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,700
mindset is that because recent

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,079
generations use so much technology but

50
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,300
they understand how it works they don't

51
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,579
I work with Cub Scouts workers

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,110
scales they use it they're comfortable

53
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,580
with it but they have no idea how the

54
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,030
underlying technologies works they don't

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,410
understand they're being trapped in gps

56
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,930
they understand that all that text all

57
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,390
those text messages persist and most

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,130
people don't so I want my children to

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,989
understand that so I do things like I

60
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,180
could teach them out a program I believe

61
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,220
that idle hands are definitely the

62
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,800
devil's playground and to illustrate

63
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,270
this point in a non technical way back

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,310
in the 90s when I was growing up in the

65
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,080
city of Houston there's a master-planned

66
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,390
community very beautiful lots of

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,580
cottonwoods bike trails hike trails

68
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,299
parks but it was designed for young

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,760
families at a certain point those young

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,260
children became teenagers and they

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,700
started to quickly realize it beyond

72
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,130
going to school and going home there was

73
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,290
nothing for them there so a lot of those

74
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,640
kids turned to drugs and alcohol and at

75
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,380
a certain point someone who started

76
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,970
knocking over liquor stores with guns

77
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:07,920
and breaking into houses so and you know

78
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,780
rough lives were ruined those kids

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,309
simply weren't engaged and anything they

80
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,000
cared about and so they made their own

81
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,420
engagement I'm a big fan of not teaching

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,870
kids about certain types of technology

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,850
you look at the DEF CON kids and I'm not

84
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,650
picking on DEFCON kids my oldest

85
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,340
daughter learned to walk in DEFCON 7 she

86
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,459
was 9 months old I've been going I went

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,750
to DEFCON for a long time I don't think

88
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,030
it's appropriate to teach a

89
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,620
seven-year-old kid out of a box a dump

90
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,010
and the reason why is because several

91
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,920
kids do not have the ethical maturity to

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,959
understand the consequences of their

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,329
actions should they use that skill in

94
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,620
the wrong context right locks are

95
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,060
important the first time you learn to

96
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,430
pick a lock you realize it locks me

97
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,340
nothing I got my first set of pics I

98
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,230
went to went to a competition picks for

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,420
locks without any instruction whatsoever

100
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,670
got home picked every lock in my house

101
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,569
is like didn't matter anymore besides if

102
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,149
someone really wants to know

103
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,768
freaking window so I'm not a big fan of

104
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,420
teaching kids how to pick locks and then

105
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,489
letting them go I'm not a big fan of

106
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,048
having social engineering contests for

107
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,999
children where you teach these kids

108
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,769
these techniques why I think it's good

109
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:18,690
thought to teach them that they can be

110
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,389
socially engineered I think it's good to

111
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,800
teach them things at a high level so

112
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,300
they can be aware that maybe they're

113
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,220
being socially engineered I don't think

114
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,539
it's a good idea to say hey here's

115
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,330
social engineering and here's how you

116
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,860
can be better at it at 10 or 12 simply

117
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,250
because these kids don't have the

118
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,449
emotional maturity to be able to handle

119
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,729
so if we're going to raise these kids we

120
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,320
have to give them not only the skills

121
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,090
not only teach them how to do these

122
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,580
things but to give them they will try to

123
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,630
teach ethics we don't do a good job of

124
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,849
that knowledge is knowing tomatoes

125
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,210
approve not you know wisdoms company in

126
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:56,520
fruit salad you know it's hard to teach

127
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,049
that it's just something you kind of

128
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,430
kind of art and that's part of the

129
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,039
problems right a lot of that maturity

130
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,479
doesn't come until we get older I think

131
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,620
it's greg's teach get out of program I

132
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,180
think you should cease kids about

133
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,740
exploits when you teach them how to

134
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,060
program because that's something they

135
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,389
need to be aware of I think you're going

136
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,970
to teach a kid how to write exploits you

137
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:16,620
know I think that's a bad idea I just do

138
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,000
they don't have to they don't know how

139
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,110
to they don't have to use it responsibly

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,340
they don't have the wisdom so here's

141
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,810
what I've identified as some of the

142
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,270
biggest issues facing us and I think

143
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,889
this is actually my last slide third

144
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,330
electives classes taught anymore we

145
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,090
don't teach kids about ethics really

146
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,229
until they get to college that's bad no

147
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,549
hard and fast rules on what's

148
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,900
appropriate for your children because

149
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,919
you know them but unfortunately I mean

150
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,388
if you have enough kids are you doing

151
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,750
enough kids you realize an emotional and

152
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:45,720
ethical maturity different same kids say

153
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,669
they do similar things not the same what

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,870
works for me or my family may not work

155
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,880
for you but you should always learn from

156
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,469
whatever people doing you got to keep

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,740
your kids engaged and interesting and

158
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:56,289
important ways you need to make sure

159
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,210
important then and I'd like to thank all

160
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,130
these people for helping me out to be

161
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,909
still this talked down from an hour 26

162
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,909
at five to six
