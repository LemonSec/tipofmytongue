1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
the technique that I'm going to talk

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:09,570
about is something that I use all the

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:14,160
time in my own life so in October of

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,948
2009 I had a pretty good academic kind

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,550
of theoretical background digital

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,980
forensics but no real case experience

7
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:25,529
and so broadly calls me and says

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,980
wouldn't i'd like to go do an analysis

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,980
of a server for one of his company's

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,500
clients well it wasn't just any client

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,420
it turns out is probably I'd say the

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,100
most important client your company had

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,190
and it was a major case involving tens

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,100
of millions of dollars oh and owing to

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,110
unforeseen circumstances there was no

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,579
way for me to have any overlap with the

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,949
consultant who had started the

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,329
investigation just had an hour on a

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,550
conference call so I'm thinking maybe

20
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,870
some of you in the room i define a found

21
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,459
a polite way to know did that work

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,869
because he's kind of discouraging area

23
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:12,360
red high stakes a lot of unknowns maybe

24
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,430
you've got that kind of sinking churning

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,939
sensation in your stomach when I was

26
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,040
describing that scenario I've come to

27
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,729
recognize that sensation of my stutter

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,950
in my life and owing to a childhood

29
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,460
wasted playing Dungeons and Dragons I

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,409
think of it as facing a dragon but call

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,960
it what you want it's your brain right

32
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,939
it's your brain trying to protect you

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,929
from something that might be dangerous

34
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,639
to you but let me tell you that every

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,070
important thing that's happened in my

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,790
life has happened because I've done

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:52,559
something scary and on the other side of

38
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,820
that here it looks like you know nothing

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,119
so much as many fear of the unknown and

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,119
on the other side of that fear is

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,390
learning an opportunity for you so I'm

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,770
not saying that I lived without fear

43
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,970
what I'm saying is I've come to

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,680
recognize that feeling in my stomach and

45
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,989
when I feel that

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,519
the question is you know is that

47
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,909
something that's legitimately dangerous

48
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,040
to me or am I just psyching myself out

49
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:27,599
because it's something outside of my

50
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,129
comfort zone and it's the latter then

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,629
the question is you know should I face

52
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,679
down that gear should I accept that

53
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:37,950
challenge and see it through to the

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,109
other side now when you engage on

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,659
something like that though you know you

56
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:45,900
have to engage with the belief that

57
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,638
you're going to succeed because if you

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,769
go up against that dragon thinking that

59
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:54,560
you might fail then you probably will

60
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:56,790
now the dragon de prob offered me in

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,659
october two thousand nine was a pretty

62
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:04,530
big dragon but it's not like i was going

63
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:06,959
in completely unarmed I had you know a

64
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,879
dozen years of independent consulting

65
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,099
experience at that point I had

66
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,689
experience going into client sites with

67
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,450
figuring out what they needed you know

68
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:18,239
delivering I had you know decades of

69
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,159
experience studying and working with

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,810
computer systems understanding how they

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,340
work and all that stuff so I've been

72
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,939
facing dragons for a while and you

73
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,209
started a little baby dragons right you

74
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:35,519
know you start small and he's dragging

75
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,370
you defeat right it's just like a game

76
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,470
you get skills and experience right to

77
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,669
help you with the next dragon but more

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,819
importantly I think you gain confidence

79
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:50,189
right I beat the dragon I think the

80
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:53,069
out of that little bastard right and you

81
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,049
take that confidence with you to the

82
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:57,629
next experience and sometimes really

83
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,799
it's only that confidence that's going

84
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,578
to get you through to the other side

85
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,979
right when you're on fire right

86
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,729
sometimes it's only that confidence

87
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:12,060
that's going to carry you through so

88
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,739
look sometimes the fear is giving you

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,430
good data don't stick your finger in

90
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:19,000
that light stop it Eddie but as you make

91
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,750
a conscious decision

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,020
about facing our fears and accepting

93
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,940
those challenges we grow right a big bro

94
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,020
and skill and experience to grow

95
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:34,750
professionally and we grow as people and

96
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,460
it never stops there's always more

97
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,130
dragons on the other side of the one

98
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:42,810
that you just knocked over right

99
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,490
constant challenge is going on and so

100
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,620
for a lot of people get the real fear

101
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,260
that we're talking about it was fear of

102
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:54,040
failure because also sometimes the

103
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,469
dragon 2 kills you I mean it's a

104
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:00,190
legitimate fear sometimes we fail and

105
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,350
sometimes you fail spectacularly but

106
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,300
what's on the other side of that I mean

107
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,690
you know it's just a plinian not just

108
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,900
know I life goes on you have to you find

109
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:14,950
a way to move ahead from that and just

110
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,840
like that failure isn't final I'm also

111
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,390
here to tell you that success isn't

112
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,560
finally right you're in a comfort zone

113
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:27,010
right now and it's all good for you but

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,450
in our industry particularly but I mean

115
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,270
life is a general rule if you stand pat

116
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:37,860
you lose and so I would rather go out

117
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,150
and face those dragons on my own terms

118
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,180
then sort of sit in my comfortable

119
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,700
castle and watch the walls kind of

120
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:51,520
crumble down around me just due to

121
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:54,310
entropy so look I respect my dragons and

122
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,349
I will respect that beer but there's

123
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,870
also opportunities there and if I

124
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,400
succeeded at all of my career is because

125
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,400
of those challenges that I today's
