1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
what I was thinking about a topic post

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,250
hoc I located focus on the toxin trains

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,759
have gone before China finds his blue

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,700
duck down and if that many talks tend to

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,760
do with just one topic of time for DMI

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,279
are either post or network analysis it

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,779
can seem like the system presidents and

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,759
network forensics are two completely

9
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,250
separate fields separated by the wall

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,800
and evident usual meet but that's not

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,670
what our clients environment alike and

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,679
certainly not how they looked or

13
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,450
attackers attackers are using the

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,910
network to send commands the hosts and

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,920
uh move laterally between the hosts and

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,230
between the information up became corner

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,879
they leave evidence in both the host and

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,459
the network but the traces are quite

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,930
different granted we do have some

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,750
clients that are only willing to sign up

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,640
for a host site attention and other that

22
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,680
old setup your network attention but

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,590
either way we've been feeling like

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,239
missing import cars of the picture for

25
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,579
one of our never bowling clients we can

26
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,099
see the ongoing backdoor activity a lot

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,660
of the traffic is encrypted we can't see

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,670
what the attackers are doing with the

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,310
back door we can't acquire their tools

30
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,900
to determine if their new bearings we

31
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,700
can only see what detectors are doing

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,130
over the network and that we've

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,930
signatures for for example if the

34
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,759
tackles brought a pasty cracker to the

35
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,950
domain controller craft and a costume

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,150
the environment I started using legit

37
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,090
and credentials to gather information

38
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:27,000
and ftp audio organization we not might

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,439
not be able to see any vet at one of

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,329
oakland stalactites we've been

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,699
identifying instances past attacker

42
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,740
activity but finding active back doors

43
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,110
for current a track activity is much

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,179
more difficult too time-consuming the

45
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,070
terms level of detail analysis and

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,979
numerous systems which is time consuming

47
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,389
for us inexpensive the climate having

48
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,399
access to the network traffic would

49
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,340
quickly show us which systems are being

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,399
used which allows better scope intrusion

51
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,399
and tree analysis it would give us clues

52
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,399
the lateral movement and orders to

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,890
active data fat without that inside and

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,270
maybe start playing black normal i

55
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,840
identify

56
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:08,919
Christmas remediation while allowing the

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,569
types of fulbright addresses never

58
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,819
network and whose forensics can ensure

59
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,099
complement each other each has its

60
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,929
strengths and weaknesses but net web

61
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,899
site strikes tend to complement history

62
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,760
physics and vice versa network analysis

63
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,489
is great for alerting us to evil its

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,010
current and ongoing but often osco for

65
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:30,680
previous best if network traffic is

66
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,048
recorded as a visit it's gone which were

67
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,150
host nalysis can come in on the other

68
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:37,519
hand even with periodic endpoint sweeps

69
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,400
post analysis usually brings back data

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,519
after the fact but when we do find

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,079
assistant al Weis we can gather a

72
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,660
atonement previous activity sometimes

73
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:50,660
covered years of photographers this can

74
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,400
be critical for non droid breach network

75
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,739
and holistic tivity also in value in

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,910
context we children tell your client

77
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,099
that they have a tremendous deal

78
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,900
eroticism as much more impact when we

79
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,078
can identify specific dimensions which

80
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,340
have been uploaded remote server

81
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,380
similarly Mottola clients to these

82
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,000
systems are beaconing they cruised on

83
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,530
veteran when we identified which files

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,130
are met door and how they have gone

85
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,200
there no acknowledges grid for detective

86
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,450
product from no vectors which can show

87
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,819
tap directions as is happening as long

88
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,578
as factor traffic is eyes as their text

89
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,190
or can be decoded if it's not captured

90
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,690
or can't be decoded and when's the hosts

91
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,930
can detail be tagged his actions on

92
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,910
system attackers also often reuse their

93
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,459
infrastructure and tools traveling

94
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,989
traffic to no command control serves to

95
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,329
reveal neubauer and put two more

96
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,250
compromised close on the other hand

97
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,349
because easier to find new attack tools

98
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,799
on the pro side looking for suspicious

99
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,540
Bob Methodist analyzing those tools can

100
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,780
identify new network indicators can

101
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,548
detect the tools and other hosts using

102
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,500
both sides in our analysis is made

103
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,290
possible to detect and analyze breaches

104
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,049
faster since in just sokol minutes I'll

105
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,179
get just two examples in the first hour

106
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,120
network censors alerted us to points

107
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,130
listed beginning resuming HTTP responses

108
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,890
including known malicious 18

109
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,780
command control instructions in response

110
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:14,329
to download an additional hour and then

111
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,910
switch to encrypted ssl traffic end of

112
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,820
life the network site so we pull back

113
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,580
down at penises for analysis we analyze

114
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,260
the analyst of those prefetch files show

115
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,919
these sequence of commands photography

116
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,969
music together information about hosts

117
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,920
since we got a prompt alert to the

118
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,140
network traffic who were able to the

119
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,990
club is able to remove revista network

120
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,640
within hours the engine bridge in a

121
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,650
different example and honest needs to be

122
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,750
alerted me to a suspicious registry key

123
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,810
missed registry bronkaid are pointing to

124
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,910
an upscale javascript file bianca

125
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,620
skating and analyzing the file showed

126
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,240
there was a fully functional backdoor a

127
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,250
gradual stealer there's also people

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
downloading an executing additional

129
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:59,900
matter we wrote now exhibit was based on

130
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,330
analysis and again detecting its traffic

131
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,950
and other clients the host said finding

132
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,609
gave us the intelligence that we needed

133
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,590
to identify more breaches elsewhere in

134
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,210
this and in other examples without both

135
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,030
on her side and the network site

136
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,219
analysis it would be window full extent

137
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,929
attacker activity it will be much slower

138
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,930
to detect and respond to three just
