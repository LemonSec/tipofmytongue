1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,750
all right I'm right here and we're going

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,710
to talk about collecting evidence for

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,809
triage investigations I work for Grand

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,719
Rapids Community College and as you can

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,129
imagine we're pretty small and some

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,949
people are kind of amazed we even have a

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,690
security office

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,880
so we're two people and when I was

9
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,260
starting this project it was just me and

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,419
my boss doing the analysis so basically

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,910
I had this problem of every Friday

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,640
basically at 4:45 we did an

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,829
investigation and I was spent in the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
next you know weekend doing an

15
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,350
investigation so I spent a lot of time

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,760
imaging these drives and doing the

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,190
investigations and I wanted to go a

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,339
little quicker way to give you this

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,920
evidence so I had some goals I needed to

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,520
come up away with save some time come up

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,379
with an easy interface something to do

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,570
so if I'm not in the office I can just

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,570
give it to our desk and make it for me

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,658
many vectors of usage I wanted to do

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,390
command line and GUI option that's where

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,790
triage and response came in and here

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,650
you'll see the GUI interface that you

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,100
get you also have a command language you

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,420
can use the ini file which you all the

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,280
selection processes here our function

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,439
within the iodine isit even selected

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,930
there and you can turn the GUI off and

33
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,330
just click a button

34
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,620
as you would any other doing so what

35
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,020
you're going to get I took em idolize

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,210
approach every investigation was

37
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,429
different so I just wanted to collect

38
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,520
prefetch registry one case I can just

39
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,930
select at the run so you can these are

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,410
option to get system information network

41
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:56,350
registry hives including the bank's

42
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,350
disco and you collect evidence memory

43
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,619
score of the data I use Cory Harold's

44
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,290
practitioner method automated this

45
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:14,570
process so if we'll use the windows 8

46
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,730
guys to your BSP

47
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,470
and that it'll reflect in the evidence

48
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,820
that you want through their historical

49
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:29,150
data as well extras these are features

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:31,040
that I had hash me nem you guys want to

51
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,200
verify the integrity I'm that's

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,739
reflecting the Niger River reports and

53
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,820
will run automatically just getting go

54
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,890
compression compression was added

55
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,769
because a few people were running this

56
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,320
forward the network and they would just

57
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:46,910
send it a group work folder back and it

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,040
just makes it a lot smaller because if

59
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,590
you're collecting up now right stuff it

60
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,609
can get rather large so it just makes it

61
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,230
smaller so reports results you just have

62
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,239
a collected administered reports folder

63
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,880
it's gonna look something like this this

64
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,530
sea of evidence folder and that any of

65
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,250
the information is generally just put

66
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,019
into a text output into the report

67
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,810
folder your evidence Boulder because you

68
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:13,810
can see you collect a lot of evidence of

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,360
volatility

70
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,010
an external tool so none of these

71
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,730
collected first and then I go to

72
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,100
displace effect because reasonable is

73
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,470
just because when you're running these

74
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:36,829
tools can apply this so on and reflect

75
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:41,960
those before these tools used by using

76
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:50,240
system triples Windows command prompt

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:55,489
from react OS which is this glue kit Red

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,500
River and v5 here's just some ways that

79
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,190
I'm cocking the data so you can verify

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,330
using

81
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:07,010
robocopy each promo copy that's you use

82
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,840
this interface all switches do this is

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,649
not going to modify the timestamps for

84
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,730
copy data register built in Windows

85
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:20,899
command this is what's currently using

86
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:22,850
to copy the registry files it doesn't

87
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,299
work with the user class file which this

88
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,950
is what I find interesting solutions

89
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,800
using this kit if you have a live system

90
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:34,659
file that's blocked if you do in I find

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,080
we find the MFT entry and then variable

92
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:42,580
so once you have that variable in the

93
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,630
MFT you can carve it out with I cat

94
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,700
music you don't have

95
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,380
where's Locke you're not so if you want

96
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,120
to integrate that into your on scripts

97
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,600
it's a really great way to come around a

98
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,300
lot files information create tools

99
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,060
consistent journals and through built

100
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,700
built in Windows I cross-referenced HMO

101
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,370
law cause so you'll see information from

102
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,099
Allstate music at our fire integrity

103
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,950
everything's ran from a clean scores all

104
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,490
the applications are compiled into one

105
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,080
application and extract as you go

106
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,230
everything is hashed you can choose so

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,419
you can verify the integrity this is

108
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,460
just collecting evidence once you have

109
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,410
it you're going to need to analyze them

110
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,840
so you're gonna use volatility Red River

111
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:30,510
in a new standard open source tools that

112
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,979
you would use for your investigations if

113
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,900
you want to get it go it's open

114
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,000
available open source you can modify if

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,070
you want to or if you want you can

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
contact me and get out of the testing

117
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,000
list for the new versions
