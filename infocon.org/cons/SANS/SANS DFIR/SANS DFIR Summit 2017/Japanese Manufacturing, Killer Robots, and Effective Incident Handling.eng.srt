1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,902
(ambient music)

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,110
(applause)

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,078
- I'm not even trying that.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,446
Not even a little bit.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,849
- Come on man, put
some smoothness in it.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,550
(laughing)

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,252
- Alright, it's
just us between you

8
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:20,919
and afternoon break.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,491
So this is Japanese
Manufacturing

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,027
Killer Robots, and
Effective Incident Handling.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,928
I will warn you, it's
a little bit light

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,063
on the killer robots.

13
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,098
But we're working on it.

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,234
So quick introduction,
who we are

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,471
what we're about, and
what we're gonna tell you.

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,305
- [Kevin] Oh.

17
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,140
(laughing)

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,441
Can look at that huh?

19
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,308
- Yeah, there's that
one down there too.

20
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,610
- Alright, I'm Kevin.

21
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,379
Also known as the Kev
Dog, Beefist on Twitter.

22
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,082
Incident Response
Lead at Heroku.

23
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,951
Base guitar player, developer.

24
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:53,553
All around fun guy.

25
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,254
- [Scott] Best friend.

26
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,089
- Bestie.

27
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,923
- Yeah.

28
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:57,757
- [Kevin] Bestie.

29
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,724
- I'm Scott Roberts.

30
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,994
I am the SRT Lead at GitHub.

31
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:04,964
I'm also a forensics 578
instructor here with SANS

32
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,834
so come on out and do
some CTI at some point.

33
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,302
So what we're here to talk about

34
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:12,872
is how to be more efficient
with incident response.

35
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,407
We love the bits
and bites stuff.

36
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,444
We love doing you know, all
that kinda in the weeds stuff.

37
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,845
But in a lot of cases,
the biggest problems

38
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,280
that we run into personally

39
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,015
are more on the work flow

40
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:25,185
and how do you manage the
incident response process.

41
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,987
And so we're gonna use
some engineering techniques

42
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,722
to make that more effective.

43
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,223
I had to put science up there

44
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,794
because this Bill Nye
GIF is amazing right?

45
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,864
Man, not enough appreciation.

46
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,266
Alright, you guys
are tough crowd.

47
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,101
- [Kevin] And it's late.

48
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,301
- [Scott] It is late.

49
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,503
- [Kevin] It's
late, they're tired.

50
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,771
- Okay, so what we're
gonna talk about

51
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,206
is a low cost
collaborative method

52
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:49,375
for managing common incident
response work flows.

53
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,244
There's gonna be
some flexibility.

54
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,679
Gonna be a pretty wide variety

55
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,080
of how we're gonna approach it.

56
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,414
But this should be something

57
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,750
that if it speaks to you

58
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,052
you should be able to take back

59
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,155
use on next week on
your next incident.

60
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,758
- Alright, so you've
got 99 problems

61
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,527
when you're dealing
with incidents.

62
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,496
Whether you're
trying to figure out

63
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,898
how are you gonna allow
multiple responders

64
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,867
to coordinate their activity.

65
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,935
How are you gonna
establish comps.

66
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,538
You have no money
because you're broke.

67
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,906
But the one that was really

68
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,741
kinda sticking in
my head one day

69
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,411
was how do we move the
capability maturity model.

70
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,381
So think back to when you
were doing your CISSP prep.

71
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,215
You have your--

72
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,717
- [Scott] Boo!

73
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,318
- [Kevin] Oh okay, or when
you went to business school

74
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,153
or whatever right?

75
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:33,987
- [Scott] Boo!

76
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,321
- [Kevin] Ugh.

77
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,056
- [Scott] Do you want
me to do a third one?

78
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:38,491
- You've got,
okay, so you've got

79
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,661
your capability maturity
model down here at the bottom.

80
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,896
You've got you know

81
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,364
things are very ad
hoc and unpredictable.

82
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,634
An incident comes up and
everybody on the team

83
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,268
just does whatever
they think is right

84
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,104
to try to make it better.

85
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,540
And when it's over, you
kinda hope it's better okay.

86
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,073
But it's chaotic.

87
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,876
What you want to do, is
we want to move from that

88
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,244
up to manage.

89
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,346
And at the manage
perspective, you can still be

90
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,848
a little bit chaotic.

91
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,516
You can still be making
things up as you go along

92
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,653
but now you have distinct
assignment and tracking.

93
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,488
I'm saying you in
particular are responsible

94
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,856
for accomplishing this task.

95
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,357
And I'm gonna see to it

96
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,726
that I'm gonna track your
completion of that task

97
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,228
and I'm gonna know it's done.

98
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,830
And then from there, we
try and move in to define

99
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,332
where we actually
start to put together

100
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,001
what is going to be our plan
for this type of incident

101
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,670
over and over again.

102
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,772
So, today we're gonna be talking

103
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,707
about these first three levels.

104
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,676
Moving from initial
to manage, to define.

105
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,611
If you want to get
quantitatively managed

106
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,346
hit me up later
for a Varis talk.

107
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,114
I'll get into that.

108
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,418
But this all reeks of
project management.

109
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,819
You know, and so I
was sitting there

110
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,921
and I was starting to
think of my incidents

111
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,958
as if they were just
really condensed projects.

112
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,527
And so then I
started looking for

113
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,828
project management methodologies

114
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,098
and I came across you
know, what we were doing

115
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,032
with our projects.

116
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,000
And I said could I take that

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,535
and apply it to our incidents?

118
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,337
And I tried it out a few
times and it really worked

119
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:59,037
and so, Scott over here

120
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,840
you know, bestie of
mine and everything.

121
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,975
So I'm talking to him one day

122
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,609
I'm like man, Scott.

123
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,078
I'm brilliant you know.

124
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,281
I found a way to take our
project management methodology

125
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,049
and apply it to
incident response.

126
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,651
No one's ever done this before.

127
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,753
And Scott's like, funny
you should mention it.

128
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,688
We started doing the
exact same thing.

129
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,923
And so I thought well, if
it's good enough for Scott

130
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:19,625
it's good enough for me.

131
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,162
And so you know, we started
to refine it a bit more.

132
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,563
And came to this.

133
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,967
- So I wasn't nearly
that brilliant.

134
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,936
I had actually just
gotten done reading a book

135
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,304
called The Lean Startup.

136
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,505
And if you haven't read it

137
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,107
even if you're not
in a startup position

138
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,242
it's a really fantastic resource

139
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:39,312
for just looking at
how ideas go from

140
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,582
just an idea to something
that gets out the door.

141
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,683
And reading through
The Lean Startup

142
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,955
they end up taking a lot from
Toyota manufacturing theory

143
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,890
circa, like just
after World War II.

144
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,093
And one of the ideas
they get into a lot

145
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,995
is this idea of just in time.

146
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,631
Just in time is a
factory management theory

147
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,034
of being able to
create resources

148
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,869
exactly at the
time you need them

149
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,773
in order to manufacture
some end state.

150
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,675
Well, you know, being
time constrained

151
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:09,942
being resource constrained

152
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,744
and having to just
get something done

153
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,414
to me, reeked a lot
of incident response.

154
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,550
And so it turns out, in
doing incident response

155
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,520
or in doing the just
in time development

156
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,820
one of the things
they end up using

157
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,389
is this idea of Kanban.

158
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,293
And if you haven't seen it,
Kanban is a management platform

159
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,129
for originally aimed
at manufacturing

160
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:32,298
that's been translated
to a lot of other cases

161
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,801
like software development,
project management.

162
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,537
And now after this talk,
you're all witnessing

163
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,304
hopefully, incident response.

164
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,873
- [Kevin] Incident
response, yeah.

165
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,377
- And so at its core,
Kanban's really simple.

166
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:48,448
You have columns of either
statuses or actions.

167
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,450
And then you have
what are called cards.

168
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,721
And cards are again, either
actions or sometimes entities

169
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,256
that you move through a process.

170
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,991
And the idea is it's
supposed to be really quick

171
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,226
to look at a process like this

172
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,528
and go okay, based on
what I can see up there

173
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,798
it seems like to do, most
of the things are in to do

174
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,834
and I can look
directly at what's done

175
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,001
and I know what's being done

176
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,503
as it's working immediately.

177
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,140
What this looks like in a
software development perspective

178
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,143
is you see, you have the idea
of planning with stories.

179
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,678
Features to do.

180
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,013
In progress, testing.

181
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,417
And the idea is it's not about
a specific set of columns

182
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,820
or specific set of
cards, it's flexible.

183
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,991
Here's a well known Silicon
Valley startup using Kanban.

184
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,461
And ultimately,
it's great for both

185
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,963
really short term tasks

186
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,664
like the manufacturing of cars

187
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,032
that it was original aimed at.

188
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,734
As well as longer term tasks

189
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,570
like managing months and
months long projects.

190
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,708
And what we found that
was interesting about it

191
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,644
is both Kevin and I were using
the same set of techniques

192
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,713
but we're using it in
completely different ways.

193
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,616
And we kinda came and assumed,
as soon as we said Kanban

194
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,818
I think that we're gonna
be doing the same thing.

195
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,085
And what we ended up finding out

196
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,054
is we were taking very
different approaches.

197
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,623
And I liken this a lot to jazz.

198
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,960
And jazz is incredibly free form

199
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,131
as soon as you understand
there's a structure to it.

200
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,468
I was gonna see
how long you went.

201
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,302
- No.

202
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,136
- Are you good?

203
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:17,970
- Keep going.

204
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,805
- Okay.

205
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,239
- You're fine.

206
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,707
- So the point of this is,
take a look at this methodology

207
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,310
see how you can adapt it
to the work flows you have.

208
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,446
It's not about copying
the boards that we put up

209
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,680
or the ways that we
talk about doing it.

210
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,115
It's a structure.

211
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,119
- [Kevin] So what we've
kinda been showing you so far

212
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,388
is how this relates
to auto manufacturing.

213
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,289
How does this relate
to incident response?

214
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,725
And as Scott was mentioning

215
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,694
you know, you can
put entities in there

216
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,795
or you can put tasks.

217
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,397
I tend to go with tasks.

218
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,799
So for instance, one of the
columns that I might have

219
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,568
in an incident is you
know, here are tasks

220
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,371
that need to be done for
every incident no matter what.

221
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,940
You know, I'm always
gonna be setting up comps.

222
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,509
I'm always gonna be
establishing a timeline, etc.

223
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,511
And so that's kinda the stuff

224
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,080
that you put into
your Kanban boards

225
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,149
if you were not
manufacturing cars.

226
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,351
Would be stuff like this.

227
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,653
- So as soon as we start talking
about something like this

228
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,323
tools are a part of it.

229
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,157
It's more about the methodology.

230
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,626
We're just gonna tell
you about the tools

231
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,796
that we happen to use in
our day to day use of this.

232
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,332
It turns out, part
of the other reason

233
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,666
I got to start using this

234
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,668
is GitHub, as a product

235
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,270
added the idea of doing projects

236
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,871
which are Kanban boards.

237
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,340
We were already tracking

238
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,842
a lot of our information
in repositories

239
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,410
so it was a place that
we kept interesting logs.

240
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,679
It was a place that we kept
descriptions of incidents.

241
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,516
It was a place that we'd keep
malware and things like that.

242
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,620
And being able to take,
add a Kanban board to it

243
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,255
to start tracking
some of the processes

244
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,489
that were going along with it

245
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,258
was super natural
and easy for us

246
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,627
simply because we
already had users there.

247
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,161
We already could
manage permissions.

248
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,796
We already had it set up for us.

249
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,166
As far as GitHub projects goes

250
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,837
there's this cool
ability to assign cards

251
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,170
to individual people

252
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,073
so when tasks need to
go to specific analysts

253
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,574
we can do that.

254
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,678
Actually, every card is
backed by a GitHub issue.

255
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,547
So we could keep
track of conversations

256
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,115
and changes there.

257
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,617
There's a super easy API to use.

258
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,786
But it's a new feature for us.

259
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,087
And so there's some things

260
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,090
that a little bit more
matured tool might have

261
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,393
that we don't necessarily
have, like templating.

262
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,594
- [Kevin] Yeah, all of it.

263
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,795
- [Scott] So here's
a quick example

264
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,530
of what one of these
boards could look like.

265
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,199
You'll see columns,
individual cards.

266
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,702
There's assignments
to individual people.

267
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,704
We can do some tagging
and things like that.

268
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,539
So from a work flow
management perspective

269
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:38,110
there's a lot of the things
that we need already there.

270
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,047
- Another one, the one
that we use at Heroku

271
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,249
is typically gonna be Trello.

272
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,453
And in this case, Kanban
is their main product.

273
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:48,721
So it's gonna be a
little more slick

274
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,390
than GitHub projects,
for now, for now.

275
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,290
- For now.

276
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,593
- For now, for now.

277
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,493
It's very full featured GUY.

278
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,129
But again, you can
do all the things

279
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,599
like keeping all the discussion
about a particular task

280
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,800
on that card.

281
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,001
I really value that.

282
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,435
Especially when
it's something like

283
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,671
if we're looking at, for example

284
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,573
leaked credential or
something like that.

285
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,608
And I want to see, and you know

286
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,577
one of the tasks might be,
find out if this has been used

287
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,212
since the time it was
leaked or whatever.

288
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,081
And then we can have all
of the discussion related

289
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,183
to that task, in that card.

290
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,818
Because to me, it's
really valuable

291
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,853
to be able to
reconstruct the response

292
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,756
not just the incident, but also
reconstructing the response.

293
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,156
So I like being able to do that.

294
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,226
It has great chat integration.

295
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,929
So I can integrate with Slack.

296
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,164
One of the things
that we do at Heroku

297
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,899
is we'll create a
distinct chatroom

298
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,534
for every incident
that's going on

299
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,337
so we don't find
ourselves trying to talk

300
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,506
about several things
in the same room.

301
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,442
And I can integrate that
with Trello in such a way

302
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,978
that as we're talking,
if we're like oh yeah

303
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,213
we're gonna need to do that

304
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:50,348
I can, from the chatroom
issue a chat command

305
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,485
that will create
boards, create cards

306
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,620
on the Kanban board for me.

307
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,256
And as people update their
cards, I'll see those updates

308
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,723
come into the chatroom.

309
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,359
So it really helps with
keeping everybody coordinated

310
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,727
on what's been done.

311
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:05,898
Even if they're not necessarily
staring at the board.

312
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:06,899
And this is an example

313
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,801
of what it looks like in Trello.

314
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,538
As you can see, unlike GitHub
this has a blue background

315
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,709
so you can tell that it's
a prettier GUY here, GUY.

316
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,745
Because we made it blue.

317
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,013
- [Scott] Because
it's super blue.

318
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,947
- [Kevin] Because
they made it blue.

319
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,416
I didn't make it blue, alright.

320
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,353
So think back to when you were
learning incident response

321
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,587
from your SANS classes.

322
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,289
- [Scott] 504!

323
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,526
- Yeah, we had these phases
of incident response.

324
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,194
And what we're talking
about here in particular

325
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,728
is the preparation phase.

326
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,532
Preparation phase, helping
all of your other phases.

327
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,233
But one of the
things that I like

328
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,535
to actually do with my boards

329
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,170
is create columns for
those different phases

330
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,472
of an incident.

331
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,240
So I'll build
template boards out

332
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,775
for common types of incidents.

333
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,078
And I'll start with
my column of you know

334
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,846
the basic things that
I do in every incident.

335
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,115
And then I'll add in, okay
what are my containment tasks.

336
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,784
What are my eradication tasks.

337
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,920
If there's things like, for
this particular kind of thing

338
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,689
do I need do invalidate
a UB key for instance.

339
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,092
Like, if it's a stolen laptop
or something like that.

340
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,893
I make sure that
that's always in there.

341
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,662
And that's really
what is moving us

342
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,932
from having a managed response

343
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,934
where yes, I'm keeping
track of everything

344
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,203
to having a defined
response now.

345
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,271
Where when I'm
talking to an auditor

346
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,608
and they say hey, do you guys
follow a common procedure

347
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,008
for every type of this incident

348
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,244
I can say, yes I can.

349
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,879
Here's our playbook,
the playbook is

350
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,347
to copy this template incident.

351
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,683
Which, that's another
thing you can do in Trello

352
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,117
that you can't
right now on GitHub

353
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,452
is just a template.

354
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,020
But I can copy this template

355
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,655
and then everyone who
comes into my board

356
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,390
immediately knows there
are these certain tasks

357
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,692
that are always gonna be present

358
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,160
in every on of these incidents.

359
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,329
Another column that
I really like to have

360
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,662
is a lesson learned column.

361
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,031
It's kind of a dumping ground

362
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,867
for as we go through
the incident saying

363
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,536
oh man, we should talk
about that at the retro.

364
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,704
I can just quick throw
a card into that column.

365
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,874
But the meat and potatoes.

366
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,877
The easy, good place to start.

367
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,314
Yes, is these are my
three go to columns.

368
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,849
The in progress
column, the done column

369
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,352
and the canceled column.

370
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,220
Now earlier Scott said you
don't have to do everything

371
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,090
the way that we do, but this
one I'm a real stickler for.

372
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,091
You have to do it my way.

373
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,626
(laughing)

374
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,629
And that is, if there's a
card in the in progress column

375
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,165
there has to be a
person assigned to it.

376
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,199
And if there's a card
in the canceled column

377
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,701
there has to be an explanation

378
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,971
for why we decided this card
does not need to be done.

379
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,573
And hey, that happens
a lot you know?

380
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,875
I might say, you know,
we need to put up a card

381
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,411
to investigate if
this particular cred

382
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,113
has been used anywhere.

383
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,316
And then it's sitting
in the to do list.

384
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,551
Like, we haven't gotten to it.

385
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,852
And then somebody else
goes you know what?

386
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,853
None of those creds
actually got leaked.

387
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,890
Now I can cancel that, okay
that's a canceled task.

388
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,792
But I need to explain that.

389
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,227
Because again, one
of my big things

390
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,829
is being able to reconstruct
our response as well.

391
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,331
So being able to say
oh, we canceled that

392
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,033
because you know,
George figured out

393
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,503
that those credentials didn't
get exposed or something.

394
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,071
- Yeah, I think that gets to
one of the important things

395
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,173
about using this
particular methodology

396
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,242
is it's incredibly flexible

397
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,877
but that requires a certain
amount of discipline

398
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,313
on the part of the
team that's using it.

399
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,714
It's easy to just move
stuff towards the end

400
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,182
without any explanation
if you don't

401
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,550
take the time to do that.

402
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,785
- Right, so here's an example

403
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,988
of you know, just
one of our incidents

404
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,823
where I've got the things
that are in progress.

405
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,558
The things that are done,
the things that are canceled.

406
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,760
And you'll notice that I've
got a pretty little face

407
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,095
on each one of those.

408
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,397
The other thing that I
love about using these

409
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,199
for incident response

410
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,767
is when it comes
time to do handover

411
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,570
this is, you can
get, look at a board

412
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,473
and in 15 seconds, you
know the lay of the land.

413
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,406
You've got it.

414
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,642
And I've not found anything

415
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,644
that does a faster
turnover than that.

416
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,246
So if I'm the incident commodore

417
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,081
and it's getting to
be the end of my day.

418
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,350
I can you know, say
to our west coast guys

419
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,252
hey, let's do turnover.

420
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,319
They'll look at the
board real quick.

421
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,122
Then we hop on a
call and say alright

422
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,824
do you have any questions
about what's going on?

423
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,825
And almost always it's
gonna be no, I don't.

424
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,928
Or you know maybe
one or two questions.

425
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,632
But typically, if the
board has been run properly

426
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,000
to my standards

427
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,935
there will be
almost no questions.

428
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,271
And then it will be like okay,
I'm ready to be relieved.

429
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,572
I'm ready to relieve you.

430
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,741
We hand off and now
that other person

431
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,141
is the incident commodore.

432
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,912
- The ability for this
particular technique

433
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,447
to limit the amount of
status updates I've had to do

434
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,349
is amazing because exactly.

435
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,051
You take one look at the board

436
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,552
and somebody can figure out

437
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,388
what are the tasks that have
already been accomplished.

438
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,889
What are the tasks that
are waiting to be done.

439
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,059
And who should I talk to
about any individual task.

440
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,661
- Quick, quick question.

441
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,462
How many people have a
manager that hits you up

442
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,131
for an update every 10 minutes

443
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,065
when you're trying
to do something?

444
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,901
Okay, yes, okay.

445
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,069
- We can't actually
see any of you.

446
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,603
It is really bright up here.

447
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,539
- I actually, I think I saw
one person raise their hand.

448
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,341
But anyways, you point
them to the board

449
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,109
and from that point
on, they don't.

450
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,411
Once they learn to trust you

451
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,045
that you're keeping
the board up to date

452
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,314
they will stop with that.

453
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,415
But again, you've
got to be doing it

454
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,884
to my exact standards

455
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,919
where those cards
have to be accurate.

456
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,021
But once you've
trained your managers

457
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,488
that the board is accurate

458
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,292
they will stop bothering you
every 10 minutes for an update.

459
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,494
- It's absolutely the case.

460
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,797
- So here's an example.

461
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,232
You're just trying to
like, fill things out

462
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,569
a little bit more of
a lost/stolen laptop.

463
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,603
So here I might have
this as a template

464
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,139
which I can do with Trello.

465
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,176
So I've again, got my
tasks that need to be done

466
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,110
for every incident.

467
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,478
Then I've got containment tasks.

468
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,113
I've got my lesson
learned column.

469
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,015
The in progress,
the done column.

470
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,352
And if we get a stolen
laptop reported to us

471
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,220
our playbook says
step number one

472
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,956
is go to the lost/stolen
laptop template board.

473
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,358
Say copy board.

474
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,359
And now run the board.

475
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,729
And that's really, really
easy to understand.

476
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,197
Really easy to explain.

477
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,432
And when you're talking to
an auditor about your process

478
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,001
and they want to say,
well do you follow this

479
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,468
for every lost laptop?

480
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,937
I can say yes I do.

481
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,171
I've got this great board.

482
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,440
I can show you all of
our boards, it's great.

483
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,609
- And I can tell right now,
you have to get to work

484
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,544
because you apparently haven't
done much for this one yet.

485
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,779
(laughing)

486
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,647
- This is the template
man, it's the template.

487
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,983
- So let's talk about a couple
other example work loads

488
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,652
of things you could do with
this same type of format.

489
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,722
So a couple weeks ago

490
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,824
the Handbrake compromise

491
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:09,728
that lead to the OSX Proton
RAT being sent around.

492
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,430
We had a big part of our fleet

493
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,265
that we were able to
just automatically triage

494
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,867
and go nope, no infections.

495
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,269
We had a small part of our
fleet we couldn't do that with.

496
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,737
And so we ended up having to go

497
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,306
into a system triage work flow
using something like this.

498
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,242
We had to request from
users that they run a tool.

499
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,577
They give us a live response.

500
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,012
We analyze the live response

501
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,514
to decide whether a system
needed to be remediated or not.

502
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,550
And then put it back
into production.

503
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,851
This was a super fast way

504
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,287
to keep everybody on
the same page for that

505
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:39,458
which was pretty chaotic,
managing 600 laptops in the end.

506
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,429
Malicious, or
compromised resources.

507
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,664
Being able to track you
know, stolen credentials.

508
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,699
And go, have they
been looked at?

509
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,101
Has the password been reset?

510
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,804
Be able to get a quick
look at where you are

511
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,172
in that process

512
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,606
and make sure that
you're following it

513
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,442
through the whole way.

514
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,079
Indicator development,
my intel people.

515
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,548
I like using this for
intelligence as well.

516
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,483
Because taking a new IP

517
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,351
running it, putting it
into a backlog of IPs

518
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,987
to be looked at eventually

519
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,923
enriching it, and
then moving it through

520
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,125
the different courses of action.

521
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,361
This provides a really
consistent process

522
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,863
as you're going through that.

523
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,567
As well as even eventually
moving it out of production.

524
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,001
You're able to take one look

525
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,804
and see all the different
pieces of indicators

526
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,841
you have available
throughout your environment.

527
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,909
On the other side, from the
non-technical part of intel

528
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,947
you can use this for
intelligence product management.

529
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,548
Say you're putting
out weekly products.

530
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,584
You're putting out
quarterly products.

531
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,819
Being able to move them
through this process

532
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,754
with teams that are not
even necessarily related

533
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,290
to incident response

534
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,860
whether it's your writing
team, your editing team

535
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,429
the stakeholders, it makes
it really easy to keep track

536
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,601
of where in the process all
your documents could be at.

537
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,437
And ultimately,
any time you come

538
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,039
to these sorts of processes

539
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,408
where they become very rote

540
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,877
for an organization.

541
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,178
They become ripe for automation.

542
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,181
And one of the things
I'll say to look for

543
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,116
in any Kanban
solution if you decide

544
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,783
to take a trial with this

545
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,287
is look for the
ability to automate.

546
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,157
Trello and GitHub both
do, there's a wide variety

547
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,627
of internal you know,
open source Kanban boards.

548
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,829
Automation though,
should always be the key.

549
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,865
Because after a couple
times running through

550
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,333
any of these processes

551
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,670
the places to automate start
to become really, really clear.

552
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,272
And so being able to do that

553
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:34,606
leads to, like we were saying

554
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,008
working with auditors

555
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,409
and being able to point to

556
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,111
do we do everything the
same way every time?

557
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,080
Absolutely, because we're
not even managing it.

558
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,350
The board is managing it for us.

559
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,284
The other thing about that

560
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:47,553
is it reduces admin overhead.

561
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,087
Who wants to be in the
middle of an incident

562
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,923
worrying about whether
all your documentation

563
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,258
is in exactly the
right order yet?

564
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,094
I know I've been on plenty
of incident responses

565
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,297
where we said hey, we're
totally gonna figure that out

566
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,831
after the fact.

567
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,500
Then I have to go look at a
paragraph of my own writing

568
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,635
going, what was I
saying at 2:00 a.m.

569
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,238
hopped up on Red Bull
when I wrote that?

570
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,440
Being able to automate
some of this stuff

571
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,142
and move it that way

572
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,044
is incredibly powerful.

573
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,680
So, if you want to try it

574
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,783
I put together a little
bit of a work flow

575
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,052
for doing this on
the GitHub page.

576
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,521
So you can go to
incident template.

577
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,322
It's a work in progress.

578
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,857
It's not done.

579
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,160
I would love it if people
want to jump in and help.

580
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,262
And I'm gonna keep trying
to move it forward as well

581
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,399
based on some of the stuff
that we're doing at GitHub.

582
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,200
And I'm gonna give you
one more bonus piece.

583
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,003
And one of the other
things I liked a lot

584
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:41,106
when I started reading
about this Toyota way

585
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,442
is one of the techniques
they always used

586
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,510
is what they called
The Five Why's.

587
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,247
And it's a root cause
analysis technique

588
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,515
of constantly asking why

589
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,918
to get to the original issue.

590
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,554
It's super simple
and super powerful.

591
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,957
I feel like a lot of
organizations really struggle

592
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,259
with doing retrospectives

593
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,593
and trying to get
to the root cause.

594
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,495
I think this is a really
powerful technique

595
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,032
that's totally
worth looking into.

596
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,367
- Alright, so...

597
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,535
I don't know.

598
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,570
This is our conclusion slide.

599
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,571
What did we conclude?

600
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,972
- What do we conclude?

601
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,941
Well I think it's a repeatable
and flexible process.

602
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,109
- Yes.

603
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,477
- I think that it helps
make communication

604
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,447
consistent both between
team members and leadership.

605
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,748
- Yes, yes.

606
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,617
- And I think that it's
incredible powerful

607
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,319
and just a little
bit of scripting

608
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,388
with you know, some Python
or something like that.

609
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,255
Or even built into
the tool itself

610
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:32,924
can make it extra powerful.

611
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,927
- Yes, and you don't have
to do it Scott's way.

612
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,862
But you do have to do it my way.

613
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,331
- Also yes.

614
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,165
- Yes.

615
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,768
(upbeat music)
