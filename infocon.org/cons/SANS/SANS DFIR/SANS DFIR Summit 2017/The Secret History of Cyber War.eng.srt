00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,479
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:14,190
the thing that a lot of people are

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,850
surprised by in reading this book is

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,100
that none of the problems you're working

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,180
on now are anew and in fact they're

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,010
older than 20 years ago it goes back to

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,519
the very beginning of the internet in

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:34,950
1967 50 years ago as the ARPANET was

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,469
being rolled out there was a guy named

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,090
Willis where he was the head of the

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,030
computer science department at the RAND

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,129
Corporation he'd worked with von Neumann

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,860
on some of the first computers he was on

15
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,829
the scientific advisory board of the NSA

16
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,500
and he wrote a paper it was secret at

17
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,320
the time but it's declassified since you

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,590
can read it it's quite illuminating and

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,350
he says look yes the problem with

20
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,449
putting information on a network making

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,739
information available online I think

22
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,619
this might have been the first use of

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:13,080
the word online in this context online

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,119
to remote users in unsecured locations

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,280
is that you're creating inherent

26
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,710
vulnerabilities you're not going to be

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,720
able to keep secrets anymore so when I

28
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,780
was researching this book I went I

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,030
talked with this guy named Steve Lukasik

30
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,340
who is the deputy director of RP at the

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,890
time and supervising the ARPANET program

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,170
and I said were you familiar with Willis

33
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,240
where's paper it's all yes sure I knew

34
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,619
Willis and I said well what you think

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,270
and he said well I took the paper to my

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,070
team and I talked with a couple people

37
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,460
on this team to who confirmed it and

38
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,919
they said oh Jesus don't don't

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,020
saddle us with a security requirement

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,780
look look how hard it was just to do

41
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,158
what we've done it's like it's like

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,320
telling the Wright brothers that the

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,500
first plane has to carry 20 passengers

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,110
for 100 miles let's take this one step

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,000
at a time it's going to be decades

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,189
before the Russians can do anything like

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,120
this anyway and now I did take decades

48
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:11,079
took two and a half three decades

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,020
but by that time whole systems and

50
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,810
networks had grown up with no provision

51
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,730
for security and so I look at this as

52
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,150
kind of the bitten Apple in the digital

53
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:27,250
Garden of Eden it was embedded in the

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:29,440
technology itself from its birth and so

55
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,930
this is more than just an interesting

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,620
historical fact I mean what it really

57
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,960
means

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,470
especially for a community like this is

59
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,690
that this is not a problem to be solved

60
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,160
it's a problem to be controlled

61
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:46,890
contained mitigated monitored but it's

62
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,620
not going to be solved in other words

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:53,859
you're always going to have jobs you

64
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,290
know we could you know after they find a

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,440
cure for cancer this is still going to

66
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,489
be a problem after they set up colonies

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:07,150
on Mars or invent a faster-than-light

68
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:10,930
locket this is probably still going to

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:15,970
be a problem so one application of this

70
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:18,489
is that you know there are no solutions

71
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,590
there is no for many years I was told

72
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,390
the NSA you know these brilliant

73
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,030
mathematicians at the NSA they were

74
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,359
convinced that at some point they were

75
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,270
going to find the magic algorithm they

76
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,590
were going to invent the magic box that

77
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,790
would just keep everybody out have

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,400
communications flowing where they wanted

79
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,950
it to flow and have everybody else out

80
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,050
and then of course somebody came up with

81
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:50,200
a thumb drive and that was the end of

82
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:51,610
that fantasy that was it and so they've

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,410
come up with different concepts but

84
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,750
let's go back so what is where it comes

85
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,609
up with this paper in 1967

86
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,910
of course pac-man almost nobody had

87
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:03,790
computers so nobody this was beyond

88
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:08,500
esoteric nobody had paid attention to

89
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:11,380
this until 1983 and the key moment was

90
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,579
when Ronald Reagan went up to Camp David

91
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,790
and watch the movie wargames I'm sure

92
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,460
you've all seen were there

93
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,820
I know a lot of people who got into this

94
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,620
field because of war days so you know if

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,590
you recall Matthew Broderick plays this

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,990
tech whiz teenager who he thinks that

97
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,659
he's glommed on to a new online game

98
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,580
called global thermonuclear war but in

99
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,250
fact he's unwittingly hacked into the

100
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,960
NORAD main computer and just about

101
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,330
triggers World War 3

102
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,580
so Reagan watches this movie he comes

103
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,500
back to the White House the following

104
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,250
Wednesday this was the first weekend of

105
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,770
June and it's a big national security

106
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,120
meeting about something else completely

107
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,070
different there's nothing to do with

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,680
this but at some point he puts down his

109
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,380
index cards and he says has anybody seen

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,480
this movie war game it had just come out

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,850
previous Friday nobody seen it so he

112
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,160
launches into this very detailed plot

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,840
description and people are kind of

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,880
looking around the room like where's

115
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,679
this you know about three months earlier

116
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,900
he'd given the Star Wars speech which

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,580
everybody thought was netting so people

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,679
are wondering what worried the old man

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,909
going with this one finally he turns to

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,550
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of

121
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,470
Staff General John Bevin he says general

122
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,480
could could something like this happen

123
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,660
could it really happen could could

124
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,060
somebody just break into our most secret

125
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,070
computers and the general says I'll look

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,200
into that mr. president and he comes

127
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,659
back a week later he says mr. president

128
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:44,719
the problem is much worse than you think

129
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,790
as a result of which one year later 1984

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,350
the first national security decision

131
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:55,110
directive NS DD 145 been Declassified

132
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,450
since you can look it up came out and it

133
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,420
was the first presidential directive on

134
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,969
computer security and when you look up

135
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,490
this document and you read it you will

136
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,090
notice one striking thing that it reads

137
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,890
exactly the same as many such documents

138
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,650
that you're reading today that were

139
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,960
written just last week in our computers

140
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,510
which were buying and greater number are

141
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,419
vulnerable to electronic and other forms

142
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:25,469
of intercept by terrorists criminals and

143
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:27,930
foreign agencies the Calissa luciene

144
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:31,050
because directive was really written by

145
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,840
the NSA who had the only people who knew

146
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,930
about these things

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,580
was basically to turnover standards for

148
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,650
all computers in the United States

149
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,500
commercial business private melchi are

150
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,138
giving to the NSA or to a committee

151
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,010
whose head would also be the director of

152
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:47,110
the NSA

153
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,430
okay well this didn't go over on Capitol

154
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,620
Hill where they still have the quaint

155
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,270
notion that the NSA should just should

156
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,840
not be involved in domestic surveillance

157
00:06:52,270 --> 00:07:01,330
of any sort so this is when the fateful

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:05,859
divide was struck where basically dot

159
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:09,010
mil would be secured by the NSA and all

160
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,139
other things would be secured by a unit

161
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,400
of the Department of Commerce and of

162
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,950
course the problem was that the

163
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,229
Department of Commerce had no ability to

164
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,639
do this they didn't have the technology

165
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,060
they didn't have the manpower they

166
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,310
didn't had the money and NSA had no

167
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,240
interest in doing this at that time the

168
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,910
NSA's attitude was if we discover a

169
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,740
security gap will exploit it we're not

170
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,820
interested in patching it we're going to

171
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,190
because everybody else has the same

172
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,330
systems we're going to exploit it

173
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:43,590
so another decade passed with no action

174
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:48,070
on the problem that Willis we're

175
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:51,489
discovered in 1967 where things changed

176
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:54,700
was there was a three-star general Air

177
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:56,440
Force general named Ken Minahan and he

178
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,419
was the director of something called the

179
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,570
air force information warfare center in

180
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:03,219
San Antonio and these were the guys who

181
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,750
were doing the first name sorry they

182
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,030
mainly were guys back then who were

183
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,340
first getting into computer

184
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:14,919
vulnerability both the offense and the

185
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,179
defense part of it and then an was very

186
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,789
keen to this and he was frustrated

187
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,210
because none of his other fellow

188
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,469
generals in the Pentagon paid any

189
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,419
attention he would give them these

190
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,090
briefings about the vulnerability of

191
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,310
computers David you know again this is

192
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,500
you know nobody knew anything about

193
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:35,260
computers this was the mid-90s

194
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,690
now the army was run by tank generals

195
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,939
the Air Force was run by fighter pilots

196
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,640
and bomber pilots the Navy by submarine

197
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,070
and aircraft carrier captain computers

198
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,650
were a sideshow so minute hand

199
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:55,090
and decided to create a war game himself

200
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:58,750
was it exercise it was called eligible

201
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:02,410
receiver 97 it was in 1997 and what he

202
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,690
and a 25 man Red Team and the young FA

203
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,790
would do they would hack into the entire

204
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:09,610
Defense Department network not as a

205
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,860
tabletop exercise they would really do

206
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,170
this and it had to go through a lot of

207
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,030
government lawyers who said okay all

208
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,729
right you can do this but you can't use

209
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,600
any of your classifieds to get stuff

210
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,680
you've got to use us you know

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,050
commercially available hardware and

212
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,540
software so they went out and bought

213
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:30,579
some stuff and they did this and they

214
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,740
proud around the network for a couple of

215
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,960
months and then they gave themselves two

216
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,900
weeks to do this exercise and nobody

217
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,610
knew about it except some very very

218
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,590
senior officials and the people actually

219
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:43,750
doing the hacking it was a no notice

220
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,730
exercise there was the people who would

221
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,490
be hacked would not even know that an

222
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,900
exercise was going on and within two

223
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:54,550
days within I'm sorry within four days

224
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,340
they had hacked into the entire Defense

225
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,140
Department network including the

226
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,690
National Military Command Center which

227
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,520
was the link between the president and

228
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,800
the Secretary of Defense in times of war

229
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,630
and sometimes they would just leave a

230
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,819
little digital marker like you know

231
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,230
Kilroy Was Here

232
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,030
sometimes they would mess with it they

233
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,520
would get into the communications they

234
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:18,339
would send phony messages they would

235
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:25,720
intercept other messages they would

236
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:27,220
flood fax lines and people some people

237
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,350
didn't know that anything was going on

238
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,850
at all other people saw the temping

239
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,530
strange was going on but they didn't

240
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,050
know what it was nobody knew about

241
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,569
hacking if they did know about hacking

242
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:41,109
there were no protocols or procedures

243
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:44,680
for what to do about this the only

244
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,890
person who did anything to stop this was

245
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,810
a marine out in the Pacific who saw that

246
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,819
something strange was happening with

247
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,099
this computer and he just unplugged it

248
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,790
that was all that he knew how to do and

249
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,390
he was the only one who did it

250
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:02,750
during the brief the post-exercise brief

251
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:06,430
to senior officials in the Pentagon this

252
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:09,170
was kind of the first wake-up call and

253
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,290
the Deputy Secretary of Defense said

254
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,030
well who's in charge of course nobody

255
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,250
was in charge so that's when they

256
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:17,810
started to create Joint Task Force

257
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,160
computer network defense

258
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,260
I'm 24/7 watch centers and borrowing

259
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
some of the technologies that was being

260
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,250
handled at the Air Force information

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,770
warfare Center some of the techniques

262
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:35,150
that cliff Stoll invented for his own

263
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:37,460
little adventure that's when it started

264
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,439
and one thing they did was that they

265
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,710
bought a bunch of intrusion detection

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,780
systems which had just started to be

267
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,490
made in a commercial basis and put them

268
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,040
on about a hundred Pentagon computers

269
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:52,280
and what do you think the first thing

270
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,270
that happened was they started detecting

271
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:58,220
intrusions so who knows how long that it

272
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,770
has been going on and in fact you'll be

273
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,360
appreciate this about six weeks into

274
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:04,280
this the Deputy Secretary of Defense

275
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,290
John Hamre called a meeting of the

276
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,560
deputy chiefs and other people to see

277
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,260
how how the igf stuff was was going and

278
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:15,589
this one army one-star general says I

279
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,300
don't I don't know about these IPS

280
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,220
systems I mean ever since we plugged

281
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,459
ever since we plug them in I'm getting

282
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,080
hacked all the time I didn't realize he

283
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,840
had been getting hacked all the time he

284
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,290
just didn't know about it so then all of

285
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,540
a sudden they started detecting things

286
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,719
and one of them they see somebody is

287
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,790
hacking into military networks various

288
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,420
installations there was a crisis going

289
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,400
on with a rock at the time some of the

290
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,079
bases that were being hacked were places

291
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,240
where troops would be deployed from

292
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,370
there was some suspicion that this might

293
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:54,950
be Iraq well then did this the

294
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:56,450
interagency endeavor to monitor and do

295
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:59,270
something about this was called solar

296
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:01,130
sunrise I think now it turned out it was

297
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,210
just two kids from California doing this

298
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:07,100
and some another kid in Israel and some

299
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,430
people said who it's just two kids from

300
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,350
California and other people says

301
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,729
oh Jesus you know but the two kids from

302
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,600
California can do this

303
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,820
what can a dedicated adversary do well

304
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,920
they were about to find out because just

305
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,070
weeks after they kind of shut down the

306
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,420
files on solar sunrise they started

307
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:31,959
getting more hack now this was we're

308
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:34,930
talking 1998 round then 97 98 and this

309
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,209
hacker is a little more persistent in

310
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,680
fact this hacker was doing what would

311
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,439
now be called advanced persistent

312
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,899
threats he's getting into a network or

313
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,330
system poking around trying different

314
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:48,339
things if one Avenue didn't work you

315
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,350
would try another you would look he

316
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,970
wasn't just random he seemed to be

317
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,190
looking for specific pieces of

318
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,029
information he would cover his tracks

319
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,680
when he would leave and there was a lot

320
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,959
of controversy about where this was

321
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,510
coming from but eventually it was pretty

322
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,760
conclusively traced to the Russian

323
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,040
Academy of Sciences server the Russian

324
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,110
cannon now keep in mind this was not

325
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,219
during the Cold War this was during the

326
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,450
heyday of Bill Clinton Boris Yeltsin

327
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:22,839
Bonomi perestroika and Glassman goodwill

328
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:25,660
but this was still going on then after

329
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,060
that couple years later stuff starts

330
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,160
coming in from China one thing

331
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,670
interesting during the eligible receiver

332
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,069
game in 97 one thing that was not stated

333
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,719
in any of the briefing papers is that

334
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,690
while the red team was prowling around

335
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:44,890
the Defense Department networks they saw

336
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:47,110
some IPs of some French eyepiece

337
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,390
floating around in there too they

338
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:52,209
weren't part of the exercise the French

339
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,949
were actually already hacking into

340
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,660
Defense Department networks and you know

341
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,910
they they kicked them out but I mean

342
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,630
this had already begun this was not a

343
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,640
theoretical exercise moonlight maze

344
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,779
which is what they're when they started

345
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,029
looking at this thing that was traced to

346
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,770
the Russian Academy of Sciences that was

347
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,649
Silversun right so this one was

348
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,500
moonlight made moonlight maze is often

349
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,950
called the first foreign intervention

350
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,850
into middle carry networks well maybe it

351
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:22,690
was the first known the first discovered

352
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,600
foreign intervention

353
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:30,670
into porn Network now this actually does

354
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,550
start to set off some alarm down and

355
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,380
around the same time and all of this was

356
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,250
kind of coinciding around the same time

357
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:41,670
again 96 97 98

358
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,990
there was the Oklahoma City bombing and

359
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,849
President Clinton appointed a blue panel

360
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,130
commission to look into the

361
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:50,140
vulnerability of federal facilities and

362
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,570
what we can do about it okay he

363
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,830
appointed some people onto this panel

364
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,420
who had been working the cyber problem

365
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:01,390
for many years many of them in black

366
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,740
programs in the Navy and they convinced

367
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,750
the people who were actually on the

368
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,510
commission that this was the big problem

369
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:09,640
okay yeah somebody might bomb a damn

370
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,319
bomb of Federal Building it's pretty

371
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,390
straightforward what that's about what

372
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,760
you need to present but this was the new

373
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,560
looming problem and there were people in

374
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,160
the White House who were startled and

375
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:24,670
this report is unclassified called the

376
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,579
marsh Commission report more than half

377
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,790
of this long document was dealing with

378
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,800
problems of cyber security and this was

379
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,380
the first time that that phrase had been

380
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,040
used in a public document cybersecurity

381
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,570
somebody on the panel had read

382
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,650
Neuromancer and that that's where it

383
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:46,480
comes from so cyber security and what

384
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,810
these commissioners and their staff had

385
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,700
discovered around this time a bunch of

386
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,209
industries and critical infrastructure

387
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,340
had started getting crazy about the

388
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:59,260
internet and SCADA systems were starting

389
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,080
to be developed and these people who are

390
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,959
doing this had no idea that they were

391
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,520
creating vulnerable systems you know I

392
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,189
was talking with people they would have

393
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,119
some big electrical utility

394
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:14,709
vice-chairman in should be questioned

395
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,379
and they would ask him what are you

396
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,760
doing about security and the guy didn't

397
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,209
know what he was talking about you mean

398
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,490
like sensors around the facilities so

399
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:27,030
nobody gets it they didn't know that

400
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,080
they were creating vulnerabilities

401
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,910
throughout our entire critical

402
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,730
infrastructure nobody knew it was look

403
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,350
you know you can't you can't it's

404
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,030
perfectly understandable and this was

405
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,260
this was great this was good

406
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,550
be convenient it was going to be

407
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,300
efficient it was going to be labor

408
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,580
saving cutting-edge why not let's go

409
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,310
online let's put everything online and

410
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,439
you know we are now where we are at

411
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:52,629
because it is there were countless

412
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,850
reports like this Marsh Commission

413
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,610
report National Academy of Sciences

414
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:02,649
other panels warning about the dangers

415
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:04,719
of this Richard Clark whom I'm sure some

416
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,850
of you know was was the head of

417
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,040
counterterrorism and encounters site

418
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:14,530
where cyber security in the White House

419
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:16,389
he he proposed imposing mandatory cyber

420
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,790
security requirements on critical

421
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,360
infrastructure industries but of course

422
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,540
this was bitterly resisted by the

423
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,740
companies themselves and also by

424
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:29,649
economic advisors in the White House who

425
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:32,350
thought that this would slow down the

426
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:36,430
technology it would it would cramp the

427
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,810
things like speed and thereby weaken our

428
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,160
competitive position in the

429
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,950
international market all of which is

430
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,720
probably true but in the meantime these

431
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,610
vulnerabilities again which had been

432
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,640
warned about first of all 20 years

433
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:54,429
earlier rolled on and rolled on and

434
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:57,610
rolled on finally uh in the Bush

435
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,560
administration and this story will will

436
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:04,389
show many of you that what you're doing

437
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:09,929
is not at all a new thing but is also

438
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:12,880
extremely vital by the by the mid-2000s

439
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:16,270
the NSA had got of what they thought was

440
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,510
a pretty tight lid on military Internet

441
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:21,520
you know it's by this point the various

442
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,810
services and the Defense Department had

443
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,629
whittled down the number of

444
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,270
intersections between MILNET and the

445
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,770
broader Internet to just eight and the

446
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,200
NSA because this was the Defense

447
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:35,080
Department could sit on top of those

448
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,840
eight intersections and monitor traffic

449
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,320
and keep intruders out well at one point

450
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,350
the head of the NSA's information

451
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,790
assurance Directorate said you know what

452
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,159
if somebody's already gotten in there

453
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,409
and they're prowling around let's go

454
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,860
let's go inside see what's going on in

455
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,610
there

456
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,929
and they found a beacon there was a some

457
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:02,139
intruder in the classified networks of

458
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,600
CENTCOM which was the war center for the

459
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,330
wars going on in Iraq and Afghanistan

460
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:12,360
and this isn't just website this was

461
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:12,360
actual operational stuff now the

462
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,330
Diagnostics after the fact discovered

463
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:24,450
that it was probably that there was a

464
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:28,090
bodega outside the US base in Kabul and

465
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,870
the Russians had stalked this bodega

466
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,209
with malware infested thumb drives just

467
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,370
hoping that at some point an American

468
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,860
serviceman or service woman would buy

469
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,500
one of these thumb drives and insert it

470
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,479
in the computer and then they'd be in

471
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,160
and that is precisely what happened they

472
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,780
were waiting around for this to happen

473
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:52,180
and it did and it was at that point well

474
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,860
you know the NSA discovers this on a

475
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,370
Friday afternoon and basically they've

476
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,229
got a solution by Monday morning also by

477
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,810
Monday morning the Defense Department is

478
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,090
sliding around wondering what to do

479
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:07,720
trying to count how many computers are

480
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,510
in tested it was at that point that

481
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,110
Robert Gates who was Secretary of

482
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:16,090
Defense and who'd been you know getting

483
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,689
daily briefings about hacking

484
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:22,209
ever since he took the job realized okay

485
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:24,250
the Pentagon they're they're clueless on

486
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,410
this the NSA seems to know what they're

487
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,900
doing and so he took the advice of

488
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,950
several people over the previous month

489
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,630
and created US Central Command and

490
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,000
created it so that there would be a new

491
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,190
four-star who would be the director of

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,630
NSA and the head of Central Command

493
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,380
because these guys seem to know what

494
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:46,870
they were doing so that's how that began

495
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,600
but here's where we enter into the

496
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,439
problem one of the problem that we have

497
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,169
today the central Cyber Command takes

498
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,750
off you know even now is you know it

499
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,850
started in 2010 even now it's the

500
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,929
fastest-growing element

501
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:07,240
of the Defense Department their

502
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:09,220
infiltrated or integrated with all the

503
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,750
other combatant commands you know

504
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,500
they've got their own targeting plans

505
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,690
within each of the combatant commands

506
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,179
they've got people inside they've

507
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,070
exchanged people war plans targeting

508
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,669
plans all kinds of things but there's no

509
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,740
strategy there's no strategy I mean

510
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:29,200
right now you know the Defense

511
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,360
Department and likelike commercial

512
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,179
industry a lot of it they decided okay

513
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,719
you know what if bad guys want to get in

514
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:39,129
that they're going to get in you know

515
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,830
yes that means it would let's keep

516
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:43,629
building better locks and more protocols

517
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,970
and things like that but the big thing

518
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:47,199
here are the big buzz words in the

519
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,149
Defense Department if some of you

520
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,299
probably know now our deterrence

521
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:54,189
detection and resilience that's the big

522
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,929
thing some of them are making even kind

523
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,289
of radical out of patience for example

524
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,149
in the Navy now they are training

525
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:04,539
sailors and officers on ships to

526
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:07,479
navigate with a sextant navigating by

527
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:10,960
the stars just like centuries ago

528
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,389
because they figure that in a big war at

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,440
some point the data link or the GPS

530
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:18,399
satellites is going to get cut off and

531
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,980
these guys they won't even know where

532
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:22,809
they are much less whether any of their

533
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,379
guided missiles and all the other things

534
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:29,289
that rely on network technology will

535
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:31,750
work so doing section I kind of think

536
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,580
that's what's happening so the change

537
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,169
detection resilience detection and

538
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,509
resilience those are pretty obvious and

539
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:39,549
that's what a lot of you do with with

540
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:42,519
your with your clients but what is the

541
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,200
truth what does that mean you know

542
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:50,710
when the atom bombs exploded in 1945

543
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,259
within a matter of months there were

544
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:56,350
very strategically minded smart people

545
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:58,629
with no security clearances who were

546
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:01,719
asking and coming up with provisional

547
00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:03,939
answers to some very basic questions you

548
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,460
know what is this new weapon in our

549
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:10,450
midst is is this just a bigger version

550
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,370
of a bomb I mean can this be used as a

551
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,080
weapon in war like any other weapon but

552
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,719
which is bigger or is this something

553
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,110
really new is this something that is so

554
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,429
destructive that that there's no war

555
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,250
aims that could justify the

556
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:26,230
destructiveness that it wreaks and if

557
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,940
that's the case we have to start

558
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,909
thinking as one of the strategists back

559
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,889
then put it not how to win wars but how

560
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:34,929
to prevent them so how do we do that and

561
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,269
they came up with the whole theories of

562
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,049
you know survivable second strike

563
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,480
capability

564
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:42,460
retaliation and kind this sort of thing

565
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,879
which which hasn't you know see these

566
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,090
concepts have endured even now with

567
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:52,059
cyber there was none of it none of it

568
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:54,399
why well you know with the bomb there

569
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,809
was some things that were classified but

570
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:57,549
a lot of things weren't first there was

571
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,010
there was video footage you could see

572
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,100
the damage that this thing did you could

573
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:06,309
you know you looked at being incinerated

574
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,649
Hiroshima and Nagasaki it was known

575
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,539
there was the Smyth report which said

576
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:12,760
that this is all has something to do

577
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,820
with uranium there were published

578
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,980
reports about who has uranium mines you

579
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,080
could do calculations of based on all

580
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,480
this roughly how many of these weapons

581
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,939
various countries could build over a

582
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,389
certain amount of time so you got all

583
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,039
these things that a strategic analyst

584
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:31,719
who is just smart and strategically

585
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,940
minded and you didn't necessarily have

586
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,940
any security clearances to come up with

587
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,720
some ideas there is nothing about this

588
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:43,119
in cyber because until very recently

589
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:47,070
everything about the field was smothered

590
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:49,570
in very very high security

591
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,519
classification or the old joke that in

592
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,908
killed the 70s you know the joke was

593
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:57,220
that NSA stands for no such agency there

594
00:25:54,909 --> 00:26:02,070
all of it was classified most of it

595
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:05,950
still is it was just Obama recently who

596
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:07,629
Declassified the fact that we that the

597
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,779
United States was conducting cyber

598
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:14,379
offensive operations that that even that

599
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:17,019
basic fact was classified and killed

600
00:26:14,379 --> 00:26:18,699
just a few years ago and by the way just

601
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:22,299
to back up a little bit the story I told

602
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,020
you about Reagan's document its first NS

603
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:25,420
DD

604
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,580
I talked at some point with somebody who

605
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,050
was involved in writing it and he said

606
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,620
to me and remember this was a document

607
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:35,320
written in 1984 he said you know here's

608
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:38,590
what you have to keep in mind all these

609
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,510
scenarios and threats that have been

610
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:46,449
laid out it was a presidential document

611
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:48,600
these were all mere images of what we

612
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,850
were already doing to other countries

613
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:55,959
that's what the NSA does that's what the

614
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:59,800
black navy was doing so although a lot

615
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,050
of public discussion of this field is

616
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,080
always in terms of the threat the

617
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:08,559
Russians Chinese Iran Ian's North Korean

618
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,389
whatever we've been engaged in the same

619
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,809
thing I mean not with the same targets

620
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,980
you know we don't need to steal Chinese

621
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,260
aircraft designs because they're

622
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,809
basically designs that they've already

623
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,240
stolen from us you know we don't need to

624
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:24,670
go hack into banking accounts like North

625
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:29,670
Koreans do yo we don't need it but

626
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:32,890
getting into you know military stuff

627
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:35,170
critical infrastructure where we're

628
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,690
doing we're doing the same thing but

629
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:41,230
what is deterrence what is the tearing I

630
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,510
mean even basic questions like what what

631
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,400
is the government trying to deter like

632
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:49,150
let's say there is a cyber attack on a

633
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,190
bank is that something that the United

634
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,860
States government should be concerned

635
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,720
about it and do something about about to

636
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,790
banks how about six things how about an

637
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,280
electrical plant in Chicago at what

638
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:06,700
point does the government even take a

639
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,850
role of position on this you would as a

640
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,240
threat and then once you figure out what

641
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,620
that is what do you do about it what do

642
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,679
you do about it I mean some of these

643
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,360
countries or entities that are or sue

644
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,690
will be capable of launching attacks

645
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,590
like these they're not terribly wired up

646
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,010
themselves

647
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:29,139
so what is retaliation in kind you know

648
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:32,350
it's like we have we have the most

649
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:34,330
powerful and agile Locke to throw out

650
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,250
other people's houses but we're living

651
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,830
in the Glass House

652
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:41,710
the mall we can have a lot of damage can

653
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,980
be done to us as you all know with a

654
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,780
relatively unsophisticated attack so

655
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,929
what do we do about this and then what

656
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,700
what is day two or day three look like

657
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:53,770
how do you how do you do what the

658
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,010
nuclear strategist called escalation

659
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,539
control what is your retaliation and how

660
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,950
is it how can you design it in such a

661
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:05,289
way that it puts an end instead of just

662
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,210
ratcheting it up nobody has thought

663
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:09,158
there have been attempts to think about

664
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,260
this but nobody has thought it through

665
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:12,940
mainly because the kind of people who

666
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,020
might be very good at thinking it

667
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,220
through don't have the clearances and

668
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,280
therefore I get until very recently

669
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,799
wouldn't have even known what questions

670
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,918
to ask wouldn't have known the

671
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:28,720
capabilities that exist on all sides and

672
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,909
therefore wouldn't have been able to

673
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,250
outline the nature of the threat would

674
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:36,850
be endurance in the threat that sort of

675
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,919
thing in the meantime you know the very

676
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,629
first is Marsh Commission study which

677
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,549
was the first official document that

678
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,850
laid out the problem and they were

679
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,168
talking about critical infrastructure

680
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,090
nothing has been done about critical and

681
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:53,289
what not nothing but nothing systematic

682
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:59,590
there are no mandatory security

683
00:29:53,289 --> 00:30:01,270
requirement bush-obama they wrote can

684
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,280
vary they sign some interesting

685
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:05,020
executive orders which did some

686
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,940
interesting things but there's almost

687
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,520
always a line in the executive order

688
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,130
someplace which say at the insistence by

689
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,990
the way of the bureaucracy and the

690
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,390
commercial companies that owned the

691
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,720
Internet none of this shall be

692
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,419
interpreted to require security

693
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,419
requirement you know Obama created a

694
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:28,059
federal seizo seemed like a great idea

695
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:31,240
you have one person who has the

696
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:34,360
authority for information security for

697
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,820
the entire federal government there is

698
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,799
one problem this person was not given

699
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,530
the authority in the executive order or

700
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:45,970
in any other document to hire people to

701
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:48,070
fire people if you walk into some you

702
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,330
know backwater division of the Interior

703
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,610
Department instead

704
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:54,939
and saw they were still using Windows XP

705
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,629
you couldn't say I am taking you off the

706
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,180
internet

707
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:02,830
until you update your systems you have

708
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:05,530
no power to do this and therefore it's

709
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,639
you know it's kind of nonsense there

710
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,850
were those in the Clinton administration

711
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,410
they've curated these ice ax information

712
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,860
sharing and analysis centers for each

713
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,930
sector a critical infrastructure and and

714
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,479
as you know some sectors have actually

715
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:22,330
taken this very seriously banking and

716
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,480
finance for example why well you know

717
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,220
this is core mission stuff to them this

718
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,350
is part of their core mission you know

719
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,260
they need your money they need your

720
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:34,060
trust and they have money so they can

721
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,040
hire really good people they get hacked

722
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,800
there's a zillion times a day but there

723
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,980
most of them are on top of it and they

724
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,680
clean up the mess pretty quickly

725
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,900
electrical paddler on the other hand

726
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,290
this is theoretical yeah you know ever

727
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,200
since the Aurora generator test which

728
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,550
was during the Bush administration

729
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,300
they've everybody's known about the

730
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,139
vulnerability of power generators and

731
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,350
grids

732
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,600
in this kind of attack but most of them

733
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,969
have again much why well you know it

734
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,590
hasn't happened yet

735
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:12,820
unlike banks which do get hacked all the

736
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:15,970
time it costs a lot of money to do

737
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,820
something about this some of them made

738
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:21,610
the calculation that their cost from

739
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:25,540
taking preventive measures isn't that

740
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:27,219
much more expensive than think it's not

741
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:29,020
much cheaper than than cleaning up a

742
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,300
mess afterwards so what is the incentive

743
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,100
and then not only that but you know the

744
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,409
government is asking them to adopt best

745
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,540
practices well you know today's best

746
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,240
practices might be tomorrow's futile

747
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,100
gesture so they're basically saying so

748
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,660
you mean that in a year I'm going to

749
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,909
have to do all this I'm gonna have to do

750
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,650
it all over again so you know bothering

751
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,420
and they look at the ISACA membership

752
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:51,550
kind of the way that some people look at

753
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,430
you know belonging to a gym you know I

754
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:57,129
signed up I signed up to join the gym I

755
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,500
I really have to go exercise there three

756
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,990
times a week they'd say well you know I

757
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,560
hear I got the I went to the ice shack

758
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,750
meeting

759
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,590
last week yo yeah I'm on top of it don't

760
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,840
worry about it

761
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:11,230
but what is what is critical

762
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,379
infrastructure even I mean I don't think

763
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:17,620
too many people would have guessed that

764
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:22,500
the first time an American president

765
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:27,060
made a public statement identifying a

766
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:30,670
hacker into some American facility and

767
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:32,950
saying that we will retaliate against

768
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:35,530
this in a manner and a time of our

769
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,330
choosing I don't think too many people

770
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:39,490
would have guessed that this would have

771
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:44,230
been about North Korea's hacking of Sony

772
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:49,750
Pictures over a movie over kind of a

773
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:50,980
funny but dumb movies that's what you

774
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,720
know I don't think North Korea would

775
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,640
have predicted that such a fuss would be

776
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,560
made about this and now here's where

777
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,950
things can get kind of dangerous you

778
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,159
might recall that about three days after

779
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:05,710
Obama made that statement North Korea

780
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,320
was disconnected from the internet for

781
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,909
about ten hours and it doesn't take

782
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,770
rocket science to do that lead they've

783
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,260
got about a thousand IPS all of them

784
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,330
hooked up to one server in China not a

785
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,560
big deal well it turns out and North

786
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:22,509
Korea thought and everybody assumed that

787
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,570
this was the American retaliation in

788
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,830
fact I mean I can tell you for a fact

789
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,200
the United States government had nothing

790
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:32,710
to do with that had nothing to do with

791
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:35,290
that but let's say that North Korea had

792
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:39,490
more robust cyber offensive capabilities

793
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:40,389
and let's say they assumed and it's a

794
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,979
safe assumption

795
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,960
you would have think that this was the

796
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,940
American retaliation they might have

797
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,310
done a counter retaliation and then

798
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,409
where does the same you know there was

799
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,639
where the title of my book comes from

800
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,159
dark territory

801
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,440
hey I've written five books and each

802
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,840
time I say well the title will emerge in

803
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,760
my notes and it never does but this time

804
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,680
it did emerge from my notes I was going

805
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,710
over my notes and I saw when I

806
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,660
interviewed Bob gates he told me that

807
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,130
when he first got into the Pentagon and

808
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,670
was getting all these briefings about

809
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:15,060
hacks he would tell some of his uh his

810
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:18,080
associates he would say you know

811
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,730
we really have to get together with our

812
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,040
the other major cyber powers and work

813
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,930
out some rules of the road you know when

814
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,029
he was director of the CIA during the

815
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,680
darkest period of the Cold War there

816
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,450
were rules the Americans and Soviets

817
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,759
they had some rules like we won't kill

818
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,430
each other spies we need to get together

819
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,220
and do something like that because we

820
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,770
are all wandering in dark territory I

821
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,689
said wow that's title of my book but

822
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,180
then I wanted to look up to see if it

823
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,880
had any meaning that I didn't want to be

824
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,930
covered the book and turned out that

825
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,550
it's a term of art to describe it's a

826
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,680
term of art from early North American

827
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,770
railroads to describe stretches of track

828
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,629
that were not governed by signals and

829
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,520
thinking wow that's that's a powerful

830
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,700
metaphor that that's what the internet

831
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,370
is

832
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,319
so I sent a note to I sent an email to

833
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:10,980
gates and asked them did you know this

834
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:13,110
and he said oh yeah yeah my grandfather

835
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,270
was a stationmaster in Santa Fe Railroad

836
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,890
for 50 years we talked railroad

837
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,460
terminology around the house all the

838
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,370
time

839
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,440
so he understood the depth of the

840
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,600
problem that we're all wandering in dark

841
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,930
territory and there's just one other

842
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,190
thing

843
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:31,230
remember wargames when the guys who are

844
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,450
writing working to by the way also wrote

845
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:36,840
sneakers which also had some impact

846
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,580
which you can read about they were

847
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,470
writing organs and they wanted to make

848
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,270
it at least plausible so they were

849
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,390
thinking God you know is it plausible

850
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:47,490
that a kid could just dial up the NORAD

851
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,910
computer I mean it would not be a closed

852
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,740
system so they live in Santa Monica they

853
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,120
called up RAND Corporation public

854
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,129
affairs thinking somebody they'll not be

855
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,470
able to help out I said oh yeah you want

856
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,090
to go see Willis winter so they went to

857
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:03,330
see Willis where the guy who wrote the

858
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,970
paper in 1967 and they presented the

859
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,770
problem to him and he said yeah you know

860
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,470
I actually designed the software for

861
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,360
that computer the real computer he goes

862
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,980
yeah yeah you're right it is a closed

863
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,920
system but you know your thing there's

864
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,470
always some officer who wants to work

865
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,140
from home over the weekend so they leave

866
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,660
a port open and yeah I guess if a kid

867
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,549
just dialed into that port he would get

868
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,569
in and then he leaned forward and he

869
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,880
said something that all of you know is

870
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,580
true and that the entire world is now

871
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,780
knowing to be true and that you can sort

872
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:40,750
of adopt feel free to adopt this as your

873
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:44,620
slogan we said look here's the thing the

874
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:48,490
only completely secure computer it's a

875
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,290
computer that no one can use so that's

876
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,180
the situation that we're in it dates

877
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:56,259
back to the very beginning of the

878
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,910
internet it is inherent in the nature of

879
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,770
the Internet and unless it all gets

880
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,609
blown up and we start all over again

881
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:05,500
that's the world that you're trying to

882
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:16,960
fix things and thank you very much and

883
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:21,900
I'll take questions I can't see very

884
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:24,190
well because of these lights but I'm

885
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,220
assuming that somebody is going to a

886
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:30,430
micro mic is coming for them you

887
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,799
mentioned the rules that existed between

888
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,509
the u.s. and the Soviets like we don't

889
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,530
kill each other spies yeah

890
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,180
how are those negotiating that's a good

891
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:42,760
question

892
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,460
I think a lot of them are just sort of

893
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,100
implicit although you know it might be

894
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,450
more than there might have been what you

895
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,230
know I don't know that very good I

896
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,419
should look into that

897
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,430
thank you I think there might be more

898
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,260
negotiations of the sort than I thought

899
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,930
I remember one time about 30 years ago

900
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,120
when I was up a pentagon reporter I

901
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:03,250
walked into some guy's office he was

902
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,859
involved in foreign little carriage

903
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,710
sales and he had kind of a what looks

904
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:11,260
like a weird trophy on his desk and I

905
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,990
said oh and he was a public affairs guy

906
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:17,230
for the office of a foreign military

907
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:20,560
show what sure yes oh oh that's and it

908
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,630
turned out he had won this award all the

909
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,330
propaganda offices of the various

910
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:27,970
militaries us-soviet everybody

911
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:29,049
they had like an annual Film Festival

912
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,359
where they showed each other's

913
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:34,750
propaganda films and gave out awards for

914
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,120
them I mean who knew so you know there

915
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:38,040
could be all these kind of secret kabobs

916
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,470
and

917
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,400
and convergences and communities that

918
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,779
that are even enemies but that have a

919
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,430
grudging respect for each other and they

920
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:52,710
have like a it's also the other thing

921
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:55,649
about rules were the u.s. and the

922
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:57,750
Soviets I mean they have a it was just

923
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,730
them it was just two guys you know two

924
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,330
countries that controlled the rest of

925
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,490
the world

926
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:05,970
the problem with sight even when anyone

927
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:08,580
Gates you know mentioned let's do rules

928
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:11,100
of the road for cyber at that time there

929
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,140
were maybe five countries that had the

930
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,240
ability to do any of this stuff you

931
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,069
might have been able to do something you

932
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,779
know US Russia China France England

933
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:27,170
Israel you know but when you're going to

934
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:30,570
do about Iran and North Korea Syria and

935
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:32,940
who knows what non-state entities are

936
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,810
working this stuff up how are you going

937
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,840
to put together a Congress of Vienna to

938
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:42,450
to make some kind of massive treaty on

939
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,410
that I don't know if it's that one of

940
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:48,089
those greater challenges of our time so

941
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,859
I have to have a two-part question over

942
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,050
here I don't know them right over here

943
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,240
is but you're right get audio I see okay

944
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,890
yeah yeah fire that works too so hey

945
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,810
I've got a two-part question the first

946
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:00,420
first part has to do with the shadow

947
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:02,279
brokers and vault 7 leaks since your

948
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,870
books been published we know vastly more

949
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,730
about the government nation state

950
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,710
hacking than we did before and kind of

951
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,330
dovetailing on you know do the original

952
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,540
question and it was asked here a second

953
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,880
ago

954
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:15,120
how do you think that the cyber

955
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,930
operations spies being outed currently

956
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,700
how do you think that's going to play

957
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:23,069
out with nation-states so you have a

958
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,259
second question - oh no that was all the

959
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,060
time I tell you like yeah the leaks

960
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,370
are rather outing right right yeah well

961
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,290
I my guess is that a lot of you probably

962
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,589
have better answers to that one than I

963
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,529
do

964
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:36,210
I don't well you know this is part of

965
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,360
the problem there and there how it plays

966
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:43,710
out I mean one thing that's happening

967
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:45,810
that has a kind of strangely salutary

968
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,260
effect is that a lot of the mistakes

969
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:51,049
that we made in like

970
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:53,270
the entire critical infrastructure been

971
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,130
controlled by you know skated networks

972
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:58,009
and this kind of thing other countries

973
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:00,619
have done things Russia's done this too

974
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,619
china's started to do it and so there's

975
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:06,740
this kind of de facto mutually assured

976
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:10,250
destruction situation that that's

977
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:12,680
developed where we're all almost equally

978
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:16,100
vulnerable at least in certain respects

979
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,359
now if there's a danger to that though

980
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,850
these would mutually assured destruction

981
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,190
with nukes you know it takes a half an

982
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:24,950
hour for a missile to get from Russia to

983
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,990
the United States or whatever this stuff

984
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:29,210
you're already inside I mean that's the

985
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:32,560
real danger of it's one of the real

986
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:35,300
dangers of the fine fine line between

987
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,920
computer network exploitation and

988
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,960
computing Network attack they're

989
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,150
basically the same thing except for the

990
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,520
final step so you're it's one thing to

991
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,060
be you know inside other people's

992
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,310
systems for espionage you know just like

993
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,410
we have spies inside foreign counsels we

994
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:54,080
have digital spies inside foreign

995
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,920
networks but this would be as if the spy

996
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,590
was carrying a mini nuke in his backpack

997
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:02,450
because the once you're in you can mess

998
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:06,350
with it you can you can destroy it and

999
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:10,129
if both sides of all sides are in each

1000
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:14,000
other's networks then ever crisis

1001
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:16,280
develops and we're all getting

1002
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,859
increasingly dependent on these things

1003
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:21,640
in our middle carry and our society and

1004
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:25,850
our economy there will be pressures on

1005
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,009
all sides to launch a preemptive strike

1006
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:30,529
before the other side launches a

1007
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,650
preemptive strike and we're already

1008
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:36,380
inside the preparations have been made

1009
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,230
we've mapped out the whole thing it can

1010
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:43,580
be done with the push of a button or the

1011
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:45,080
command key so that's in a nuclear game

1012
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,380
they used to call this crisis and

1013
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,549
stability where the most vulnerable

1014
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:53,210
assets were also the most destructive

1015
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:56,119
assets you know verbs ICBMs so there was

1016
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,490
pressure in a crisis to launch those

1017
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,500
ICBMs before the other side launched his

1018
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:03,020
eyes against to destroy the ice again

1019
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,450
before he destroys us the same thing

1020
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:10,580
inside would be mutually inside each

1021
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:14,060
other's networks so unless some way then

1022
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,950
Congress of Vienna can be created where

1023
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:20,000
certain targets are certain systems

1024
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:23,750
you're just off limit you know I think I

1025
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,810
think that the dangers are probably

1026
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:28,310
greater than the than the security

1027
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:32,810
benefits of having this mutual

1028
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:37,279
vulnerability so over here on your left

1029
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:39,740
sir room over here yep what you wrapped

1030
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,540
up the last question with is the

1031
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:45,049
beginning of my question you started to

1032
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:46,490
talk about how the different branches

1033
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:49,220
are talking about how they're going to

1034
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,868
operate without our technology teaching

1035
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,819
people how to navigate with sex things

1036
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:55,820
like it's that gun losing your kind of

1037
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:58,880
alright so the question is have you seen

1038
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:02,810
a trend inside of you did your research

1039
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,910
of all of the organizations going back

1040
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,040
like the pendulum swinging away from

1041
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,569
technology and self sustainment without

1042
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,450
being connected to the network is that

1043
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:15,589
finally happening now it's happening a

1044
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:17,839
little bit you know the Navy is doing

1045
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:19,460
some of this maybe because the Navy has

1046
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,549
always been a bit ahead of the other

1047
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:24,560
services the Air Force is doing some of

1048
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,320
it there are some air wings or even air

1049
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,930
divisions where they take as they

1050
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:33,290
determine how many planes or whatever

1051
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:35,960
are needed to perform the minimal

1052
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:37,279
mission requirements and they take that

1053
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,380
many airplanes and they put it

1054
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,450
separately I mean they they keep it as

1055
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:47,119
offline as possible the army as far as I

1056
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,669
know hasn't done anything and in fact

1057
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,609
even going back to that 97 wargame

1058
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:56,599
eligible receiver the army didn't take

1059
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:58,940
part partly because they knew that they

1060
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,250
were terribly vulnerable and partly

1061
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,960
because they didn't care so they they

1062
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,030
they'd kidnap where we're not going to

1063
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,430
play this game so they were left out of

1064
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,680
the whole thing and therefore when a lot

1065
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:12,020
of the other services you know had their

1066
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,589
holy moment and started patching

1067
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,600
things up

1068
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,630
the army the army was much slower to do

1069
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:23,940
that so yeah it's very patchy there is

1070
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:26,780
not a Defense Department wide dedicated

1071
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:30,330
effort to do something about this and

1072
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:31,470
and yeah the the the planes that they're

1073
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,110
building and the missiles they're

1074
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,350
designing and so forth rely on network

1075
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,730
technology every bit as much as as

1076
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:41,490
weapons that were being designed a

1077
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,500
decade or two ago that hasn't nobody

1078
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,859
said let's develop this so that you know

1079
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,440
the GPS is cut off

1080
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,810
you know the missile still lands what

1081
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,070
we're aiming it hasn't hasn't really

1082
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,080
happened to the degree or the

1083
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:57,210
communications or you know the thing is

1084
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,240
when they've been told that when they

1085
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:03,210
when they're done wargames we're command

1086
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:07,620
control vulnerability is being tested

1087
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:13,350
the red team always gets in they always

1088
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:15,630
get in so that's kind of concerning well

1089
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:18,750
I have a question over here other side

1090
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:22,950
second row I'll believe you

1091
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:24,780
yeah as the prevalence of more and more

1092
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,029
sophisticated Acker groups such as well

1093
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,060
sac and Maine any other hacker group

1094
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:33,240
increases and they engage in larger

1095
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:36,360
Network exploits at what point does the

1096
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:38,640
government have to start actually taking

1097
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:41,880
them as at their own nation-state and as

1098
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,520
their own actors and recognizing them

1099
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:47,970
and engaging them at what point does

1100
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,680
that threshold exist well you know we

1101
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,779
can all sit around and talking about

1102
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,029
treating your question as a theoretical

1103
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,710
question and you know someone like Dick

1104
00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:00,540
Clark would have said we should have

1105
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:04,860
been doing this in 1996 at what point

1106
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:08,340
will it start to happen I think you know

1107
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,110
after a major disaster after you know

1108
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:16,260
the lights get turned out on the eastern

1109
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:19,500
seaboard or after you know some the Fed

1110
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:22,980
gets raided or you know I think I think

1111
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:25,500
it's going to take some major disaster I

1112
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,710
mean look look at all the things going

1113
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,369
on in counterterrorism

1114
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,349
after September 11th I mean if those if

1115
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:34,950
the people who pulled off that attack

1116
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:36,910
tried to do it now in the same way

1117
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:40,180
there's no way they would have been able

1118
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:42,549
to do it you know steps have been taken

1119
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,140
the Oklahoma City bombing you know you

1120
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,849
used to be able to go to a fertilizer

1121
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,710
store and buy all this stuff

1122
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:51,880
you can't do that anymore so I think

1123
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:56,950
yeah it's going to take something and

1124
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:58,660
you know a greater obstacle still is you

1125
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,339
know as you know the Internet is

1126
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,279
basically controlled by private entities

1127
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:04,299
and you know they'd either have to be

1128
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,050
nationalized

1129
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,970
or severe mandatory security

1130
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,710
requirements put on top of it and and

1131
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:14,740
even after a big crisis there's going to

1132
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:16,390
be a lot of resistance to that you know

1133
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,830
I was talking with somebody last night

1134
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,480
and I was talking about Internet of

1135
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:25,720
Things and I said what if one of you uh

1136
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:27,820
made a law right now that all internet

1137
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,118
technology devices they couldn't be

1138
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:32,950
activated until you change the password

1139
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,930
you know that step alone would would

1140
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:38,109
greatly minimize the degree to which

1141
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:40,690
someone can just rally you know ten

1142
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:44,290
million baby monitors and and use them

1143
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:46,480
as box to send denial of service attacks

1144
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,670
to a big network and you said yeah but

1145
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,230
you know then people nobody's going to

1146
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:52,810
want to buy them nobody will know how to

1147
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,820
use them you know well maybe somebody

1148
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,380
has to say well tough you are you

1149
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,470
cannot own one of these you know you

1150
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,230
can't buy a car unless you pass the

1151
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:04,000
driver's test well you can't buy one of

1152
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,780
these devices until you know how to

1153
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,359
change a password you know why can't the

1154
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,190
computer companies devisor software or

1155
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:14,980
hardware that when you get a message

1156
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,589
saying you know there's been a security

1157
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:20,609
problem please install this software

1158
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:24,130
update to repair it most people don't

1159
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:25,598
but what if a flashing red light rose on

1160
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,460
the screen just like when you get in the

1161
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,640
car and you don't fasten seatbelts and

1162
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,950
it goes ding ding ding ding ding and it

1163
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,390
keeps doing that and you finally fasten

1164
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,259
the seatbelt so though I should drive

1165
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:40,500
yourself up what happens is

1166
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,960
the flashing red light until you install

1167
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,300
the damn upgrade or that there were

1168
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,680
certain functions in the computer that

1169
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:52,740
you couldn't use until you upgraded it

1170
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,118
I'm not I know these are feasible they'd

1171
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,859
probably have their own drawback

1172
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,250
somebody could start sending phony

1173
00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:01,440
upgrades to as back as malware to get

1174
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:03,599
into your system but I mean it's kind of

1175
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,750
startling that this long into this

1176
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,329
history each of us doesn't have some

1177
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,400
intrusion detection system in our own

1178
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:13,380
computer you know by this time if it had

1179
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,359
started at the beginning you could have

1180
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:18,990
gotten con amis of scale down to make

1181
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:20,490
these things tribute so a lot of things

1182
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:24,118
could have happened I think it will take

1183
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:26,598
a disaster to to get people really

1184
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:26,599
moving on

1185
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,590
