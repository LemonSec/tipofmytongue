1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,436
(soothing music)

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,344
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,448
- Alright so, I've got
something to take care of here.

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,384
There's about five or
six people in this room

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:21,755
that know what's going on
so just give me one minute.

6
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,625
I got a mystery presentation
that has been across

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:29,596
several thousand miles,
great amount of planning,

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,998
great amount of logistics
that went into this

9
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,634
and I'll get into all the
details of it in just a moment,

10
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,872
but I promise that it's worth
your wait and as we kind

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:43,143
of close out her for the
summit, I think you'll

12
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,178
be very happy with it.

13
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:49,248
So first and foremost,
before anything else,

14
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,917
absolutely awesome summit and
I hope you really enjoyed it.

15
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:52,419
I absolutely enjoyed it.

16
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,254
I opened up by saying this
is one of the very few

17
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:57,323
events I absolutely
refuse to miss every year

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,527
and certainly had no
regrets whatsoever

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,897
about spending the
time here this week.

20
00:01:04,897 --> 00:01:08,301
And the organization
that puts this together

21
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,103
is more than just the
people you see up here.

22
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,372
You got people in the back
keeping the AV running.

23
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,675
You've got people who are
making sure that this event

24
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,846
is gonna be on our YouTube
channel after the fact,

25
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,083
that you're gonna
have great comms here.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,884
Josh Johnson, who makes
sure that our comms work.

27
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,687
There's somebody
behind the scenes.

28
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,054
You don't necessarily see them.

29
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,057
So please, when you see
them on the way out,

30
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,959
high five 'em, tell
them thank you because

31
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,496
they busted their asses
making this the great event

32
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,464
for the past two days.

33
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,835
(audience applauds)

34
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:45,104
And one of the reasons
I like this event is

35
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:49,576
it reminds me a lot of
family because we have

36
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:53,113
some of these events that
I see people coming back to

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,382
year after year and
I love to see that.

38
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,986
Seeing people weeks
and months beforehand,

39
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:02,355
kind of getting excited
about it and saying

40
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,290
I can't wait for this
talk, I can't wait to see

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,226
somebody again, somebody
who maybe can't make it

42
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,728
because of work contributions,
seeing everybody say

43
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,196
ah, I'm gonna miss and
I'm crushed about it

44
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,666
and you know what, as
much as we are upset that

45
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,136
they can't make it, it's
cool to see that they want to

46
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,239
and certainly that is, I
think, a really big thing.

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,574
But this is the kind of thing
I like to see on Facebook

48
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,743
and Twitter and everybody
posting these pictures.

49
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,745
It reminded me of a
family reunion and as with

50
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,780
a lot of family-like
organizations, there's gonna be

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,283
somebody who's seen as
kind of the focal point

52
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,552
of the organization, the
matriarch, the patriarch,

53
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,686
somebody who's kind of
the one that everybody

54
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,656
wants to make sure they come,
they see, they hang out with

55
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,059
and of course, in our case,
I'm pretty sure we know

56
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,528
that that's gonna be Rob Lee.

57
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,998
And as we know, I like
to get my revenge,

58
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,333
but I get revenge in very
interesting and fun ways.

59
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,370
So this is the 10th
year this summit.

60
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,540
That's a huge, huge
accomplishment and you know,

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,243
I want you to realize that even
though that's 10 years old,

62
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:00,647
that's just a little bit
more than half of the time

63
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,117
that DFIR has existed
here at SANS in some way

64
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,819
shape or form and it wasn't
that long ago that the entirety

65
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,989
of what is now SANS DFIR was
Rob and way back in the day,

66
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,262
17 years ago, DFIR started.

67
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,369
Does anybody remember what
it was called when we began?

68
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,904
Track 8, yes.

69
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,040
17 imaginary points
to Hal Pomeranz.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,275
I did research on Track 8
and I really wanted to come

71
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,878
up with a cover of
the book for it.

72
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,279
I couldn't, but the only thing
I could find was actually

73
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,716
this, which is still
live on the SANS website,

74
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,518
which we're gonna have
to take a look at,

75
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,988
but it was the precourse
questionnaire for getting

76
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,357
into Track 6 and Track 8
and you'll see it was called

77
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,694
System Forensics,
Investigations and Response

78
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,998
and that was it, that was
the investigative class

79
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,435
and Rob was writing
that, again 17 years ago.

80
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,570
But the reason this was
revolutionary is because

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,406
it brought what was one
of the very first classes

82
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,910
to light that focused
on methodologies.

83
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,311
It was not what
was typically seen

84
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,649
in the tool-based training
where we had someone who,

85
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,551
you know, was
teaching their tool,

86
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,085
which could be very
capable of course,

87
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,687
but they're saying here's
the workflow we've created

88
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,257
and here's the tool
we've created to
address that workflow.

89
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,423
Track 8 was different.

90
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:20,493
Track 8 said here's
how to think.

91
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,995
You're gonna see challenges
you've never seen before.

92
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,963
We're going to teach
you how to think.

93
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,798
And that was very,
very different.

94
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,202
I'm so glad to see, finally,
you know, taking hold

95
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,170
in great strides
across the organization

96
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,140
and across the
community as a whole.

97
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,243
One of the things Rob
also brought to that

98
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,813
was absolute pure
unadulterated enthusiasm.

99
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,419
So for that, I'm gonna have to
ask you to come up here, Rob.

100
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,254
Come on.

101
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,659
Because Rob's
enthusiasm is something

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,628
that was baked into
every single slide.

103
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,198
You know, you can buy
your seat here this week,

104
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,366
taken a class from Rob, but
you're only going to need

105
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:05,104
the edge because he will
be this all over the place

106
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,539
and it's gonna be awesome
and one of the things

107
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,010
that he really, really
kind of shies away

108
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,414
from is the
spotlight, ironically,

109
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,649
although we have
six of them on us.

110
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,652
So I'm really happy
to share this with you

111
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,255
and try to do my absolute
best to embarrass you

112
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,457
in the best possible way
because we've got something

113
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,726
cooking up for you right here.

114
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,696
There's a ripple effect
beyond this though because

115
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,265
what Rob's actually built is
not actually a curriculum.

116
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,267
He's actually built a team
that espouses that same

117
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,469
kind of enthusiasm, that same
kind of fervor that he has.

118
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,240
And when I was getting this
ready, I asked other instructors

119
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,142
for some comments and I
asked them two questions,

120
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,113
very broad, very
open-ended questions.

121
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,515
We're just getting started.

122
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,151
There's no chair here because
I didn't want you to relax.

123
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,519
So I asked them two questions.

124
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,956
I said number one, tell
me what Rob was in terms

125
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,425
of your career progression,
in terms of your being

126
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,394
where you are right now,
but more importantly,

127
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,830
the one I was most
interested in is tell me

128
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,931
what you've seen Rob do for
the community as a whole

129
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:09,068
and those two things gave
me this incredibly cool view

130
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,739
into that which is DFIR
as we know it today

131
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,108
and I'm going to read these
verbatim because I think

132
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,443
the words are very powerful
and I don't want to

133
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,546
overlook or misstate anything.

134
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,717
First of all, Sarah Edwards
had said Rob encouraged me

135
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,256
to write and teach a full course
when I was scared to death

136
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,859
to speak in front of people
and now obviously you see

137
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,861
Sarah's out and about in front
of everybody like there's

138
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,562
no problem with that.

139
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,464
She said that
although I kept saying

140
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,199
I wasn't going to teach,

141
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,903
he kept saying yes you
will and certainly you see

142
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,740
now that's a second thought
and this is not advancing again

143
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,309
so we'll have to
figure that one out.

144
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,247
Second one though,
Heather Mulholland said

145
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,483
Rob not only makes you
recognize your rockstar

146
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,952
capabilities, he
makes you use them.

147
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,921
It's not enough to know things.

148
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,156
How does it matter?

149
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,425
How does it take hold
in your casework?

150
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,361
How does it take hold
in your daily lives?

151
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,363
That's something that's
very important too because

152
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,432
you can be great at what
you do, and unless you're

153
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,001
using and exercising that
muscle, sometimes might

154
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,570
not necessarily be
the best use there.

155
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,840
Hal Pomeranz says that Rob
got me my first professional

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,876
forensics gig and many others

157
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,578
in the industry
could say the same.

158
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,179
I'm in that same
boat, absolutely.

159
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,516
And he said through him,
I've also met countless

160
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,485
people who have help
advanced my career,

161
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,720
that network building,
that family building.

162
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,523
You need to talk to this
other person because.

163
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,792
Seeing those connections
before they're put together.

164
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,195
That's something that
is absolutely critical.

165
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,596
Eric Zimmerman.

166
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,097
Congratulations Eric.

167
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,000
Rob has helped me tune and
tweak my forensic tools

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,337
to be more user-friendly
and consistent.

169
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,840
Our tools are only as good

170
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,340
as the information
they provide us.

171
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,477
We, I like to say in class,
the human beings made of meat

172
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,378
are the ones that bring meaning
to whatever the tools say.

173
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,082
So the tool can say great
information and unless it's

174
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,650
easy for us human
beings to consume,

175
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,419
it's gonna be a little
difficult for us to come up

176
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,756
with those good findings
and then lastly, Robert Lee,

177
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:14,126
the other one, yes, we
like Rob so much here

178
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,296
we actually manufactured a
second one, said, and I quote,

179
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,970
"Rob is the godfather of
modern digital forensics

180
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,974
"and having the same name
as him made me proud."

181
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,911
(audience laughs and applauds)

182
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:38,317
Now, we contemplated
actually making other Rob

183
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,188
change his name and he
said no, I'm younger

184
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,290
and I can hold my own
and then we just decided

185
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,661
we would call him Bearded Rob
and then we've got Bald Rob.

186
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,563
So that's the
distinction that adhered,

187
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,697
we have between them.

188
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,633
But it's more than just what we

189
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,167
individually learned from him.

190
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,470
Going back to tool creation,
going back to contributions

191
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,672
to the community,
Rob wrote MacDaddy.

192
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,606
Do you remember MacDaddy?

193
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,108
- Yeah.

194
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,210
- Now MacDaddy was a tool
that kind of gave birth

195
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,680
to a lot of the functionality
that we have in the

196
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,651
sleuth kit and certainly
kind of birthed the concept

197
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,819
of timelining as we see
it today, how fundamental

198
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,289
is timelining to our
forensic analysis.

199
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,692
It's pretty critical and
that kind of stemmed from

200
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,061
that one, I have a need
to do this one function,

201
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,263
I'm gonna build a tool
and certainly that became

202
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,900
a common thing we now
use every single day.

203
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,401
The Sift Work Station.

204
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,203
Is there anybody in here who
doesn't have at least one

205
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:35,374
copy of Sift Work Station ready
to boot in Vmware right now?

206
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,276
Okay, Rob, we're
gonna talk later.

207
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,946
We're gonna fix that
back there because that's

208
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,447
an unacceptable answer.

209
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,115
That's a platform that, of
course, we can use to do

210
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,918
incredibly good forensic
analysis for free.

211
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,088
Bringing great knowledgeable
people like yourselves

212
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,190
to this trough of tools and
knowledge and capabilities

213
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,261
is something that
wouldn't be possible

214
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,563
if we all had to shell out to

215
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,766
even enter the field
to get these utilities.

216
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,235
Now there's a lot
of other things too,

217
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,503
but let's go beyond tools.

218
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,073
Every single one of you
is out there every day,

219
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,809
dealing with the most
complex, the most challenging,

220
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,712
the most important tasks,
in some cases, the nation

221
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,081
and I'm not being
facetious here,

222
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,415
but the world has to offer.

223
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,450
You're up against Nation
State adversaries.

224
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,354
You're up against some of the
most vile, terrible criminals

225
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,357
that need to be put
away for life times 10.

226
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,192
The fact that you're
doing the work,

227
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,793
that we're coming up with

228
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,562
good findings and
the methodologies

229
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,131
that we have, how are we
getting to those defensible,

230
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,134
solid methodologies is
absolutely critical.

231
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,369
Let's face it.

232
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,970
In the couple of minutes
that we've got here,

233
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,572
I could never sum
up the contributions

234
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:44,043
that you've made, but
Chad came pretty close.

235
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,113
Chad said, and again, I quote,

236
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:51,283
"Rob is the Richard Branson
of digital forensics."

237
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,620
(audience laughs and applauds)

238
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,489
Very, very well stated, Chad.

239
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,791
So you know, this is
all good and well,

240
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,826
but a lot of you may
not have the opportunity

241
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,795
to get a chance to know
Rob like a lot of us do

242
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,664
so I want to kind of
give a little bit of,

243
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,999
a little bit of perspective.

244
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,970
I've had the great, good
fortune to be a friend

245
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,372
an colleague of Rob's
for almost 20 years now.

246
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,942
You know, being able to
see him meet his very, very

247
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:21,414
patient and tolerable wife
Alissa, and their kids,

248
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,915
five years old, five-year-old
twins of all things,

249
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,651
Conner and Elliana.

250
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:30,522
Rob is like this quintessential
dad and I don't know

251
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,059
if you know this, and
I'm getting teary-eyed.

252
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,094
I told you we're gonna need
tissues, but Rob's like

253
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,264
this paramount of
dadship because you know,

254
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,999
you see what he
does with the kids.

255
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:44,070
He dresses up in group
costumes on Halloween.

256
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,939
That's pretty amazing
to be able to do that

257
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,809
and the enthusiasm he brings
to that is fantastic as well.

258
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,877
You know, he makes time
almost every single day

259
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,579
that he's in class, he was
running back at some point

260
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,382
no matter what timezone
he was in to Facetime back

261
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,383
with the kids or coming up
with new toys that he can use

262
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,720
to communicate with them via
voice and recording stuff

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,589
back and forth and like,
that's freakin' awesome.

264
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:07,093
Told you, I knew you
were gonna need tissues.

265
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,862
You thought I was joking.

266
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,865
(audience applauds)

267
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,805
Then, Rob crafted for
years, I don't even

268
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,774
wanna know what the timeline
for this looks like,

269
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,510
but crafted for years how
he was going to expose

270
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,545
his kids to Star Wars.

271
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,580
- Oh my god (laughs).

272
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,616
- Now, Rob I think you
disowned your neighbor

273
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,218
because they accidentally
spilled the beans

274
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,055
that you know, Darth was
Luke's father and you were

275
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,189
distraught for weeks
over this and I mean like

276
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,960
absolutely distraught,
but you know what,

277
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,896
I think there's more to
it because wait a minute,

278
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,498
you've got twin kids,
a boy and a girl,

279
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,669
there's kind of a Luke and
Leia thing going there.

280
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,540
But wait, that would make you...

281
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,676
Oh.

282
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,748
(Rob laughs)

283
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,518
And knowing what
you're capable of,

284
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,886
I'm not sure I want
you on the dark side

285
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,120
so I'm a little worried there.

286
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,588
Now this is a little bit of

287
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,089
a different thing
that I noticed.

288
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,591
I was looking for pictures
to put this thing together.

289
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,262
So in my photos application,
I just typed in the word vader

290
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,030
and look who pops up.

291
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,432
I didn't even make that up.

292
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,101
That absolutely happened.

293
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,537
So that brings me
to what Rob likes

294
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,273
about this whole
Star Wars thing.

295
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,210
Rob is, without a doubt, the
single person that I know

296
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,548
personally who is the
biggest Star Wars fan ever,

297
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,384
whether we're talking about
learning that Sarah Edwards

298
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,253
had never seen the movies
and before he could pick

299
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,423
his jaw up off the ground,
he had Amazon Primed

300
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,359
the Blurays to her
house overnight.

301
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,862
You will watch these,
this is homework.

302
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,897
Don't come back to
class until you're done.

303
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,767
Or whether it's in the
middle of class and Rogue One

304
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,602
comes out and Rob says
Midnight showing, we're going

305
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,438
and Rob runs back the next
morning more bright-eyed

306
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,707
and bushy-tailed than ever,
which is saying a lot.

307
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,843
You know that I'm
talking about this.

308
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,380
That is absolutely the kind of
enthusiasm that we have here.

309
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,250
You know, in fact,
I'm kind of wondering

310
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,052
why we went down
this naming path

311
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,287
because you know
the Sift utility.

312
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,624
Why is not the SANS
Investigative And Threat Hunting

313
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:23,629
toolkit because then it could
be the Sith Workstation.

314
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,298
We could make this happen, okay?

315
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,236
Next version, right?

316
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,672
Well, let me tie this
all together because it's

317
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,775
the 10th anniversary here and
what we kind of decided to do,

318
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:40,246
we wanted to recognize the
contributions you've made

319
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,781
to the community, we wanted
to recognize just the great

320
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,051
influence you had among
thousands and thousands

321
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,386
of people and we thought
what better time to do this

322
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,954
at the 10th anniversary.

323
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,223
Now this is not one of those
lifetime achievement awards

324
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,925
that you get at the Emmy's and
Grammy's and stuff like that

325
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,595
because we got a whole lot
more years needing your

326
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,198
guidance and help
throughout this, for sure,

327
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,468
but we wanted to come up
with something, we thought,

328
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,137
that recognized how much
we value working with you

329
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,472
as the years go on.

330
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,740
So.
- A Death star?

331
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,576
- We did not buy
you a death star.

332
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,445
That's for 20 years.

333
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,281
Don't you know the normal
gifts that we make?

334
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:19,450
So knowing that Rob's favorite
character is Darth Vader,

335
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,789
let me ask you a question.

336
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,557
Who played Darth Vader?

337
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,926
(man yells)

338
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,427
Ooh, James Earl Jones.

339
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,663
Very good guess, but not
the correct answer because

340
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,866
James Earl Jones was the voice.

341
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,702
Hold on, hang on,
give me a minute here.

342
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,938
But James Earl
Jones is very much

343
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,172
a part of the Vader character.

344
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,542
But as you said, David
Prowse is the person

345
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,678
who was actually in the
costume and the mannerisms,

346
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,048
the gape, the
clench of the fist,

347
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,350
that is just as much a
part of the character

348
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,919
even though you never,
in any of the movies,

349
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,655
see Dave Prowse's
face, even the part

350
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,357
when they took the mask
off was a different actor.

351
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,427
But that is somebody who is
just as much a part of Vader

352
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,529
even though you don't
necessarily see them,

353
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:06,498
you know, first hand, he
is absolutely a part of it.

354
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:10,002
So I've got this plaque
up here and I know

355
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,605
you all can't see it from back
there, but the plaque says

356
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,775
presented to Rob Lee, the
most lethal forensicator

357
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,946
we do know the power of
the DFIR side of the force.

358
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,686
But give me a minute right
here because blank plaques

359
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,722
are a little bit boring.

360
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:33,158
So we had to come up with
something appropriate

361
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,529
to put on this and you know,
I did quite a bit of research

362
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,633
and through a number of
inspired recommendations

363
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,435
from a few of the folks
on the advisory board,

364
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,204
we came up with something
that I think you're

365
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,974
absolutely going
to appreciate here.

366
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:53,145
Not only did we decide that
a Darth Vader helmet would be

367
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,283
appropriate, we also
decided that we're gonna get

368
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,958
this signed by Dave Prowse
so this is something

369
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,963
that you can display
proudly and it's something

370
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,031
that I'm really
excited to give to you.

371
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:17,202
Certificate of Authenticity,
the whole nine yards.

372
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,206
Rob, thank you for
everything that you do

373
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,507
and continue to do.

374
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,610
We're absolutely stoked
to have, you know,

375
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,544
a chance to participate
in the thing you built

376
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,815
and just be a part
of this whole thing.

377
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,053
(audience applauds)

378
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,630
So with that, now I'm
gonna make you talk.

379
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,068
- Wow.

380
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:53,739
I'm truly touched
and speechless.

381
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,642
Thank you, thank you everyone.

382
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,177
Every single year I come here,

383
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,711
this is the most exciting event.

384
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,914
I like the fact that it's small.

385
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,649
I like the groups
that come here.

386
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,820
Every time I teach people, it
makes the world a difference

387
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:11,690
to see how they progress
in their career,

388
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,592
where they've gone.

389
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,763
If someone is, you know, seeing
people move from countries

390
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,900
and getting recruited by Google
in onto their response team,

391
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,636
you know, because they
attended our classes and

392
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:28,540
been inspired to write tools
and it means the world to me.

393
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,610
Is Dave Holl in here by the way?

394
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,744
Is Dave still around?

395
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,279
I was gonna show you.

396
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,583
I almost guaranteed about
seven years ago, I think,

397
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,819
Phil pointed out to me that
the ringtone on Dave's phone

398
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:44,889
when I called it was my
laugh that he pulled down

399
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,195
from the mp3s so when
I call the phone,

400
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,998
you'd just hear this
hahahaha on his phone

401
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,502
and I'm still kind of
nervous with the fact that

402
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,072
somebody thought that
was a good idea, but.

403
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,908
I'm, I love this job.

404
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,214
I love the people I work with
and I love the community,

405
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,749
most of all.

406
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,686
Thank you everyone for doing
this and Phil and the team.

407
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,558
We're nothing without you guys.

408
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,128
It's about the team and
I appreciate it so much

409
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,862
of what you just did.

410
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,469
It means the world
to me, thank you.

411
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:34,206
(audience applauds)

412
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,208
(Darth Vader theme)

413
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,820
- Hey, closing out the
summit, it's always something

414
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,490
bittersweet to do,
but let's face it.

415
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,158
If we don't close out the 10th,

416
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,892
we can't get
started on the 11th.

417
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,162
I'm sorry, Jennifer, but we're
already thinking about it.

418
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,965
So suffice to say, I hope
you've had a fantastic couple

419
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,033
of days here.

420
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,236
You know, I've been
into it as I've said

421
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:06,672
and we look forward
to joining the class

422
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,674
if you're here for the
week or hanging out tonight

423
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,875
and coming back next year

424
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,143
if you're just here
for the summit.

425
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,545
Regardless, thanks very much.

426
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,217
- 10 years.

427
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,851
It's amazing.

428
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,589
We started back in Las
Vegas for a couple years

429
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,190
and we moved to DC.

430
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,694
We found our home in
Austin and even though

431
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:33,365
it's pretty much the
temperature of Mercury outside,

432
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,933
- Tatooine.

433
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,970
- Oh, it's the temperature
of Tatooine all the time.

434
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,172
It is the temperature
of Tatooine outside

435
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,707
every year that we come here.

436
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,109
No one really cares about
the temperature when you're

437
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,913
walking outside with your
friends and your peers.

438
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,582
Every single place that you
go, almost every single bar

439
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,585
on sixth street on both
nights, you could walk into

440
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,153
and you see family.

441
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:59,057
So looking forward to it next
year and for 10 more years

442
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,395
after this point so
thank you all for coming.

443
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,398
(audience applauds)

444
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,302
(suspenseful music)
