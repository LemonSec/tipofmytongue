1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,236
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,779
(applause)

3
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,516
- Okay, so, just, quickly.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,686
This is the ninth year of
the Forensic 4:cast Awards

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:24,691
so thank you everyone
that did vote.

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,360
For those of you
who didn't vote,

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,061
what's your problem?

8
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,697
(audience laughs)

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,499
For those of you who
don't know what this is,

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,870
Forensic 4:cast Awards were
set up several years ago,

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,305
mostly as a joke at the time.

12
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:44,944
And we set up, me and my
brother set this up, originally.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,980
We'd been to an awards
show and we sat there

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,349
and we thought, well, why
don't we have an awards

15
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,285
for people in our field?

16
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,587
So we set it up, we did
this silly online thing

17
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,926
and we had people
just e-mail us votes

18
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:03,830
for who they think should win
awards in certain categories

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,399
for Digital Forensics.

20
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,902
The response was
quite overwhelming

21
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,339
and so the next year,
Rob kindly invited me

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,477
to do the Forensic 4:cast Awards

23
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,913
at the Forensic Summit,
which was the last one

24
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,782
that was held in
Washington D.C.,

25
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,917
and we've done it as
part of the Summit

26
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,786
every single year since.

27
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,457
What makes this so unique

28
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,193
is that we have
these categories.

29
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:38,431
We ask the community, we ask
digital forensic investigators

30
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,167
who they'd like to nominate
in these categories

31
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,269
and there's no
interference whatsoever,

32
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,840
apart from people
who vote paperclip.

33
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,111
It happens.

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,847
No interference at all, the
top three from each category

35
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:56,683
goes into the voting portion
of this and, once again,

36
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,085
everyone gets to vote and
there's no interference

37
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,788
once again.

38
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,059
Whenever we hand out these
awards, they are specifically

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,929
for, I need to turn off
my engine, obviously.

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,265
They need to turn off...

41
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,033
Sorry.

42
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,036
(Lee laughs)
(audience member laughs)

43
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,573
I'm glad I don't get graded
on this particular one.

44
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,243
That's awesome.

45
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:29,182
It's the community which
says who wins the awards.

46
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,384
It's not

47
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,386
just some company
making decisions.

48
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,222
It's not some board or some
panel making these decisions.

49
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,492
It's you, it's all of you.

50
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,830
Every year or so we
have a particular theme

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,299
for the awards
and it's always...

52
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,335
I always try to do
something which is

53
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,337
relatively,

54
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,342
I don't know, something
to do with what happened

55
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,844
in the last year.

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,446
Now, if you look at what
happened in this last year,

57
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,816
I'm not going to do
a presentation based
on fidget spinners,

58
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,686
I'm not going to do a
presentation based on the dab.

59
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,856
So, what else is
popular this year?

60
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
Well, let's take a look.

61
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,762
(applause)

62
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,335
I figured that this
would, at least, keep,

63
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,340
I know Howell would be
interested if I did this.

64
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:34,180
We're going to start off with
Computer Software of the Year.

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,952
The three nominees
we have for this are

66
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,722

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,463
The winner for this category is

69
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:57,003
Magnet Forensics.
(applause and cheering)

70
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,353
- Thank you.

71
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,523
Wow, that's cute.
(applause)

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,031
- Given how many awards you're
actually up for you might

73
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,768
want to sit closer to
the front, just saying.

74
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,574
Okay, next category is
Forensic Blog of the Year.

75

Murphy's Laws of--
- physical forensics?

77
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,751
- It wouldn't fit all
on this line, sorry.

78
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,486
And then, This
Week in Forensics.

79
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,926
That was pretty weak, sorry.

80
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,829
And the winner for
this category is

81
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,531
Whoa!

82
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,235
(audience laughs)

83
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,338
I'm lost without the
Peli case, sorry.

84
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,575
The winner of this
award is Forensic Focus.

85
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,811
(applause)

86
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,517
You know what, we bribed
people to try and get them here

87
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:20,953
to pick up their awards
this year, still, nothing,

88
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,356
uncertain people.

89
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,894
We'll figure out a way
to get that to them.

90
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,532
I've already made my feelings
clear on this subject,

91
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,101
so, I'm not going
to rehash that.

92
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,706
Okay, next category is Phone

How you doing?

(Lee laughs)

101
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,145
- We're going after.

102
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,912
Okay.

(applause)

112
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,719
I hate carrying these things

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,223
back home.

Okay, I know there were
guidance people here.

Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

122
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,359
Someone is going
to be blacklisted

123
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,530

It saves me that picture
probably the first time.

131
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:10,823
Winner, Cellebrite.
(applause)

132
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,269
- Thanks again.

133
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,179

134
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,184
The next category is Open
Source Digital Forensic

135
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:40,953
Software of the Year.

136
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:44,489
This is actually, surprisingly,
quite a vicious fight

137
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,792
when you look at the voting.

138
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,595
It was up and down
very much the whole way

139
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,564
through the process.

140
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,200

00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,390
You know, we're kind of
batting at 50%, it's fine.

146
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,760
It's actually a lot better
than previous years.

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,564
(some audience members laugh)

148
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,631
Okay.

149
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,901
This one is vicious,

150
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,069
okay?
(audience member laughs)

151
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,140
I'm sure everyone
sees these emails

152
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,043
multiple times a week, like,
if you don't get an email

153
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,946
from Magnet Forensics or
Cellebrite about the Forensic

154
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:43,049
4:cast Awards they
don't know you exist,

155
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,285
okay?
(audience laughs)

156
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,822
In this category we have

157
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,627

(audience laughs)

162
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:20,419
I mean, Magnet Forensics.
(applause)

163
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,129

164
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,338
- Yeah, Price Waterhouse
Cooper have nothing to do

165
