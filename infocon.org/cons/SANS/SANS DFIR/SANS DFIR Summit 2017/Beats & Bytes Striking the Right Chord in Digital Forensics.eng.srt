1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,403
(digital music)

2
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,077
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,779
- So we want to
talk to you today

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,915
about a different kind of
computer and that's the one

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,052
that sits between your ears
because as you're doing

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,656
your forensic examinations,
I think everyone in this room

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:27,994
would agree that that is both
the most important computer

8
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:31,398
and the limiting factor
sometimes, right?

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,400
In keeping up with everything
we have to keep up with

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,670
and doing the work we do every
day, whether it's the hard

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,340
nature of what we're
dealing with content-wise,

12
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,477
or whether it's trying to jam
another fact into your brain

13
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,747
and then use it later,
this is hard work.

14
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:51,484
So we've been talking
about this for a long time.

15
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,319
Ryan and I met?
- 2012?

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,323
- In 2012 at some
forensics event.

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,727
(man mumbles)
We're debating which one.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,995
I was giving a keynote.

19
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,129
It was either Stranger
in a Strange Land

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,401
or it was about elephants,
but also about forensics.

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,902
- Yeah.
- And afterwards,

22
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,306
I came to talk to
his class of students

23
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,241
and I'll let you
take it from there.

24
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:19,245
- So I'm an adjunct professor
at Champlain College

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,482
in their digital forensics
science graduate program.

26
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,685
And at the DFRWOS meeting
in Monterey that year,

27
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,121
it was kind of the inner
residence where the students

28
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,390
got to come and do
their resident time
for their graduation

29
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,693
requirement, I was need
of a keynote speaker.

30
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,096
I didn't have one and
somebody said, "Hey, how about

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,197
"Cindy Murphy?"

32
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,199
And I had no idea who that is.

33
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,533
Uh oh.
- Oh, it's okay.

34
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,703
I jumped, sorry.
- Okay, and they said no,

35
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,604
she's great, she'd
love to do this.

36
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,905
Contact her.

37
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,373
I reached out to her,
she was very gracious,

38
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,309
she came to talk to the students
and we got in conversation

39
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:53,545
and long story short, we
found out we had a ton

40
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,014
of things in common.

41
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:59,818
Not only were we super
snappy dressers, but we also

42
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:03,556
(chuckles) were musicians,
and not only were we single,

43
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:06,326
excuse me, single instrument
musicians, but we were also

44
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,228
learning to play another
instrument that was not

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,931
our primary instrument,
which we thought

46
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,299
was very interesting.

47
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,135
And she shared and said,
"I think there are a lot

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,905
"of musicians among digital
forensic professionals."

49
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,440
oh, that's very interesting.

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,410
I had heard that as well
and it was just kind of

51
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,679
a topic of conversation,
we went our separate ways,

52
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,148
stayed friends.
- And you know the weirdest

53
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,516
thing we had in common?

54
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,284
We both played the banjo.
- Ah, the banjo.

55
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,319
Right.
- Yeah, it was pretty weird.

56
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,988
- The third individual that
you see up on the screen

57
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,391
is a guy by the
name of Matt Linton.

58
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,260
Does anybody know him?

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,494
(Audience member shouts)
Yeah, Matt's awesome.

60
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,496
So Matt used to be the
answer to response lead

61
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,766
at the NASA Center, where I
currently work in California.

62
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,635
He defected and went to Google.

63
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,936
Their gain, our loss.

64
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,373
But he and I are close friends.

65
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:54,908
He is also a musician.

66
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,011
He plays the fiddle, or
the violin, and the cello.

67
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,346
- And the ukulele.
- What's that?

68
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,015
- And the ukulele.
- And the ukulele.

69
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,918
And he and I started having
the same conversation.

70
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,923
He said, "There are a lot of
IR folks that play music."

71
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,759
Well, maybe this was
starting to be a thing

72
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,129
and so we kind of sparked up
this three way conversation

73
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:21,000
about whether or not this
was a thing, and if so, why?

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,937
So we kind of got the idea
for some original research,

75
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:28,308
a survey that we put
together that we sent out

76
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,243
to a particular sample.

77
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,613
It was a purpose of convenient
sample for those of you

78
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,449
statistic nerds out there.

79
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,120
We targeted Iasus and Sands,
and all kind of communities

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,591
that we thought might
have DFIR professionals.

81
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,125
- And one quick backstory.
- Yep.

82
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,128
- There's a person in this
room that also sort of

83
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,829
helped us along, too.

84
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,332
Frank McClain.
- Oh yeah.

85
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,900
- Wrote this great
blog piece on fiddling

86
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,537
and DFIR.
- Where is Frank?

87
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,771
- Frank is right there

88
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,039
in the middle.
- Ah, there he is.

89
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,107
- And so, that was also
an inspiration to us.

90
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,678
It was just another person
who had brought this up.

91
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:09,716
We know Mike Pore often would
come with his instruments.

92
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:14,687
Josh Wright also plays,
so all sorts of musicians.

93
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,456
So anyway, we put out

94
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,394
this survey.
- Anybody take it?

95
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,263
- Hands.
- Frank?

96
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,429
- Wow, it's so hard

97
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,431
to see out.
- Oh, there's that one

98
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,933
back there.
- Yeah, there's,

99
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,700
you know, 10 or 12 people.
- Okay, so we sent this out.

100
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,804
We actually got 206 responses,
which based on the size

101
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,407
of our field is a pretty
decent number, we thought.

102
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,743
And we started to break it down
from there and we found out

103
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,478
some really interesting things.

104
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,614
So the first thing, or
one of the first things

105
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:46,619
that we found was that among
the respondents, we found that

106
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:51,291
almost 50% reported that they
were musicians or regularly

107
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,194
played instruments of some
sort, which was kind of awesome.

108
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:58,031
We found that number to
be kind of remarkable,

109
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,566
but that really didn't
do us a ton of good

110
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,635
without some normative
data, trying to compare that

111
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,404
to the general public
because that's really what

112
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,374
we were talking about, is
is there really kind of

113
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,978
an increased instance of
musicianship, or playing

114
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,148
a musical instrument, or
singing because we included

115
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,584
singing, among
people in our fied.

116
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,620
As we did this other
research and tried to gather

117
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,491
these statistics, we found
that ranges were estimated

118
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,429
different surveys anywhere
from five or 6% up to the very

119
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,263
top end, closer to 34.

120
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,869
But as you know, if you've
ever tried to do research

121
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,672
about statistics, they can
be very dubious and they can

122
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,141
be made to say kind of
whatever you need them to say.

123
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,945
And so we spent
some time evaluating

124
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,348
kind of the provenance
of these statistics.

125
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
- [Cindy] But really,
what it came down to is

126
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,418
no matter what statistics
we looked at, whether they

127
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,755
were from the music industry
or whether they came

128
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,025
from the US Census, the
numbers we were getting

129
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,029
of DFIR professionals who
were musicians was close

130
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,899
to that 50% mark, where the
hightest, most skewed number

131
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,436
we could find for the general
population put it at around

132
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,607
38%, so there was definitely
something different

133
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,945
in this community, or at
least it appears that there

134
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,712
is a trend.
- So we wrote a paper

135
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,316
about this, it's in
the Sands reading room,

136
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,753
so all the good, raw data,
and all of the research

137
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,857
and backstopping and everything
related to the statistics

138
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:35,261
that we got from our survey
and why those things might be

139
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,163
is in the paper.

140
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,065
We encourage you to read
it, but one of the things

141
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,368
we definitely want to talk
about is what we came to figure

142
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:46,372
out was and acknowledge the
established link between science

143
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,308
and music.
- And there's a huge one.

144
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,413
So one of my great
heroes, Albert Einstein,

145
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,549
we all think of him as a
physicist and a philosopher,

146
00:06:56,549 --> 00:07:00,986
but he's also a major musician
and if you start doing

147
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:05,258
a little research out
there, he said on a number

148
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,094
of occasions that his
little theory, you know,

149
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:13,065
that theory of relativity,
was a discovery of musical

150
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,102
perception, something that
came to him through music

151
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,770
and that may sound fuzzy, right?

152
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,842
And it may sound really fuzzy,
but music is a language.

153
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,878
It's about patterns, it's
about putting down data points

154
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,049
in the right order in the
right pattern and creating

155
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,219
something in the end that
is a program our brains

156
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,719
understand as music.

157
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,156
So if you think about it in
those terms, it's a really

158
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,992
great analogy for computing.

159
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,662
- There was a very large
study that we cited

160
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,096
that,
- I'm waiting for

161
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,165
the first laugh.
(Ryan laughs)

162
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,001
- [Cindy] Does anybody
get the joke here?

163
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,436
Come on (laughs).

164
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,971
There aren't any musicians
in the room, maybe.

165
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,339
- No, music (mumbles).
- Yes (laughs).

166
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,775
- All right, our survey
was wrong, it's wrong.

167
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,611
(chuckles) one of the big
studies that was cited

168
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,881
was a group that
looked specifically at
what they considered

169
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,648
to be a high
performing scientist.

170
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:08,621
So these were Nobel laureates,
members of Sigma Chi

171
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:12,724
and some of these elite
scientific societies

172
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:17,196
and contrasted them with
just other scientists

173
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,898
in the general public.

174
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,901
They wanted to know what
made these people different

175
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:26,806
and as an aside to their
study, they noted that almost

176
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:30,510
universally, the scientists
that were most high performing

177
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,448
in their fields among which
Einstein would be one,

178
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:39,050
they had experience,
non-scientific

179
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,320
avocations or hobbies

180
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,324
that were rooted in music and
art and so they associated

181
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,829
these very closely and
covered a great deal of ground

182
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,733
in showing that not only
were these high performing

183
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,437
scientists also musicians
and artists, and that is

184
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,139
in part what's

185
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,676
seen to set them apart from
the other non-high performing

186
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,747
scientists, but that their
participation and success

187
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,150
and these non-scientific
hobbies were also not a function

188
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,218
of higher IQ, which we found
very, very interesting.

189
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,854
- Yes, I found that
actually really rewarding

190
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,422
because I've said many times

191
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,924
I might not be the smartest
person in the room,

192
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,492
but I'm really stubborn
and I'm really creative

193
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:24,864
and those things probably
make up for, and by the way,

194
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,366
I'm really, really
smart, so many rooms I,

195
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,769
but in many rooms I am
the smartest, but boy,

196
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,338
you get into a conference
like this and you start

197
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,573
to wonder, right?

198
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,043
We have that imposter
syndrome that sneaks in

199
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:41,747
for all of us, and this
was very comforting to all

200
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,214
of us.

201
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,784
Matt said, "Thank God," right?

202
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,353
Thank God that it's not
all about that IQ number,

203
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,589
that these high
performing scientists,

204
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,325
the highest
performing scientists.

205
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,095
Something about the
combination of creativity

206
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,966
expressed through music and
the science and technology

207
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,435
helped them to succeed.

208
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,569
- So creativity is a very
important word, specifically

209
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,074
scientific creativity
and perception, which
I know something

210
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,541
that's near and dear
- Yes.

211
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,210
- To your heart, how
we experience the world

212
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,913
not only as a function of
what we do as digital forensic

213
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:17,883
and IR professionals,
but also as musicians.

214
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,118
Will you elaborate on that?

215
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
- Absolutely.

216
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,922
So really, perception is
where it's all at, right?

217
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,525
So how we see the world
around us, we can't

218
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,830
look at any of those little
MAC times or the capitalized

219
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,065
MAC times unless we're able

220
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,005
to conceptualize what those
various timestamps mean to us,

221
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,073
what the pattern
underlying that mean

222
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,677
and unless we're able
to creatively parse out

223
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,313
the way Lee does, and
Heather does, and Sarah does,

224
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,283
and Nicole does, all of
those differences that might

225
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,752
be a possibility.

226
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,554
Unless we're able to
conceptualize the testing

227
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:58,891
that's going to lead
us to those answers.

228
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,828
- So several sociologists
and psychologists went so far

229
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,764
as to say that the best

230
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,402
scientific thinkers,

231
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,338
those individuals that were
most scientifically creative,

232
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,174
were also among the
best concrete thinkers

233
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,278
and they linked those two
skills very intimately.

234
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,814
So through the original research
that we did in the survey

235
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,217
and the backstopping we did
with the literature review,

236
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,487
we started to think
okay, so if we take

237
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,424
the fact that we think we
have a higher percentage

238
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,959
of musicians in these fields,
it's a very interesting

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,962
data point, but what use

240
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,100
could music be to us?

241
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,402
So let's say you're
not a musician.

242
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,438
Why do you care?

243
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,206
- [Cindy] How many people
in the room are not

244
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,607
musicians at all?

245
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,377
All right, there's
quite a few numbers.

246
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,911
- Guess what?
- That's okay.

247
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,680
- There's something you can
do to help your forensics.

248
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,316
Something fun, they call
it playing, in fact, right?

249
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,919
- Yes, it's really nice.
(Cindy laughs)

250
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,420
We enjoy it.

251
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,290
So the second half of the
paper, we shifted our focus

252
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,195
to the potential personal
and career benefits

253
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:12,832
of playing music for
DFIR professionals.

254
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,001
So this comes in
many different areas.

255
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,841
Principally, it comes in
areas related to stress relief

256
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,910
and just playing
and feeling better.

257
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,512
- Brain plasticity.
- Yes, comes in the area

258
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,281
of brain plasticity and
it can come in the area

259
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,016
of team building.
- Absolutely.

260
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,251
- So if you want to talk
about it personally?

261
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,553
- Sure, so actually,
I want to talk

262
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,188
about brain plasticity first
- Okay.

263
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,757
- Because it's on my mind,

264
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,224
right?
- Okay, cool.

265
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,861
- So brain plasticity,
basically, is our ability,

266
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,697
our brain's ability
to develop new

267
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,035
and unique neuron paths in
order to physically change

268
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,175
itself as we learn new
things and this can be active

269
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,609
your entire life.

270
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,014
So if you keep your brain
active, if you use it,

271
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,682
you won't lose it.

272
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,752
And there have been brain
studies that have shown

273
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:10,923
that people who practice
music into their elder years

274
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,995
actually suffer less from
dementia and can slow down

275
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,464
the process of dementia.

276
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,066
But once you have developed
your brain's ability

277
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,502
to create those new pathways,

278
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,738
it finds it easier.

279
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,274
It's like any other muscle.

280
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,577
Well, I don't really know
if it's a muscle (laughs),

281
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,479
but that again.
- Yeah.

282
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,014
- If you exercise
it, it will grow.

283
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:39,752
Musicians have more white
matter, more gray matter,

284
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,121
and more connections
between the different sides

285
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,891
of their brains, and that
helps us to learn more things.

286
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:50,596
Simply the act of listening
to music will stimulate that

287
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,565
and so one of the
questions we asked was

288
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,000
do you listen to music
during your exams and if so,

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,069
what kind of music
do you listen to?

290
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:01,339
We were looking for those
patterns and we found a great

291
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,576
deal of variety in
what people listened to

292
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,679
and we found some, a
surprising number to me,

293
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,314
because I listen to music
during exams, but we found

294
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,483
some who don't like to listen
to music because they find

295
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,885
it a distraction.

296
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,488
But it has been found that
the benefits of simply

297
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,694
listening to music are
there, but if you pick up

298
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,630
an instrument and start
to play around with it,

299
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,433
if you do those, if you
practice the motor skills

300
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:31,503
that help you to learn
to be a musician,

301
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,406
the benefits are
increased many times.

302
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,708
- Absolutely.

303
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,343
It really struck
a chord with me.

304
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,212
On my mom's side,
I have a really

305
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,547
excessive history of,
- It struck a chord?

306
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,815
(laughs) it struck a chord
- It did.

307
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,516
- With you.
- History of dementia.

308
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,551
I have a 92-year-old grandfather
who's deep in the throes

309
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,120
of it now.

310
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,891
My mom has started to show a
few signs, so that was kind of

311
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,492
important to me.

312
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,328
As we mentioned earlier,
one of the other areas

313
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,797
that can help us, beside
the brain plasticity,

314
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,233
because who among us wouldn't
want to grow our brain

315
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,902
and be better at what
we do professionally

316
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:08,040
by doing something fun, but it
can pay big dividends for us

317
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,043
as far as personally
enhancement, enjoyment,

318
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,444
and stress relief as well.

319
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,713
If you are a digital forensic
and incident response

320
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,283
professional, you're
in a stressful job.

321
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,119
Even if you like your
job, it's stressful.

322
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,321
For those like me
in law enforcement,

323
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,591
I mostly do intrusion compromise
stuff now, but I started

324
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
doing a lot of child
pornography, a lot of child

325
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,064
exploitation, a lot of sexual
assault, a lot of things

326
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,300
that were really tough.
- Shootings,

327
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,767
Stabbings.
- Absolutely.

328
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,003
- [Cindy] Yeah, people
hurting each other,

329
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,471
killing each other.

330
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,873
- There's some really
great quotes in the paper

331
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,876
from somebody who
described in great detail

332
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,812
what it's like to be a
digital forensic examiner

333
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,380
professional sometimes.

334
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,482
And IR professionals
don't have it much better.

335
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,452
They're dealing on a daily
basis with compromises,

336
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,022
intrusions that cost
their companies all kinds

337
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,426
of embarrassments and data
loss, and in some cases,

338
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,662
like the Sony hack, some
estimated that that cost

339
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,265
upwards of $2 billion with a B.

340
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,369
That's a lot of pressure,
so when we start looking

341
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,138
for things that deal with kind
of stuff so that we don't,

342
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,275
I don't know, get divorced
and push everybody we love

343
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,244
away from us, we start
looking for outlets

344
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,981
and there are plenty
of unhealthy ones.

345
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,750
You can drink and do drugs,
and go to fight club,

346
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,285
and you know, all
that fun stuff.

347
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,588
(Cindy laughs)
You know,

348
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,223
we happen to think, obviously,
because we found it,

349
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:34,293
but playing music
is a better choice.

350
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:38,297
There is a remarkable
program in Wisconsin where

351
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,800
Cindy lives, but do
you want to talk about

352
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,035
the pressure of that

353
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,370
since he is your neighbor?
- Yeah.

354
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,838
The Tires for Vets
were also warrior songs

355
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,906
that Jason Moon, my neighbor
right across the street.

356
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,744
I'm not sure what twist
of fate made that happen,

357
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,514
but he's heavily involved in
this program and basically,

358
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:59,118
the Department of Veterans
Affairs has staffed

359
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,053
and funded studies about

360
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,060
PTSD and music, and specifically
about teaching music

361
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,864
and learning music, and
how it can interrupt

362
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,535
a stress response, how
it can just cut it short

363
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,803
and sort of act

364
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,208
as a release valve for
pressure in the middle even

365
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:29,048
of a PTSD response and how
practicing music and learning

366
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,218
to play music can help veterans
to retrain their brains

367
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,923
to turn down that stress
response and to really

368
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:42,061
help them not only make
it through acute responses

369
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,330
to stress, but also
lessen the number

370
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,435
of those over time and
for some people, even find

371
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,503
lasting peace.

372
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,138
So it's a really great program.

373
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,639
- [Ryan] They did a great job.

374
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,709
I was in Kuwait and Iraq for
13 months and when I came back

375
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,245
is when I first started
being interested in music.

376
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,181
It did a world of good for me.

377
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,917
One of the last things
it can really do for us,

378
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,419
and we're talking about
career enhancement, is help us

379
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,689
build more effective teams.

380
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,360
And we're going to give you
a small demonstration of that

381
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,298
here at the end, but in
general, the team that plays

382
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,567
together stays together.

383
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,903
When you're in a situation
where you can participate

384
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,940
with people that you have to
deal with in a professional

385
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,142
situation, particularly if
that professional situation

386
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,411
is very stressful, having
an activity that you can do

387
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,247
that's very low
impact emotionally

388
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,885
that's very easy to
get into that provides

389
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,957
a lot of co-sharing of
the work and support,

390
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,161
it can have a tremendous effect
on how you work as a team.

391
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,431
If you're an IR team
or investigative team

392
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,733
and you're having to deal
with these types of things

393
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,869
on a daily basis in
your professional life.

394
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,937
- [Cindy] Sure, there have
been some really incredible

395
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,805
studies in this area too.

396
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,409
They've hooked up musicians
to brain monitoring equipment

397
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,946
and have found that
their brainwaves
actually sync together

398
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,750
as they're working through
songs and their breathing

399
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,053
and their heart rates
all come together

400
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,858
and so if you're talking
about good, solid, nonverbal

401
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,461
communication, you're
not going to find it

402
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,998
much more quality than
you get playing music

403
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,332
with a group of people.

404
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,768
There's a wonderful
quote in the paper

405
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,872
that I should have included
here, but it talks about

406
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:38,577
how music is the one time
you can lose the pitiful me

407
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,347
and really become part
of a group and experience

408
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,685
what it means to work with
other people in a team

409
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,656
and lose that worry about
making mistakes, right?

410
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,392
Because if I hit the wrong
chord, I bet Daniel over here

411
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,996
has got the right one and
his solid chord covers mine

412
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,532
just fine and it might even
sound like I was intentionally

413
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,936
doing some sort of
strange harmony there,

414
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,940
so a lot of the mistakes
musicians feel themselves make

415
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,609
actually contribute to the whole

416
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,846
of the music that
they're playing.

417
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,417
- [Ryan] You've been
listening to us say this now.

418
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,685
It sounds like we're

419
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,485
in a cult, right?
- Right (laughs)?

420
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,553
- [Ryan] A religion.

421
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,955
Testify!

422
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,225
- Yeah, that's right.
- You know, you can be

423
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,261
musicians too, but
you know, it really is

424
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,296
one of those things that
we just kind of discovered.

425
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:32,497
I mean, it was an
evolution for me.

426
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,432
- Well.
- I didn't wake up one day,

427
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,433
I'm going to be a musician.

428
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:35,734
This is awesome!
- To be fair,

429
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,835
to be fair, Google
knows about this,

430
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,303
right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

431
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,872
- [Cindy] They have invested
in an entire building

432
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:45,043
full of practice rooms for
their employees and so lucky.

433
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,679
- [Ryan] And so when
we say entire building,

434
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,416
it's not like a gardener's shed.

435
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,653
It is a full-size office
building and when we say

436
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:57,623
that it is stocked with
instruments, it is stocked

437
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,157
with instruments.

438
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,928
You go into every room, every
room, and there are stringed

439
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,097
instruments hanging on the wall.

440
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,767
There has got to be 30 freaking
drum sets in this thing

441
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,271
and just every room
is for employees to go

442
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,007
and take instruments,
and play, and de-stress

443
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,143
and do the things they need
to do to be happier at work.

444
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,811
Right, we all know
that Google is into

445
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,780
keeping their
employees happy, right?

446
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,216
They get free food and
slides from the third floor

447
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,150
down to the lobby and all
that kind of fun stuff.

448
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:30,155
Well, they also have the
opportunity to make music.

449
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,490
And Matt and I play regularly.

450
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,125
We try at least every two weeks.

451
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,960
No matter what we
have going on at work.

452
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,130
I'm at Aims Research Center
in Mountain View, California,

453
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,365
so we're right up
against Google.

454
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,933
We share a fence.

455
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,268
So Matt and I are still close.

456
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,770
- Yeah, and you
know an interesting,

457
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,905
Matt, and interestingly,
Matt has told stories

458
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,407
where he will say to
people, "No, I'm sorry,

459
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,074
"I can't attend that meeting."

460
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,711
This is my scheduled
practice time during work.

461
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,882
So they really do, they've
invested in their employees'

462
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,485
musical brains to that level.

463
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,889
So there really is
something to it and it helps

464
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,458
on all sorts of levels.

465
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,293
- [Ryan] So we definitely
want to share two more things

466
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,928
before we get into the
little bit at the end here.

467
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,030
- [Cindy] Well first, I've
been putting quotes up

468
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,932
and you probably noticed
that some of them

469
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,335
are from musicians and some
of them are from scientists,

470
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,439
a lot of theoretical
physicists, but I love

471
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,873
this quote from
Jessie Cornblume.

472
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,275
Anybody know Jessie?

473
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,043
You should, right?

474
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,379
You use his tools, I'm sure.

475
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,749
And he used to be a Sands
instructor, so Jessie

476
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:34,219
the other day on Facebook
quotes, throws this quote up

477
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,389
and says, "Conventional wisdom,
you shouldn't send an email

478
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,990
"when you're emotional or upset.

479
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,926
"Less well known or equally
valid that you should

480
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,462
"also hold off when you're
listening to Poison."

481
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,932
He was listening to Talk
Dirty to Me and sent an email.

482
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,101
And regretted it (laughs).

483
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,904
So this is real and
it affects all of us.

484
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,941
It's a question of whether
you notice it or not.

485
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,477
- [Ryan] So in our survey,
we also, in addition to

486
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,979
trying to get kind of the
vocational demographic data down

487
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:05,951
and learn about how people
in our field play or not,

488
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,886
we also asked them
open-ended questions

489
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,056
about do you listen to
music when you do exams?

490
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,060
Do you think music has an
affect on the way you do

491
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,227
your job?

492
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,196
What do you listen to?

493
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,865
Things of that type.

494
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,401
So one of my favorite
answers to the question about

495
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,571
how do you think music affects
the way you do your job?

496
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:30,475
Well, somebody said doing
digital forensics is like

497
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:34,012
putting together a
really good performance.

498
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,982
It's like putting together
a really good song.

499
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,751
I have to be creative, I have
to follow where things lead,

500
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,555
I have to be solid, and
people have to understand it.

501
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:47,192
A good forensic report is like
a good musical performance.

502
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,661
When you deliver it and you're
done, you want the audience

503
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,264
to flick their Bick
lighters up in the air

504
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,298
and wave them back and forth.

505
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,634
(Cindy laughs)
I loved that,

506
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,068
that was one of my
favorite quotes.

507
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,637
- Yeah.
- One of the other things

508
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:02,174
that we asked participants to
do is if they listen to music

509
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,243
while they do their exams,
give us their top five.

510
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,679
We want to know what
their type five songs were

511
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,516
that they listened to
when they do their jobs.

512
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,185
- [Cindy] And we're
giving that back to you

513
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,220
- That's right.
- As an extra bonus.

514
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,190
- So we put together
at the end of the paper

515
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,059
in one of the appendices,
is we made a list

516
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,930
of the artists and song
names of all the songs

517
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,531
that all the
respondents gave us.

518
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,999
- It's weird,
- Yeah.

519
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,203
- It's very weird (laughs).
- It's really eclectic.

520
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,506
I think we went up to
about 173 songs and we have

521
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,708
a little addendum of
like, 45 more where people

522
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,477
didn't say a song.

523
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,712
They said like, "Anything
by Zach Brown band,"

524
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,214
or whatever it is
they listened to.

525
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,783
And one Barney the Dinosaur
song made it on there.

526
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,253
- Yeah.
- A couple of things

527
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,388
by Weird Al.
- There's always

528
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:54,826
a smarty pants out there.
- Tie Me Kangaroo, Down Sport.

529
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,861
(Cindy laughs)
Where is the Aussie

530
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,128
that was up here earlier?

531
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,664
Yeah, we got Tie Me
Kangaroo, Down Sport

532
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,734
made it on there, so it's
in the paper, but we also

533
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,971
created a Spotify
playlist that's public,

534
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,807
so if you want to go
listen to this, it's called

535
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,576
The Ultimate DFIR Playlist.
- Yep.

536
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,479
- You can find it on Spotify
and you can listen to it

537
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,082
to your heart's content.

538
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,618
- Absolutely.
- And we stay on the topic?

539
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,153
- Well I mean, so much to say.
- Oh yeah.

540
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:26,057
- [Cindy] We did a one hour
webinar and we also did

541
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,227
the forensic lunch,
which was another hour,

542
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:31,796
or at least most of an
hour in preview for this

543
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,933
half hour talk, so there's
a lot of information

544
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,702
that we've already put out
and we thought that we would

545
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,106
take this opportunity to
share with you kind of

546
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:45,176
in a different way, realizing
that this is, in a lot of

547
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,480
ways, outside of everybody's
comfort zone a little bit,

548
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,183
but I think Lee Whitfield
a couple of years ago

549
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:55,854
did a talk about forensics
and mental health

550
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,357
and how we can support ourselves
and we wanted to follow up

551
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,961
on that with the research
that we had come up with

552
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,795
as well.

553
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,267
So we're hoping that you enjoyed
this and then we're going

554
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,638
to go way out of
our comfort zone

555
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,341
and do some music for you.

556
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:21,079
And before we do that, I'm
going to get to the slide

557
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,649
where we have the chorus
because we're hoping.

558
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,751
I know, it's like church, right?

559
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,653
We're hoping.

560
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,922
I don't go to church, by
the way, but (laughs).

561
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,459
We're hoping that you'll
maybe get inspired to join us

562
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,962
if you feel so inclined
and Frank, you got those

563
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,830
bones out?
- All right, so we're going

564
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,532
to buy Frank out.
- And does anybody

565
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:42,067
play the ukulele?
- And Ishmael,

566
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,769
where did he go?
- I'm serious.

567
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,438
Anybody play the uke?

568
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,974
It's such a common instrument.
- Where did he go?

569
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,841
He brought his guitar with him.

570
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:54,279
