1
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:19,579
So Anyway i'm ryan benson and i'm gonna be talking about deciphering Browser Hieroglyphics so That's quite a Mouthful but What does that Actually Mean

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:28,009
So the first Thing is this deciphering not decrypting so encryption Generally Implies That you're trying to keep some data secret right

3
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,240
And

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,989
In Forensics we are running into Encryption more and more as People and applications want to do things to keep Their private data

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,489
you Know private

6
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,689
But Just Because You see something and you can't immediately Understand It Doesn't Mean That you're not meant to understand so the story of how

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,638
European's Went about eventually deciphering The ancient egyPtian Hieroglyphs is Pretty interesting and i'm gonna be Kind of Referencing It Kind of Throughout My presentation

8
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,239
But Basically They're Trying to it for a Few Hundred Years

9
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,789
And They've had all these problems Making sense of it Just Because It was so fundamentally different Than Any language They were familiar with

10
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,169
But That Wasn't Because the Egyptians were trying to make It hard for them they Just the europeans didn't

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,450
Have the quite frame of reference in order to make sense of it

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,519
So That'S deciphering in Hieroglyphics and so The Middle part is browser

13
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,199
so that Seems Kind Of a Straightforward but i mean What's What's a Browser nowadays

14
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,240
There's Lots of video Games That Have web Browsers built into them there's Very popular desktop applications That Are Actually Just Bundled web Browsers

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,820
And Lots of mobile Apps Use web technologies in the backend to power them so you're gonna find browser

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,600
Artifacts in Way more Places Than Just did like The Name-Brand web Browsers

17
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,930
and so again While this Says browser

18
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,120
All the specific Examples i'M going to show in the presentation are from Chrome Just Because chrome is Kind of What i do

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,249
But All The Apps that Generate these artifacts all Work across Browsers so you'll see these same?

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,708
Artifacts in all The Other Kind of Browsers Histories

21
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,639
and While Sincerely hope that these artifacts i'm going to show you specific artifacts will Help You in some Investigation i

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,620
Think What's gonna be longer lived and Actually more Valuable to you is Kind of the process of how to decipher

23
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,690
different Things and Kind of The Tools

24
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,770
So with that i'm gonna try and use a different Kind of Tool for Every artifact i'm going

25
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,359
To show You it's my hope is that You'll be best armed like The wider array of Tools Because like

26
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,679
Certain Things were Better for Certain People and There's Like Always more Than One Way to approach a problem

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,760
So i want to give You a Bigger Arsenal When you're trying to decipher stuff like on your own

28
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,940
so this is the Wonderful

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,290
Long-Lost ancient Land Of Chroma topia i Guess or whatever we gonna Call it

30
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,930
so basically The way you want i want you to read this Map is there's these Little Buildings and Each Little Clusters of Buildings Is

31
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,770
Like an artifact

32
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,340
So you see like the history data or history there's cookies?

33
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,928
different caches and They're Kind of Clustered By The Kind of Underlying

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,349
Storage i guess so the Kind of artifact so basically closer something is together

35
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,069
Like The more Similar They Kind of are so in the top left we have

36
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,019
Like The History database and the cookies database these are like the the

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,109
web Browser artifact 101 Kind of Things you look at Their Sequel id databases They did Very well Explore we Kind of Know how to

38
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:08,990
Make sense of them in the bottom There's these different Kinds of Caches Chrome Has a Whole Bunch Of different cache files

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,980
Or different different Places Where they cache Things and They'll Be Very Similar structure but

40
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,100
There's Like Index Block and There's a data Block Files and reason native Files

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,959
So basically They're all Similar and then in the Middle there we Kind of have like The Bookmarks and the preferences and some other Things?

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,790
That are Json files so you again these are nice easy to read Kind of Human readable Files

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,469
So we can Kind of Label These like regions on the map i guess it's the Kind of the technologies that They Run them

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,980
But if you look Inside the chrome like profile folder where all this Stuff Is there there's Way more Files Than This like there are

45
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,109
Dozens and Dozens and Dozens of more Files Than Just These

46
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,730
The Most internet History Investigations Kind of Focused Just on these Ones That were really Familiar With

47
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,040
But There's all These Other Kind of Buildings Out There these other artifacts

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,950
And so we're gonna Kind of Explore like What else is out there

49
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,480
So switching back to the ancient Egyptians

50
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:06,170
Uh so Europeans have been in contact With Egypt for a Few Hundred Years Mostly Flick Merchants Landing in Northern Egypt or Whatnot

51
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,339
But The Actual eventual deciphering of Hieroglyphs Only Really Was Kick-started by Napoleon so no pulling this Kind of

52
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,530
Doing This Thing in Europe and he had but he had missions of Having a Grand empire like Alexander The Great

53
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,929
And Part of That Is he wanted to control india and

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:27,919
In his grand Plan His stepping-stone to get today control of India Was to go in was to go take Over Egypt so in 79

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,030
He launched an Expedition

56
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,580
And Just Invaded EgyPt so he landed in northern Egypt because we're like Their most Familiar

57
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,860
So That's Kind of Analogous with The left side of our Map Here so it's the kind of Stuff They had some idea Was going

58
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,610
on
But

59
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,789
No one know what no westerners Really went outside of That Northern Egypt because there's Really Not welcome is Pretty Dangerous so it's basically like

60
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,890
UnexPlored Territory

61
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,070
And so napoleon Didn't Just want to like conquer bunch of Places he wanted to actually build the empire and so part of an empire

62
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,360
Is having all the technology and the culture and all the different like showing Your engineering Marvel or Whatnot?

63
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,339
So he didn't Just Bring soldiers with his invasion he actually Brought some of The top engineers

64
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,830
And Scientists and Scholars From France With Him and he Actually detached them to his armies

65
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,640
and so When he Landed the locals were you know

66
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,609
Obviously Not Very happy with being Invaded so they're fighting back and there's These native troops Called Mameluke S--

67
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,209
and They were very happy to Attack his armies and Run away in the desert and then

68
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,620
He would chase them and lots of The solders Would die in the desert Because They're not used to Dealing with the desert

69
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,289
And so the Mammals were quite happy this tactics that Kept dragging you on he split up his armies and They're chasing Him oliver Oliver?

70
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,710
This Unexplored regions of Egypt

71
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,440
and so these Scholars are Going Along with them and

72
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,219
They're Just fascinated By all these ain't these all These ancient Ruins They've never seen Before

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,950
But They're Moving so quickly chasing these Other soldiers that They can't really do in-Depth Investigations They're Just

74
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,700
Rapidly Trying to Sketch Out the ruins or take Rubbings of Hieroglyphs

75
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,630
so they're Kind of Collecting data Routers Rather Than trying to like interpret Things

76
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,270
and so all this data They collected i Ended Up being Very Helpful for other People that eventually

77
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,970
Figured Out How to decipher the higher voice

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,580
Sounds all a Pretty long Little History Lesson They're Basically to tell you that like we're gonna do the same Thing in the crone folder

79
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,308
So i'm gonna pop in there and Just go do a quick Lightning Survey and

80
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,040
That's Kind of Where these Other Names Popped up on the map

81
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,220
So these are Things that We like we don't really Know What They are

82
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,200
But i can tell you like i know the Names are because like in chrome like You name the name of the directory the name?

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,590
Of The artifact so you know

84
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,200
There's some Stuff Here so we do have some things that we can Go back to later Try to decipher and make more sense though

85
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,149
So we're hanging Out over here Kind of Been in the sequel light Land That's Kind of Our home bases because we're Their most Familiar

86
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,739
Those Kind of Things But we're going to start Let's start deciphering something Like Maybe a Little Bit closer to home

87
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,909
so local storage Anybody Familiar With local storage

88
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:51,407
It's basically Like The htMl5 version of Cookies right so it's uh

89
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,588
It has a greater Capacity Than Than older cookies but it's basically The same idea you had like a some Keys and you

90
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,589
Have some Values that you can store

91
00:07:00,749 --> 00:07:04,699
So this is an Example of The Way It Works is you have a sequel i'd database?

92
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,568
For Each Website That you have so this is for pinterest There's a so it's?

93
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,169
with the name of the website and then dot Local storage but it's actually sequel i'd database

94
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,419
and Inside here you can see the Kind of data so it's Kind of Similar to the older cookies right There's like a Like a

95
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,549
Boolean value There's some integers

96
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,299
There's like a Json and There's some interesting Stuff in there

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,818
X looks Like There's a Timestamp There's a Path to some page you might have looked at so There's interesting Stuff there nothing Groundbreaking But?

98
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:34,278
It might Be Useful your case so i definitely suggest you Looking in local storage When you're Kind of As a Part of Your Investigations

99
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,119
This is another site so this Is a News site

100
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,679
This is getting a Little more interesting We Got Some making to figure out What Kind of computer They were using

101
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,859
Maybe some geolocation Information They might Be relevant to your case if it's about device that moved Around a Lot Again more Timestamps

102
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,209
So Weird There's some Pretty Good Stuff in local storage but It all makes sense so far and

103
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,490
Then and then We Get to this like

104
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,088
How do you make of This so this is this is slack

105
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:08,718
and i really Doubt This is meant to be read literally right i Mean There's a Bunch of asian Characters in There

106
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,648
There's Like Mixed Where there's a Pair of Scissors There's a Bunch of unprintable Characters

107
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,149
and i actually Found

108
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:15,779
Literal

109
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,729
EgyPtian Hieroglyphs in this

110
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,579
Right Cuz it's a and so That's Kind of Talk name of This talking from is because Actually Found Hieroglyphs in my browser History Which

111
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Was Definitely a First for me

112
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:30,199
And This isn't the only data key or the only Thing in local storage There's all these different Keys This one is the members data?

113
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,199
But There's There Was about 20 more

114
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,399
Keys in Here

115
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,329
switching back to egypt so there's Much of soldiers That were Kind of Forward Fighting

116
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,839
We're doing some fortifications Around a Fort outside the City of Roseto

117
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,169
They found This 1700 pound rock with a bunch of Stuff Written on it

118
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,930
But The scholars went went ecstatic Because it had the same Thing but They Suspected with the same Thing Written on it in three different

119
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,189
Languages The top one is Hieroglyphs the Middle One Was an older script Called Demotic and

120
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,780
Bottom-1 was ancient Greek and they Knew how to read ancient Greeks so they thought This is the key to everything

121
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:06,229
It Was a Little compe Than that but It was but the rosetta stone did end up being Pretty important for deciphering Hieroglyphs

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,540
So i kind of Wanted My owners that It stone right That Sounds like a Useful Thing i'll take a Little Crib Sheet it tells

123
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,998
Me how to translate things and so i went and Actually

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,850
Found one

125
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,929
so if you Guys use slack Slack is you can Get to it on the

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,510
WeB interface or you can Get to it in a desktop application

127
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,930
And so slack is Actually Built using the electronic framework The Electron the framework is basically a Bundle to chromium browser

128
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,999
so if you look at the data behind slack on the desktop It looks a Lot Like Chrome so it's like alright Cool like i

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Know how to read this

130
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,650
And i looked and i pulled mine open and i found the same

131
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,670
Data Keys Like Members Doubt and Whatnot

132
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,520
But for the Actual data it Was a Nice easy to read Json like alright This is this is how it's supposed to be like

133
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,059
I can Read this and There's Actually some Pretty Good information in there

134
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,809
Like The Example i have Here is members data there Was another key Called

135
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,020
Channel Messages Which is like all the Chat Messages like You'd Expect

136
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,290
Unfortunately That One has Gone Away in a Few last Few months Because an older Version it's like You still might Find that one

137
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,810
So i kind of had like Aren't This What it's Supposed

138
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,969
To look like and this is What It looks like on the internet

139
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,429
And Then There's a One Other key that Was in there that wasn't you know i mean These Mangled Glyphs It Was called

140
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,120
Is compressed so

141
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
The Desktop

142
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,099
Is compressed was no the website is compressed was yeah so mike aria This is this is called a clue this is obvious some kind

143
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
Of some Kind of compressed dad all Right

144
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,820
But What Kind of compression is this i've Never Seen anything Looks like This before i ran It for all the normal

145
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,890
Decryption or decrypt decompression Things

146
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:35,030
and nothing Really Works and so i turned to something that you know the the your french Europeans didn't Really Have you know Google

147
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,130
and so i started Looking Around like alright so

148
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,669
Wells can i find here and i started Looking and i found i started eventually Searching for local storage specific Compression Things

149
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,529
and so local storage is Really Generous you Get about five meg's of space

150
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,790
Versus htTP cookies Which is 4K so it's a lot but i found a Lot of People were pretty

151
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,380
Disappointed with That They wanted a more storage and so There's Actually a Lot of Ways to compress data in local storage

152
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,729
And That Led me actually to this guy so Lz string

153
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,080
so basically if you

154
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,969
Javascript Stores Things in the local storage in UtF-16 ish

155
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,718
Way so basically That means iF you're storing a Ski type data

156
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,749
Every Other Byte is gonna be a null and so you're effectively Losing Half Your storage space and so This guy Didn't like That

157
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,130
so what It Does is It compresses your data and It Stores It in

158
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,999
UtF-16 code points like and hi-hi code point so you're using both the bytes

159
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,650
and That Was how you could Get more data in there

160
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,608
But The fun part is is like This is never meant to be read literally so they don't

161
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,159
Have to be like a Sign Code points They're Actually Valid code points

162
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,819
so that made like Making sense of It Really fun

163
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,669
If you've ever done Any Work with python and unicode i've

164
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,570
Unleashed more Than my Fair share of Curses trying to Get stuff to work and having the

165
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,689
Non-Working Unicode Points did Not Help me us anyway i'm gonna show you how to do this Without using any programming

166
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:01,640
so there's a awesome tool Called Cyber Show so this is put out open source by gchq and basically It Consists of a Lot of

167
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:08,330
operate Like common operations That are Very Simple Things and then You can stitch them together to make It more complex like so

168
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,780
Complex operation

169
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,659
And You there's nothing in Here that you can't do in the command line or a Hundred Other Ways but it's Very easy it's drag

170
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,350
and Drop and it's really Cool

171
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,040
So at a past Jog we had an internal Tool

172
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,170
That Would Magically convert One Thing to another and was Pretty Similar in concept to this It Was Really Helpful for Just

173
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
Exploring Things Really Quickly returning to

174
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,049
DecryPt Some Kind of you Know there's Lots of did operations in Like Bower Analysis Basically It's really neat Tool to have and

175
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
This One's a Really Slick open-source Version

176
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,030
ok Good looks Better

177
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,400
ok
So on the on the far left we have the?

178
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:45,439
Operation so this is all the different Things that You can Cyber Chef can Do they look at the components of your recipe

179
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,719
and You can Search in the top bar That's good Because There's there's Hundreds of different Things you can Do Which Makes It Really powerful

180
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,409
In the Middle there's the recipe is That'S where you can Drag these little Cells Over?

181
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,020
And Reorder Them and then You Kind of Make Build This Whole Thing and you can Save recipes and Load Recipes Later so once you

182
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,468
figure Out how to decode something you can Easily reuse it or share it with somebody Else

183
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,579
And on the far right We Have the input and the output so basically the input is Just your input and then the output

184
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,439
Takes The input Runs the recipe on it and puts it back in the outfit so it's Kind of like a live Thing you can

185
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,559
Kind of See What's happening so let's Let's Get started With

186
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
With our Slack

187
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,850
So the first Thing?

188
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,930
That We Need to do is Get The raw data

189
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:32,159
This is another open-source Tool open source Equal light Browser and i went open my Slack database my local storage database

190
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,030
went to that members Key

191
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,970
You Need to make One change the table has Changed them both from text to Binary Because you want the Actual Binary Information

192
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,930
Just Click in there

193
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,930
Ctrl a Ctrl C

194
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,728
Go over to the input and Just paste it in the top right and so the input and output look exactly

195
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,970
Identical Right Cuz there's nothing The recipe so there's no Transformation going on

196
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,909
But One of the first Things you want to do is like okay so this is Kind of in the output from like a Hex

197
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,399
Editor Kind of Thing Where there's all these new lines That are predictable length

198
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,489
and There's a Dozen Ways you can Rid above me and copy/paste out to notepad plus plus and remove Stuff Bill any Hey let's Let's

199
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,979
See if cyberstep can Make This you know save us a Few Seconds

200
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,789
So i'm gonna start typing on the on the right side there for

201
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,310
operations for Line and

202
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,810
There's Thing in there Called Remove whitespace I'M Just gonna Go ahead and Drag That Over and drop it

203
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,229
Sorry For My Stop-Motion animation it's i think It Works so basically at The bottom You'll see then the output now That's there's no

204
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,039
No, no White space alright so That's pretty Simple but That's a Nice. Oh?

205
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,849
The Next Thing from Exploring This i i

206
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:38,009
Understand That i need to swap the Byte order of These Things right so the first it so it's 8 - 3

207
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,810
7 it looks like in the input Values and i want to swap that so it's 3 7 8 to this key That's?

208
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,290
You're Familiar That's Called The endianness of the data so you want to swap Every other Byte

209
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,990
So i was going to start Searching for end i'm gonna find

210
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:55,139
Swap Indian asst Drag It Over there alright Bam i got except That's not quite right so

211
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:01,080
It Looks Like i Wanted 3 7 8 - i have 20 b6o so ok so you look at swap and enos

212
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,550
Its length of 4 i want to swap Every other Byte so Just That's cool Just change It down - to

213
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:09,180
Do that and Now you have Exactly What you wanted alright so you may Play to That

214
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,790
The Next Thing is i have all These nice hex Bikes but i want to get my my ugly Little Glyph Things

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,750
So i'll do my text encoding so start Searching for Text

216
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,718
You can Change different options the input is hex the output is utF-16 and then Now i have Now i have my glyphs Right That

217
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,149
I can use as my basis start decoding we're decompressing

218
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,420
AnyBody's more Familiar This Kind of Stuff i could Have Combined those last Two Steps right i don't they don't Need to swap the in

219
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,659
Tunis i could Have Just Picked Code utF-16

220
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,319
le

221
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,390
so you can Swap in Italy impression the swapping Inside there but This is Just Kind of show you

222
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,630
Okay there's Always more Than One Way to do something

223
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,190
And Then the last Thing so i have my dad and now in the format that i want now i want to decompress it

224
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,468
So start Typing 4lz string so this Actually Isn't One That's in the gchq

225
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,249
Cyber Chef I had to build This one and so i forked This on my github

226
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,750
Ivan All That Got Pushed yet but it'll be Up there Shortly so if Actually use elzey string That's the only difference

227
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,710
Then Now we have a Nice Json there right so we went from this

228
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,919
Blob of Blob of digits down down to like a Cool Json right so That's Pretty slick you can Say This recipe you can Load

229
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
It Later You Pass it off to your friend

230
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,570
It Looks Like This Pretty interesting Stuff in there right so there's a

231
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,969
There's some urls Looks Like There's some Ids there's some Names or email Addresses

232
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,468
And so you can Start Doing some Regex or whatever but i mean all right we're already Here maybe i can Go farther?

233
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:37,130
So there's This Whole Section of Extractors Inside cyberships so it's basically common Things that You want to search for

234
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,520
and so there's tons of them But Let's Just Say it's Just like email Addresses so

235
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:46,160
I'll Just Drop that in there and then Bam There's my email Addresses for My Selection Like so That's

236
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,260
That's Pretty Simple But You Just then you can Just

237
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,680
Just Basically Showing How quickly can Go for one Things you know there and there was no

238
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,339
No code typing at all Involved in this so That's Just Just Kind of an Example

239
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,120
so now we Finished our first Decryption or

240
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,520
deciphering oh Stop Saying That

241
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,560
we're gonna Kind of Head Over to this Kind of more Unexplored region Like we Kind of This Survey of This we Know if these

242
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,220
artifact Names are

243
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,199
From Our Little quick Survey we can tell That There's a Lot of Similar Similarities in structure

244
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,898
But we don't Really Know What this is exactly

245
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,908
So let's Just open Up one of them at Random and see like What it looks like

246
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:27,379
So this is inside this happens to be a cesta Session storage folder and so There's a Bunch of files That are dot l Db

247
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,928
in other Ones There's some Ss t

248
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,319
There's a Log file and Then There's This Lock current management all This Kind of Stuff and if You open Up those l dB Files

249
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,109
There's some Stuff That Looks Like Human readable Text but it's Kind of Mangled a Bit so it's not quite What you'd want to actually

250
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,110
Make sense of

251
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,679
But This is the structure it's repeated in all These Kind of artifacts and so i hadn't Seen this before

252
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,399
i didn't Know what it was but Then again

253
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,299
Again I'm Lucky They look here Than The Europeans like i Just Googled it

254
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,978
And Also Helpful Because This is part of Chrome so the Chromium source is it's open-source

255
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,030
Products so i can Go look at the source code and figure out that this is something Called Leveldb

256
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,250
So leveldb Is a is billed as a Fast key value storage From Google so basically What it Does is it a

257
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:16,639
It's has a Very Limited Number of Operation so you can Basically Get Put and delete and There's Like Both versions of all Those

258
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
but It Does It Really fast

259
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:24,260
So it has like less Features in This Equal light but it's like Way faster Than that and so it's Basically Google Built it further

260
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,770
Wanted to They're

261
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,189
Built It for Their Exact purpose if They Wanted

262
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,589
It also has a Built in compression using Snappy Which is also by Google and

263
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,519
Snappy is its main criteria Is to be fast you know Snappy

264
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,540
So That's why the key That's why some of The stuff Was Mangled we Can Still Read it it's not Very Good at Compression but

265
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
It'S a Very Very Fast Compression

266
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,119
So now let me know we're Dealing with Level DB Let's Let's take a look at some of these artifacts

267
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,000
so the first one we're going to check Out oh yeah it's a Level Db

268
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,899
First One is the file system so the file system is another Just like local storage is another HtMl5 way of storing Information

269
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,659
so local storage is Kind of like Key value Pairs

270
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,928
File System Is more Like It's like a virtual file System if the website wants to store Things Kind of Like With full files and

271
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,749
Folders and in the structure you can use the file system

272
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,469
So let's Just Jump in to the file system folder

273
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,749
So the Very top there there's an ls and Basically see the contents of That folder so there's a bunch of these

274
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:29,689
Sub directories That Are Named Like 0 0 0 all the Way through 0 of 34 in this case so there's 35 of these Folders

275
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,658
Then There's an origins folder into plugins folder and

276
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,188
The Next step i'm Just taking a Look inside one of Those Folders and so, the fifth one and

277
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,740
There's a P folder and a T folder That Stands for persistent and Temporary so there's like Two versions of This

278
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,619
Filesystem There's The One That's be Temporary and one this was to hang Around a Bit longer

279
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,710
but It also The same Kind of structure

280
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,820
And Inside the persistent one

281
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,928
There's another Folder It's like 0 0 and inside there there's Just a file with an 8 digit integer and it'S 13

282
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,150
And If You'd like a Stat or something or You'd like a file in that file it's gonna it's Just like

283
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,699
we'll file it's like you find like an external file in the cache it's Just like a Text file or

284
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,918
An Image or whatever happens to be stored there

285
00:20:08,889 --> 00:20:13,889
But Then in that Paths folder You see all those different like There's a Log file lock file so again this looks like a Level

286
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,559
Db And if you open up that Level they be and Read the information

287
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:22,949
It's how It translates the the file system with the folders and the structure that the website sees and so this This is zero for

288
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,999
The The zero zero folder and then This Thirteen so it's how you map different back back and forth

289
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:29,379
and If you look in That

290
00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:33,569
Origins folder at The Very top that also has a Level DB in it in that Maps these

291
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:37,257
From 0 0 through 34 It Maps all Those into the website origin

292
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:43,529
Right so it Kind of Similar to how the database was Named in the local storage like pinterest Whatever That's how it maps Here?

293
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:48,539
So it's basically The Layout we can find all the different raw files that are stored in the file system but

294
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:51,989
Ok That's cool What uses this and Why do we care so

295
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,379
Has Anybody Used mega or Heard of mega

296
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:57,789
It's uh?

297
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,228
It comes Up in investigations Every once in a While i mean It has a Reputation for

298
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,899
you Know sharing some probably not so Good Things

299
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,229
But there are perfectly

300
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:10,769
Perfectly legitimate Uses for It allah i know a Lot of Forensic People share Like Disk images or challenges on there Because of You 50

301
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,979
Gigs for free

302
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,549
and so this IS me downloading one of Those Challenges

303
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,939
But The Way mega Works When you download Things is Very different like You download It and It Shows Up in this progress bar inside

304
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
The website and then When it finishes

305
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,679
There's a Chrome The Normal Chrome that single pop at the bottom That'll finish Really Really Fast like Way more Faster Than It could Actually

306
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,679
Be downloading from something

307
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:36,419
So a mega is Doing is it'S downloading the file into the local fat into the the file system from chrome and then it's Doing

308
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,498
A local Copy from the file system to your downloads folder so That's Way The second Ones the super super quick

309
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,977
And Mega Is also Now that Good about cleaning Up after itself so i found files have Been downloaded in the file system sect area?

310
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:49,379
Like Months After They were

311
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:55,767
Downloaded and the Actual and that Usually had copy had Been Deleted or modified or Whatever so it's Very interesting place to find files

312
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:02,668
And so Unfortunately for the file system That's like One of The few Things in chrome That You can't

313
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:07,348
Look At You can't Inspect with developer tools so That's Kind of Annoying But someone built an Extension

314
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,700
Called file System Explorer

315
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,210
Extended The Basically Added in there then you can Kind of Browse the file system so with mega you can See there's Just One folder

316
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,689
Called Mega and There's This like a Character name file That happens to college the url if you don't look Closely at it

317
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:24,890
But You can Have these Actually Big more complicated file structures This Ones This one is really Simple

318
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,549
so this is Google docs Google docs also Makes Use of

319
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,948
This Again It's not Super Genic Google products Make Heavy use of The AdVanced Features and Other Google products

320
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,708
so here in Google docs i found tons and tons of Files in there in my Experience Has Mostly Been images and fonts

321
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:40,919
So if images are key Your

322
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,509
Investigation i found things that are that are pretty Dated in here so it might be an interesting place to look

323
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,520
and so When you're deciphering

324
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,230
Things custer's You Gears a Little Bit

325
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,939
You don't always have to i mean iF something's Pretty straightforward to the cipher maybe you Just want

326
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,940
To do that for you and so You can Spend all YouR

327
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,649
Analysis cycles on figuring Out how that fits into your bigger

328
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,160
Investigation so there's no shame in that You don't do everything everything Manually were cyber Stuff Whatever

329
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:06,140
So i the open-source prints to forensics tool Called Hindsight and so I Just built the ability

330
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,709
To parse his file system into Hindsight so if you Just look at

331
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Various time set Before

332
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,918
They're the most common Way to view is an Excel after i finished processing

333
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,290
The first tab Is a Timeline and I've Added a New tab for storage Because This one Doesn't Really fit well into a Timeline

334
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,369
So basically The first column is to type whether a persistent or Temporary

335
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,309
The Second column Is the Origin so this is like you know a Top-level folder translated its This One's mega for Example

336
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,069
The Third column is in that logical path that the

337
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,299
Website Would have Seen so it's like the folder structure and in the last column is iF you actually Want

338
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,349
To find that file in the users Chrome profile That's the path to that if you want

339
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,468
to grab It so it's pretty straightforward but it's Just Doing a little Bit of translating for you

340
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,949
So this file System That's Pretty quick but i got a lot of Stuff to go through

341
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,559
okay so we got that so Let's Go check out Index Db so Index Db

342
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,100
From Doing a Little Bit of Googling is another Way That

343
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,230
Modern Web Browsers can Store Information right so local storage Key value file System to the file system

344
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,839
Index Db Is more object Oriented so you can Store You still have a gate like a name of a Value But then the value

345
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,149
Is

346
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,999
TyPically Like a Big object You Have nested structures so it's Kind of like Json i mean it's not but it's the same Kind of

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,540
Idea so

348
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,889
The Cool part about

349
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,559
Index Db Is that You can Access it to the developer tools so we don't have any Hacking so i'll show you some

350
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,690
Examples of What You could see in here

351
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:29,209
So again netflix Pretty common Application People to use you can find some interesting

352
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,779
Formation in there so there's like The device id on the thing you're using?

353
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,119
I don't know if you can Read it but There's some iP

354
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,850
Addresses in That Second key i checked that Does correlate to the ip Address of my machine When i was viewing this so i

355
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,940
Mean I don't Know Every mitigation is different but Maybe Having some corroboration IP Address might Be helpful helpful for you but

356
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,269
So Just there's Lots of interesting Stuff to explore these Other like

357
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,509
Alternate Ways to store data so i'm Just Kind of want to highlight some of Those

358
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:59,600
Now we've twitter Everybody Loves twitter especially for This Conference we're Very active on it

359
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:04,009
So there's a data key in there and the Next Db i think Called Conversations

360
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,870
and Basically It Has One Column is the twitter Handle that The second column is the

361
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,959
Twitter id Does This Unique value and Then Over Here there's this Big nested Thing of Conversation so basically is showing Every

362
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,168
Like Twitter person that I've interacted with i guess in the conversation so again that could be could be interesting or it could Be Useful

363
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,789
And I'm Just Cherry Picking Some Random Things there's lots more Information with all These websites

364
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,710
And

365
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,130
The Next One is Google drive right so i actually have a Very Good presentation about Google drive There's a Ton information There from the

366
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,609
Api There's Some more information Here in the indexeddb

367
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,008
Just Mean Just Glancing At It like i can see My name Written in plain text i can see an application that i know i've

368
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,050
Granted Access to Google drive that doc up down there in the first three or four rows

369
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,129
Look Like something Compressed to me right that Doesn't like even Human readable it

370
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,889
Also Doesn't Look like Look like Lz strings so i'm sure it'S some other compression but again there could be lots of Very Juicy Information

371
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,440
and All These Places

372
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,859
so when you're doing these Kind of Investigations

373
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,529
Or these Kind of decide Heart deciphering sometimes you Need to kind of Explore data and you want to build something like Just

374
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Making Pulling Out These Blobs

375
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,500
From

376
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,480
Leveldb Is Pretty complicated

377
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,469
Leveldb You can Stir the name of the key is Just a Bit Just Arbitrary string of Bytes and the value Just some bytes so

378
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,980
It Makes It Really Flexible for The author

379
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,079
Or the user of the application to make It use however they want It Makes It Hard if you're trying

380
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,889
To make sense of What They're doing

381
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,020
And so you might want. To take some time to Kind of Explore What's going on

382
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:38,720
So there's This awesome tool Called Jupiter You used to be called ipython Notebook but Now it's Been Updated to be called Jupiter

383
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,889
and Like all People in data science Really Like It there's Lots of Other People That like Jupiter

384
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,690
It's a Really flexible Tool and i hope It gets to more it'S more Loving the forensics community

385
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,080
so basically The basic idea that Jupiter is that you have a

386
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,550
Notebook Which is like a web page

387
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,029
and Inside the Notebook there is a Bunch of Cells and

388
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,880
The Cells you can Put different Kinds of content in them so one of The things you put in there is Markdown Which is like

389
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,999
The Way to make a Nicely formatted text so you can Kind of Explain What's going on

390
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,009
You can Also Put code in there you put pyThon or R or a Host of Other Languages and you can Even mix what you're

391
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:16,219
Doing Inside that we Can Run Shell Commands so you make these Really powerful Mixed Kind of Like Play Books you can Almost Call them

392
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:22,070
And the cool thing about code is you can Put youR code in there and then Below It you can Actually Run It then you

393
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,340
Can See the output of your code and It Doesn't Matter if your code breaks

394
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,290
You can Still See that error in there it Doesn't nuke the Whole Thing so it's really Good When you're Exploring Because you might want

395
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,109
to document your entire process not Just the final product right You can write a Python script and write some comments in it but i

396
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,620
Mean That Only goes so far then It takes a Lot Man You live free if you want to run It and then Put the

397
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,250
Output back in there it's Just a Mess

398
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,380
This Makes It Really Easy and Makes It portable You can Share My Github or share them and all the other Places

399
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,720
So it's a Nice portable Way

400
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,670
to look at Things and Like This super cool Example from the basic website is you can you can bet interactive

401
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,950
Animations in there if You do Crazy Stuff with Javascript to make Make Things That zoom in and Stuff so basically you can do a

402
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,950
Lot of Really interesting Stuff That You Patern

403
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,179
so this is my Jupiter Notebook for decoding Stuff When the Indexeddb in order to make a Nice Little Kind of structured Information

404
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,860
so the top here i

405
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,968
Have some Markdown I'm explaining What'S going on i'm doing some then in that i switch over to a code cell and I'm Pointing This

406
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,229
Python they go grab at my my netflix Index Db It Looks Like

407
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,889
Instead since i Said was Saying Like Is a Bunch of Arbitrary Bytes You have to do some decoding of These structures in order to?

408
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,920
Make sense of anything so i saw one of the structures that They use is it's called a bar in or a Variable Length integer

409
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,380
In the quick version of how Those Work is?

410
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,240
Yeah but it's Just a stream of Bytes and if the first bit and that Byte is said that means there's more Bytes

411
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,670
To come if it's not said that means that the last byte and so basically you Just look through all of them and then you

412
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,150
Basically Take Out The lower 7 bits and Basically You combine These Things like That I'm sorry There's a Simple Function Here for decoding the

413
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,859
var n

414
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,999
But then i'm gonna put Example right Below It to show you how it works so

415
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:03,488
I'm burning My Example see the code bar in i put in de oh for as like the input and then i get out

416
00:29:03,649 --> 00:29:08,108
That translates into the integer value of 606 and a Length of 2 like alright Cool That's Nice

417
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,129
but i also Wanted Like

418
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:16,509
Show you or like Show the person That's reading This whether it's it's another analyst or me in four months When i forgot what i

419
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:20,708
Was Doing That's That's the real reason to make comments and you remind your future self What you were thinking at the time

420
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:26,199
It's like If You scroll down you see okay i'll put the same to start Values in there but i'll put a bunch of Random

421
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:32,168
Random Bytes Afterwards and The Way Vardhan's Work They don't care right that is because the second Byte the first

422
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:37,869
Bit Was a Zero It means It Stopped reading so it Gives you the same output right 606 the length of two so this guy

423
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:41,227
Just Kind Of illustrate That Example by putting The Example in the Notebook

424
00:29:43,069 --> 00:29:46,178
So another interesting Thing about leveldb and

425
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,339
Indexdb is That

426
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:53,499
So level to be it's so fast because Basically it's a Giant table of sort of strings and

427
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:58,388
Again With It being flexible You can sort Those strings However you want so there's

428
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:01,208
The Way That Works Internally is There's a Thing Called a

429
00:30:01,729 --> 00:30:07,809
Comparator and so the Normal One is called a bitwise comparator and it's i think it's pretty straightforward so if he's open and all the

430
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,778
Db With no, no compared or specified it'll assume that one

431
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:16,719
But You can also specify custom One if you want to sort Things in your own custom Way and if you don't specify

432
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:21,189
The Right Compared to the Level Db Will Say Sorry I'm not gonna open then you're Kind of stuck

433
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,918
so index Db Has its own comparator

434
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:30,519
Which is somewhere in the C code online for Chromium but i don't know i couldn't figure that out

435
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:35,889
So i just made a Fake comparator that Basically Is normal comparator but i changed The name and there's a different

436
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:38,378
Library For Reading This Called Pliable

437
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,238
And That takes It and so Here i put that in there i'm explaining What i'm Doing That opens my database and

438
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:47,528
I've Kind of Explain What'S going down and as i go down further i'm Actually Pulling others Stuff

439
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:49,399
But That's you know all this

440
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,279
Python walking Through Thing Is more You know Better forum for a Blog post or i don't know a Python Notebook

441
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,658
So i'm Just gonna not i'm gonna Kind of Stop there with that part but if you want more iF you're interested in that you

442
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,659
Can Check Out the Notebook it'll be online
