1
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,610
(applause)

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,948
- I am Tim Ball, I
currently am a professor

3
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,550
at Southern Utah University.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,819
Been there almost a year now.

5
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,354
Prior to that, I was,

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,223
I'll just give you a little
bit of background on myself

7
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,491
very quickly.

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,493
Prior to that, I was
at a private college

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,261
in Central New York,

10
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,964
you can probably
just research that

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,631
and see what it was.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,638
The incident that I
am talking about today

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,974
was at that college,

14
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,309
not the one that
I'm currently at.

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,080
And before I was the
college professor type,

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,614
out in central New York,

17
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,650
there's the air force
research laboratory,

18
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,285
I was there for quite a while

19
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,455
as their lead researcher
for cyber operations.

20
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,858
And I was recruited
by the air force

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,959
while working for the navy

22
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,364
at their naval
undersea warfare center

23
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,865
in information insurance.

24
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,300
So I have not been, and
I'm telling you all this

25
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:10,804
so that I can just say I
have not been in academia

26
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,672
for very long.

27
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:15,675
Are there any
academics, academians,

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,279
what do you call them?

29
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,181
People like me, here today,

30
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,116
that teach at a college
or a university?

31
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,251
A few.

32
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,253
Any students here today?

33
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:32,625
Full time,
professional students.

34
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:36,930
After today, if you decide
that you want to cheat,

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,000
you might wanna rethink
your method for cheating.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,536
This is a case
study in cheating.

37
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,338
This is something that
actually happened.

38
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,607
I'll go into what
all of this is.

39
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:52,212
This is a real case,
this actually did happen.

40
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,516
What I have come to realize
in my short time in academia

41
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,619
is that cheating is
fairly widespread.

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,387
It kind of shocked me.

43
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,690
Maybe I was a little
naive going into it,

44
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,759
but it happens often.

45
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,062
Actual events, it
really did happen.

46
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,232
I did change the
names, a lot of stuff,

47
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:14,100
some of the things you'll
see have been redacted.

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,971
I'm not here to embarrass
anybody or anything like that.

49
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,506
I'm just here to
provide information

50
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:20,940
and some techniques.

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,577
They are common tools,
they are common techniques.

52
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:29,015
I don't know that there's gonna
be anything new here for you

53
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,619
other than it's a new
application of techniques,

54
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,221
or maybe an uncommon
application.

55
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,525
What it is not is
highly technical.

56
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,994
Again, common tools,
common techniques.

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,464
You'll probably be familiar
with most of the stuff

58
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,732
I'm gonna present.

59
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,100
It's not personal.

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,236
I actually kind of
liked the student.

61
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,771
He was a good kid.

62
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,774
He was not a troublemaker
or anything like that.

63
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,212
So it wasn't personal,
it was all professional,

64
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,981
it was all something
that I just found myself

65
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,850
in the situation I had to do.

66
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,986
And it is not the first
time this has Happened.

67
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,255
Again, this is kind
of a common problem,

68
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,257
it's fairly widespread.

69
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,760
My initial purpose
for doing this

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,563
was to provide a tutorial
for other professors.

71
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,965
If you are familiar
with college campuses

72
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,168
and I'm assuming some
of you probably are,

73
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,371
the computer
forensics department

74
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,674
is not really a department.

75
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,277
Similar to a lot of law
enforcement departments,

76
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,412
the computer
forensics department

77
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,715
or branch of law enforcement

78
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,550
often is just one guy.

79
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,220
Or girl, whatever.

80
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,389
One person doing it.

81
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:48,528
So very, very small,
contained group.

82
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,131
And the rest of the college
campus, or police force,

83
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,100
or whatever, law enforcement,

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,668
is usually non-technical people

85
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,973
that sometimes are faced
with having to do something

86
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,307
technical.

87
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,743
And so this was
more of a tutorial

88
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,379
of how to do those
kinds of things.

89
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,780
All right, so the
background of the case.

90
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,517
Student A was caught and
accused of Plagiarism

91
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,019
in a computer forensics class.

92
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,425
This was the third semester
of computer forensics

93
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,526
that this happened in.

94
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,228
That means I had this person

95
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,063
for forensics one,
toe, and three

96
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,765
over the course of
three semesters,

97
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,270
and this happened at the
end of the third semester.

98
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,305
I would've thought that by
now, the students in my class

99
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,107
would've understood
that this kind of thing,

100
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,143
probably you should
not be doing this.

101
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:42,080
Student A used student B's
work from a previous semester.

102
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,151
It happened to be the
semester right before that.

103
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,586
At this particular college,

104
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,454
I was teaching forensics
one, two, and three

105
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,789
every semester.

106
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,425
There were a lot of
students coming through.

107
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,361
So student A used
student B's work.

108
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,531
Try to keep that straight
as we go through this,

109
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,766
student A and student B.

110
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,234
Student A is the
one that cheated.

111
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,604
Student B was the one that
did the original work.

112
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,173
At this particular college,

113
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,310
they had a grade
of F for cheating,

114
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,378
it actually is called
F for cheating.

115
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,647
It actually shows up
on the transcript,

116
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,849
the official transcript,
as F for cheating.

117
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,519
So if you are employing somebody

118
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,825
and you require transcripts,
take a look at them.

119
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,194
If you see an F for cheating,

120
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,229
that probably would
raise a red flag.

121
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,032
Now, the student can appeal
at the end when they graduate

122
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,801
and get that F for
cheating taken off.

123
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,436
But having talked to

124
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,471
a couple of the provosts
at the colleges,

125
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,041
sometimes they won't do that,
sometimes they'll leave it on

126
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,177
as a message to employers,

127
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,847
might wanna think about
this before you do this.

128
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,282
And of course, student
A denied any wrongdoing.

129
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,920
I would never cheat, I've
never done this before,

130
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,723
I would never do
anything like this.

131
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,392
Adamantly denied any wrongdoing.

132
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,229
And got his parents involved.

133
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,098
That's never a good situation.

134
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,500
Thankfully, I didn't have
to deal with the parents.

135
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,036
I thought for a while
I might have to.

136
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,773
But apparently, the parents
were very, very irate

137
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,677
because their son was supposed
to graduate that semester.

138
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,247
This was a private college,
tuition, kinda high.

139
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,649
Having to add another
semester on there,

140
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,019
I can assume the parents
probably were not very happy.

141
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,323
And as some of you
who are parents,

142
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,991
maybe your kid can do no wrong

143
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,260
and so you're
blaming the school,

144
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,561
you're blaming the professor,

145
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,695
you're blaming whatever,

146
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,898
the parents were not happy.

147
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,300
So let's talk about the case.

148
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,337
The informant,

149
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,274
in a lot of criminal
cases, there is a tip

150
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,709
from some informant.

151
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,577
The informant in
this particular case

152
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,146
was turnitin.com.

153
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,847
If you're not familiar
with turnitin.com,

154
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,885
this is a website
where I can put through

155
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,953
student's papers,
we use it on campus,

156
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,857
you upload all the students'
papers to turnitin.com,

157
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:08,661
it will return you an
originality report.

158
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,832
The higher the percent, the
more was copied and plagiarized.

159
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,068
So you wanna keep
that percentage low

160
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,840
if you want to fly
under the radar.

161
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,010
This particular one came
back at 30% copied overall.

162
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:33,019
In my classes, we use a template
for our forensics reports.

163
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,024
So I expect that there's
gonna be some percentage

164
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,560
of similarity between
all students' papers

165
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,929
because it's a template
for the report.

166
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,164
A lot of the
sections are similar.

167
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:48,901
Some of the wording in
the template is similar.

168
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,103
But the students write
their own reports,

169
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,372
or they're supposed to
write their own reports.

170
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,543
It came back as 18% similar
to a particular student.

171
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,947
Now, when it comes
back from turnitin.com

172
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,915
and says 18% to a student,

173
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:05,785
it shows that student if
it was one of my students

174
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,119
and I had uploaded that.

175
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,256
Well, I had access to that paper

176
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,058
because that was my student

177
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,327
and it was a
submission in my class.

178
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,830
So when you get to the
higher percentages like that,

179
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,500
it's a, I think in turnitin.com,

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,602
that's even a red flag.

181
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,905
Like a literal red
flag on the website

182
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,607
that says hey, you might
wanna look at this.

183
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,444
So I looked at it
seeing as how student B

184
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,981
was in the same class
the previous semester.

185
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,317
Took out the paper, compared
the papers side by side.

186
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,419
So I did my visual inspection,

187
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,755
I've got my evidence
in front of me.

188
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:46,158
In a lot of the cases
you might encounter,

189
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,328
you wanna do that triage step.

190
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,999
You wanna just look at
see if this is serious,

191
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,901
if this is something
that's worth pursuing,

192
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,602
if it's worth continuing on.

193
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,838
So I typically do
my visual inspection

194
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,772
just to see what's
going on here.

195
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,476
File properties
is the first thing

196
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,679
that I usually check, just
to see what's happening.

197
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,381
Check the file properties,

198
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,182
check some of the wording.

199
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,884
So what turnitin.com does

200
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,819
is it will actually
highlight and flag

201
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,954
the wording that it
found that is similar.

202
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,157
So as I put these
papers side by side,

203
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,327
I saw yeah, some of the
wording is similar in these

204
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,963
and in some cases, it
was exactly the same.

205
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,732
And the screenshots
between the two papers

206
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,900
looked the same.

207
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,168
I require that as my students

208
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,937
are going through
their investigations,

209
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,306
that they are documenting
precisely their procedure

210
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,308
and their process
and their findings,

211
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,976
and then they
provide screenshots

212
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,711
that support these
things that they have

213
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,580
and some of the screenshots
looked very similar,

214
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,215
appeared to actually
be the same.

215
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:47,219
So I have a case, I have
something that I need to pursue,

216
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,989
I have something that
needs to have a little more

217
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,157
in depth look.

218
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,663
Took a look at the
file properties,

219
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,931
it was created by me,

220
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,399
it was a template that
was passed down to me

221
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,901
from a previous professor.

222
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:06,405
I modified it, I updated it,
I did some changes to it.

223
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,808
So that's created by me,

224
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,610
I would probably expect that,

225
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,246
I've got the author's
name there crossed off,

226
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,314
but you can see
the modified there,

227
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,618
last modified by student A,

228
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,487
that's to be
expected, that's fine.

229
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,356
Two hour editing time, though,

230
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,092
that's a little suspicious to me

231
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,160
because this was an
extensive investigation

232
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,762
that they had to perform.

233
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:34,266
And it was given two
weeks before it was due.

234
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,935
So obviously, students
procrastinate,

235
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,904
obviously, they're gonna
wait until the last minute,

236
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,240
but highly unlikely
that they could

237
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,376
complete the investigation
in two hours.

238
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,112
But you have to give the
benefit of the doubt.

239
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,512
So there's really nothing here

240
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,349
in this particular
file properties

241
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,285
that says that this
was plagiarism.

242
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,125
They started it the
day before it was due.

243
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,728
So waited until the last minute.

244
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,731
It's not uncommon
that that happens.

245
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,636
As I said, this has
happened before,

246
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,039
it was in the same course,
in forensics three.

247
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,973
I know he's kind of mesmerizing.

248
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:15,908
If you stare at him too long,

249
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,245
you probably start to get dizzy.

250
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,713
I had an online version,

251
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,581
this was the first semester
that I'd actually taught

252
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,683
at a college.

253
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,788
This was when I was
adjunct for the college.

254
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,956
I was teaching the same
course, it was forensics three,

255
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,391
it was the online version.

256
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,694
I had a student that had
some family problems,

257
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,930
had some things come up
and needed some extra time,

258
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,565
asked me if they could
turn the assignment in late

259
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,669
because of these family
problems and whatnot,

260
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,771
I don't remember exactly
what the excuse was.

261
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:48,507
And I said, you know,
being my first time

262
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,443
teaching the class, I was
like yeah sure, whatever,

263
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,877
I don't care.

264
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,412
I since do care a lot.

265
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,383
My assignment policy
has changed quite a bit

266
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,552
since this first semester.

267
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,922
So I get the paper a
couple weeks later.

268
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,623
And I'm reading through it

269
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,092
and I'm having this
sense of deja vu,

270
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,960
like this all sounds
very, very familiar to me.

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,528
And part of the assignment

272
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,098
was that they had to
create a text file.

273
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,467
And just put some
random text in it,

274
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,735
it didn't matter what it was,

275
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,169
just put some text in there.

276
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,505
And this particular
student put in the lyrics

277
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,006
to Ice, Ice, Baby.

278
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,710
And then I was like oh, okay,

279
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,712
I know I have read this before.

280
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,749
And this is my first class,
so it had to be in that class

281
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,250
that I read this before.

282
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,752
So I went back and looked at
the other students' papers

283
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,886
that I'd already graded.

284
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,087
And sure enough,
there's a paper in there

285
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,589
from another student

286
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,425
that their text file has the
lyrics to Ice, Ice, Baby.

287
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,825
That's not a common thing,

288
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,194
so yeah, it stuck out.

289
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,632
And pulled up the file
properties of these two

290
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,199
because I had them side by side.

291
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,435
Again, I had both
papers right there,

292
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,369
I don't know what people think.

293
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,873
But I pull them up side by side,

294
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,475
they're almost exactly the
same all the way throughout.

295
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,745
Wording, screenshots,
layout, everything.

296
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,647
And so I pull up
the file properties

297
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,182
and sure enough, created by,

298
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,818
the student from a
couple weeks ago,

299
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,989
last modified by the student
who turned it in late.

300
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,791
So file properties,

301
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,960
yeah, and having that
evidence right there,

302
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,596
it was enough for me,
I was like okay, fine,

303
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,831
F for cheating.

304
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,367
And don't think I throw
out the F for cheating

305
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,767
just like candy.

306
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,304
That's usually in the
very very extreme cases

307
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,939
where something like
this has happened

308
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,908
where they've intentionally
stolen someone else's work

309
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,876
and tried to pass
it off as their own.

310
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,278
Normally, it's just a warning,

311
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,180
like hey, you forgot
to quote this thing,

312
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,416
you've got some text here that
is similar to your friend's.

313
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,519
Great, you're working together,

314
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,155
but just make sure
you're turning in
your own original work

315
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,957
and I'll throw a couple
warnings out to them.

316
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,226
But in cases like this
where it's extreme,

317
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,495
then yeah, highest penalty.

318
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,633
Let's go off of him.

319
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,735
So back to the original one,

320
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,205
oh, and by the way,
on that one too,

321
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,874
when I filled out
the official form

322
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,809
and I have to put
the official form

323
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,810
and I have to say
what the violation was

324
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,479
and what the result
of this thing is,

325
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,548
the student was like oh,
I've never cheated in my life

326
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,083
and I would never do
anything like that,

327
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,318
same thing,

328
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,919
and so I just replied

329
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,055
with a screenshot of
the file properties.

330
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,192
And I never heard anything back.

331
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,927
So here we are,
student A, student B.

332
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,395
This is going back
to the original one,

333
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,097
this is the case at hand,

334
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,699
the one that we're
talking about today.

335
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,568
You can see the ones that I've
highlighted there in yellow

336
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,738
are similar, so student
A took some time,

337
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,507
probably about two hours, right,

338
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,242
that was the editing
time on the document,

339
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,511
to go through and change
some of the wording.

340
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,747
But if you look in the red,

341
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,752
programs are developed in
order to make the process

342
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,585
a simpler.

343
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,791
Same errors, same
grammar mistakes.

344
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,964
And then in the yellow again,
just took a little bit of time

345
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,599
to change one or two words,

346
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,168
hoping maybe to bring that
originality score down,

347
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,870
I don't know what
the intent was.

348
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,208
I don't usually tell my
students that I do turnitin.com,

349
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,076
I thought it was
common knowledge.

350
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,579
If it's not, it probably is now,

351
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,248
since this will be posted
and they will all know.

352
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,885
This again, is the
visual inspection,

353
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,054
this is just me going through
and looking at these papers

354
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,155
side by side.

355
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,290
This is the list of figures.

356
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,893
In Microsoft Word, I have
my students do their work

357
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,895
in Microsoft Word, the
template I give them

358
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,896
is a docx file.

359
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,767
Microsoft Word, you know,
if you have the screenshots,

360
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,368
you just right click
the screenshot,

361
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,704
you do add a caption,
it puts the caption in.

362
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,774
And then Microsoft Word
will auto-generate you

363
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,678
a list of figures, table of
contents, things like that.

364
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,980
That's part of the
requirement of this template,

365
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,582
is to auto-generate these lists.

366
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,718
These references.

367
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,988
But if you take a closer
look, figure nine,

368
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,890
if you look at all of them,

369
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,858
I don't know if in the back,
you can actually see them,

370
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,560
they're all the same.

371
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,566
So that means that two students

372
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,136
labeled their screenshots
exactly the same.

373
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,439
That's highly unlikely, right.

374
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,507
And even on figure number nine,

375
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,075
I kind of expanded that one up,

376
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,111
blew it up a little bit
so you could see it there.

377
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,481
Figure nine, check washing
gogle search, or gogle,

378
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,250
whatever that is,
it's misspelled.

379
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,553
Exactly the same
on both of them.

380
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,221
So still doing the
visual inspection,

381
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,523
I'm thinking this
is open and shut.

382
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,460
This is obviously plagiarism.

383
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,128
And then I saw this.

384
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,469
Two students, I am to believe,

385
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,205
took the same screenshot

386
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,307
and highlighted it with
the red squiggly lines

387
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,742
exactly the same.

388
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,916
Third semester forensics.

389
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,587
This person has been in my
class at least three times,

390
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,923
I think I even had
him for four classes.

391
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,560
I don't know, maybe other
professors don't read papers

392
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,128
and just give a grade
and throw it back to them

393
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,463
and say here you go.

394
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,197
This one, you
probably can't see.

395
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,200
But so I put that up there,

396
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
student A, student B, again,

397
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,038
the search, they
had to do a search.

398
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,208
The search was performed on
the 24th of October in 2015.

399
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,816
If you remember from
the file properties,

400
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:35,821
the student started this
paper in March of 2016.

401
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,726
So he has some advanced notice.

402
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,530
He knew what was coming
in this class, I guess,

403
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,433
he got started
early on this thing.

404
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,702
All right, visual inspection.

405
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,573
After that, I'm like okay,
that, this is done, it's over.

406
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,608
And so I gave him
the F for cheating,

407
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,211
I did the whole paperwork thing.

408
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,513
I submitted it as
I was supposed to.

409
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,782
Again, I only do it
in extreme cases.

410
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,953
I usually give them a warning
or something like that.

411
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:12,458
But the student decided
to appeal this grade,

412
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,860
they decided to appeal
the F for cheating.

413
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,096
Because of the appeal,

414
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,331
and because of the
appeal process,

415
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,533
I needed to have something
a little more solid here.

416
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,435
I needed to do more than
just the visual inspection.

417
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,638
If the student follows
the appeal process

418
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,474
all the way to the end,

419
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,309
then it'll go
before a committee,

420
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,078
and I needed to just
have something that was,

421
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,013
you know, undisputable.

422
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,283
So the tools.

423
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,017
I like 7-zip.

424
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,055
I'm sure you
probably know 7-zip.

425
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,457
I like my tools to be portable,

426
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,859
I like them to be standalone,

427
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,659
I don't like to have
to install stuff.

428
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,430
I like to have my toolbox
on my little thumb drive.

429
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,600
7-zip is great for
that, I love 7-zip.

430
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:00,004
HxD, same thing, small,
lightweight, hex editor.

431
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,475
Don't have to install it,

432
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,478
just run it from
the executables,
portable, standalone,

433
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,048
and some file hashing.

434
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,383
So those are the
things that I used.

435
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,053
Again, common
techniques, common tools,

436
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,657
things you've probably seen
before many, many times,

437
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,626
probably used many, many times.

438
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,829
For those, maybe
who aren't familiar,

439
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,565
again, the audience was
non-technical people,

440
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,400
for non-technical professors

441
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,102
who probably have to
use something similar.

442
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,404
So I give a little
description of file hashing,

443
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,072
it checks for the
file integrity,

444
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,073
it checks to see if the
file has been changed,

445
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,410
it checks to see if two
files are exactly the same,

446
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,346
if there's any difference,
then that message digest,

447
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,815
that resulting number that's
calculated from the file

448
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,551
would be different.

449
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:50,054
File hashing, as you know, is
a many to one relationship,

450
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,124
where there could
actually be collisions,

451
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,526
and the collision is when
two files that are different

452
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,029
result in the same hash value.

453
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,935
It's uncommon, I think in
this particular presentation,

454
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,672
I used SHA-1, which
thanks to Google,

455
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,907
we don't use anymore, right?

456
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,375
Or shouldn't.

457
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,578
But at the time, Google
hadn't released their stuff.

458
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,148
SHA-1 was suspected
to be compromised,

459
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,951
but again, for my purposes,
for what I was doing,

460
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,652
it was good enough.

461
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,654
So file hashing, I used,

462
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:27,326
just to see if I could find
any kind of evidence there

463
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,561
with file hashing and
see what was going on.

464
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,064
All right, so here's
my little demo of HxD

465
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,668
doing a file hash.

466
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,008
Analysis, check sums,
and choose the SHA-1,

467
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,011
and boom, calculates
your check sum.

468
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,716
Fixed length, depending
upon the algorithm you used.

469
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:55,787
So this is fixed length,
there is only a certain number

470
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,456
of hash values available,

471
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,092
but unlimited number of
files that you can hash.

472
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,428
So again, you get that
many to one relationship.

473
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,198
But for our purposes,
for my purposes,

474
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,766
the SHA-1 was good.

475
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,437
All right, so file hashing.

476
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,274
Again, in another example,

477
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,744
what I was demonstrating
is a small change

478
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,478
to the text in the file.

479
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,015
So the original file
said hello world, period.

480
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,617
The second file, hello
world, exclamation point,

481
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,620
resulted in an entirely
different hash value,

482
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,623
something that you could
easily just look at quickly

483
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,727
and say oh yeah, the files
are completely different

484
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,396
because the hash values
are totally different.

485
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,765
It's not like, off by one
character or one number,

486
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,335
anything like that,
extremely different.

487
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,371
All right, so I
have the two papers,

488
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,307
I have to build this case.

489
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,410
I have both word
docs, they were docx

490
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:58,083
and docx is a file
container, like a zip file.

491
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,320
So first thing I
did is I used 7-zip

492
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,922
and I extracted the docx files,

493
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,859
I extracted all the information,

494
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,295
all the artifacts, everything,
from the docx files.

495
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:15,801
I accessed the original images
that were used as screenshots

496
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,170
within the documents,
and I created hashes

497
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,940
of those screenshots
from both papers.

498
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,176
So here we are with 7-zip,

499
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:28,480
extracting my docx, again,
a tutorial for those who

500
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,782
have maybe never
done this before,

501
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,684
extracting a docx file.

502
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,922
Okay, boom, you can see
now I have a new directory

503
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,824
called student A.

504
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,593
If I go into the documents
and into student A,

505
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,162
open up the Word folder, media,

506
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,834
there's all the screenshots.

507
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,771
So then I could
take the screenshots

508
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,972
and I could hash them.

509
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:55,607
Now, what I did not do

510
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:57,843
is I did not use a
command line tool

511
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,012
that would hash the
entire directory,

512
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,647
all the images at the same time.

513
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,716
You can do that, there are
tools that we use in forensics

514
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,853
that do that
automatically for us.

515
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,988
But again, remember
the audience here

516
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,690
was more of a
non-technical audience.

517
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,625
And so I wanted to show a way

518
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:16,895
that could be done
easily through a more,

519
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,997
I don't wanna say user
friendly interface,

520
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,565
but a more common interface

521
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,434
that they might be used
to doing something with.

522
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,136
So rather than
going command line,

523
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:28,005
that's why I took
it through the HxD,

524
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,510
so that they actually
had a GUI and a tool

525
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,345
and something that
worked nice for them,

526
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,946
that they didn't have to type
stuff in on a command line,

527
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,281
stuff like that.

528
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,783
All right, so going
back to this one here,

529
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,450
it's obvious by looking at it,

530
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,886
that these two are the same.

531
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,387
But when you take
the hash values,

532
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,156
you can see the
hash values prove

533
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:48,326
these are the same image
from student A and student B.

534
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,631
All right, final
nail in the coffin.

535
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,303
I give the same investigation
semester to semester.

536
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,372
It changes after a while,

537
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,977
but what I do is each semester,
I change certain things

538
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,214
about the assignment,

539
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,715
so I'll ask different questions,

540
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,118
I'll say something like on
this date, at this time,

541
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,287
how many files were created.

542
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,491
Or give me a regular expression
for finding phone numbers

543
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,828
and how many phone
numbers did you find

544
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,730
on this drive that
we're investigating,
something like that.

545
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,432
So every semester,
there's about four or five

546
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,534
of these things that during the
course of the investigation,

547
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,871
they have to find these
specific things on that drive

548
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,407
during that investigation.

549
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,908
And those change.

550
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,678
And they change for a good
reason, because of this.

551
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,315
Student A answered the questions
from the previous semester.

552
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,385
So again, when confronted
with this, the verdict,

553
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,391
so the student first
went to student affairs,

554
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,693
that's their first stop

555
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,194
if they wanna appeal the grade.

556
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,130
Student affairs guy and I
kind of knew each other.

557
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,533
He called me up on the phone

558
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,235
and he says hey, what's
the story with this one,

559
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,703
he's disputing it.

560
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,906
And all I told him was well,
he's got two screenshots

561
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,007
in his paper,

562
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,043
I didn't go into
the whole thing.

563
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,478
Two screenshots, and the
dates on those screenshots

564
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,214
are from the previous semester,

565
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,183
there's no way
they could be his.

566
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,185
And I gave a little more detail,

567
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,354
some of the wording is
similar, I think I told him,

568
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,588
and he's like oh, okay.

569
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,124
He advised the student
not to pursue this,

570
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,393
the student affairs guy
knew me fairly well.

571
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:32,030
But the student decided to
appeal further up the chain.

572
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,764
Went to the program director,

573
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,368
I think because the program
director was his advisor,

574
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,370
typically you would go
to the department chair,

575
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,803
that's kind of the
chain of command.

576
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,506
But anyway, he went to
the program director.

577
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:45,777
Program director took him in
to see the associate dean.

578
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,046
The parents were involved
this whole time, by the way,

579
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,082
so parents were at student
affairs pitching a fit.

580
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,285
Parents were in the
program directors office

581
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,386
having a fit.

582
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,357
I can't testify to that, I
wasn't there, I don't know,

583
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,927
I was just told that they
were very, very upset.

584
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,529
So the associate dean
called me into the office.

585
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,698
So I'm in the office
with the associate dean

586
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:09,034
with the program director,
the department chair,

587
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,137
who finally got
involved with this,

588
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,139
and I think there
was one other person,

589
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,775
I can't remember who that was.

590
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,710
But the associate dean
also knew me very well,

591
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,612
knew that I don't
just do these things

592
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:23,982
because I want to
be cruel to anybody.

593
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,951
He says so, what do
you got going on here.

594
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,854
And I said well, and I had
copies of the two papers with me

595
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,156
when I went in.

596
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,124
And I said the papers
are very, very similar,

597
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,426
they're almost exactly the same,

598
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,860
the screenshots are the same.

599
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,029
And he basically took
this other guy's paper

600
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,331
and turned it in as his own.

601
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,631
I didn't even give
him the papers,

602
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,866
I didn't show him the papers,

603
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,435
he was just like
okay, that's fine.

604
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,104
So they denied the
appeal to the student.

605
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:50,275
Next step for the student
is to go to the provost.

606
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,113
So I get called into
the provost's office,

607
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,781
and if you don't know
what a provost is,

608
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,515
because I really didn't
know what a provost was

609
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,319
until a couple years ago,

610
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,056
the provost is the head
guy over all academics.

611
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,325
So he's like my boss' boss.

612
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,896
And he calls me into his office,

613
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,767
I'm sitting there like in the
principal's office as a kid,

614
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,236
thinking I'm in trouble,

615
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,871
but you know, I'm
not in trouble,

616
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,539
I didn't do anything wrong.

617
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,075
But this kid's parents
are having a cow.

618
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,679
So he calls me in and
he says what's going on.

619
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,649
And I said well, he took
someone else's paper

620
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,751
and turned it in for his own.

621
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,786
And again, I had the papers,
I had all this stuff,

622
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,788
I had this stack,

623
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,923
and he's like okay,
well the student said

624
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,625
that he only took
two screenshots.

625
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,127
I'm like oh, yeah, okay,

626
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,828
because that's what I told
the student affairs guy,

627
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,297
right, was that he only
took those two screenshots,

628
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,832
I didn't say that,

629
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,534
but that's what this student,
he kind of latched onto that,

630
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,336
and he's like no, no, I only
took those two screenshots

631
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,671
that had the wrong date.

632
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,206
I'm like no, it was
everything, I told the provost,

633
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,741
it was everything.

634
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,877
So he says well, there's
two different stories here

635
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,412
so we gotta get
everybody together

636
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,881
and let's, you know, come in
and have a chat about this

637
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,716
and let's talk about it.

638
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,284
So that's when I went
and built the whole case.

639
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,821
When I had to go in
front of the provost

640
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,389
and I had to
confront the student

641
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,389
and I'm thinking in my head

642
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,591
that I'm gonna have to confront

643
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,926
some pretty angry parents too,

644
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,294
that's when I had to
build the whole case.

645
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:21,332
So I come in to that
meeting, a few days later,

646
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,169
I've got like this
stack of stuff.

647
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,772
And I'm sitting there,
I'm ready to go.

648
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,075
I'm like all right, get
these parents in here,

649
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,576
the student, whatever.

650
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,846
I was ready, I had
everything I needed.

651
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,882
And the student sits down,
the parents didn't come in,

652
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,784
I don't think the
parents were even there.

653
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:41,286
The student came in, sat down,

654
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,620
the provost says

655
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,060
we're here because there's
two different stories.

656
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,928
He says to the student
you're telling me

657
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,198
that you took two
screenshots and that was it,

658
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,300
but professor Ball is telling me

659
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,802
that it was the whole paper,

660
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,605
what story is the right story.

661
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,674
The student kind of
looks down and he says

662
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:03,908
the second one.

663
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,412
So finally after all that time,

664
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,547
the truth comes out.

665
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,884
I sat there in that meeting
and didn't say a single word.

666
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,955
I didn't say anything,
the provost laid into him,

667
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,956
like read him the riot act,

668
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,458
of all the time that was wasted

669
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,861
and all these other
resources and everything.

670
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,362
I didn't say anything,
I just sat there

671
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,865
with my stack of papers.

672
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,867
So lesson learned for me

673
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,870
is if this ever comes up again,

674
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,439
just walk in with
a stack of papers.

675
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,909
That's all you need, you don't
need any of the rest of this.

676
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,844
Just a stack of papers.
