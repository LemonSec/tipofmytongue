1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,602
(trance music)

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,477
(applause)

3
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,212
- Sweet (laughs)

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:14,614
So, I'm gonna talk about
Google Drive Forensics

5
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,518
and, this came from a
case that I worked on.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,286
I'm a programmer, primarily,

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,522
so I don't do a
lotta customer work,

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,590
but when I do, it's
usually something

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,460
either very complicated,
time consuming,

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,862
that's not gonna be
super fun for me,

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,462
or something that I've
never looked at before,

12
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,098
and is gonna be
really interesting.

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,268
So, this is one of the
really interesting ones.

14
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,171
So, I'm gonna go through
a couple of things today.

15
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,607
Some of them are things that
you can just download in a UI,

16
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,775
and some of it is gonna
require a little bit of code.

17
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:47,447
So, there's a little bit
of something for everyone.

18
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,115
So, the first thing
I'm gonna talk about

19
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,420
is the G Suite Admin
Console, and that's a

20
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,089
admin piece of software.

21
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,158
You would see it in a
UI if you are the admin

22
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,193
for your Google
Drive environment.

23
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,428
If you're just a regular user,

24
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,196
you're not gonna be
able to see this.

25
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,397
It depends on what access
you're going to have.

26
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,267
I'm gonna talk about
Manual Forensics.

27
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,701
So, if you have access
to the document,

28
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,070
and you're gonna be
downloading things,

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,104
or trying to figure
out information

30
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,405
about that specific document,

31
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,940
things that you can do there.

32
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,375
Some interesting API's,

33
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,943
including the Google Drive API,

34
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,411
and the Apps Activity API,

35
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,647
and then some Cloud
Backup Solutions

36
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,416
that you might see
in environments.

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,618
So, if you've never seen
the G Suite Admin Console,

38
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,321
you've never been an admin
for your Google Drive

39
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,692
or Google apps, this
is what it looks like.

40
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,261
And there's a lot of great
buttons: billing, whatever.

41
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,696
We don't care about
that for forensics,

42
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,898
but we do care about
this Reports button.

43
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,267
So you're gonna click
yourself this Reports button

44
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,634
and you're gonna see
a bunch of reports

45
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,437
that look like this.

46
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,606
So this is a UI
where you can search

47
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,173
for activity based off of user,

48
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,876
based off of document title,

49
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,779
and you can see things
like Download history.

50
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,615
So there's View, Edit,
and Download history.

51
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,550
Now, we know from forensics
that even though we see

52
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,954
that somebody clicked
View, it doesn't mean

53
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,189
that they read it.

54
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,524
And then, also here, if
somebody downloaded an item,

55
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,759
it doesn't necessarily mean

56
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,495
that they clicked
the Download button.

57
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,496
So there's a few caveats here

58
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:11,064
that I wanna talk through.

59
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,632
This should be something
that seems very obvious,

60
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,269
like, "Oh, it says Download;
they obviously downloaded it."

61
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,604
Not the case.

62
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,038
So the first thing that
you'll notice here is

63
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,040
that there's two
download events.

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,242
They're one right
after the other

65
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,777
for the same thing,
and if I were to scroll

66
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:27,714
a little bit further,
you would actually see

67
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,549
that it's from the same person.

68
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,484
So you'll see multiple
download events

69
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,021
for the same thing, and
that basically just means

70
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,023
this thing took a little
while to download,

71
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,859
so we're logging the
event a couple of times.

72
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,127
So download events
don't always mean

73
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,362
the user clicked Download.

74
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,464
They could be related
to a desktop application

75
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,366
that's automatically
downloading things

76
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,569
to a user's folder on
their own computer.

77
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,171
So what do we do then?

78
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,906
We actually have to
do some disk forensics

79
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,408
to see if they
edited, or viewed,

80
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,775
or did something
with that document

81
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,311
once it was on disk.

82
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,812
Because, perhaps they
didn't even log in

83
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,015
to Google Drive in
the first place;

84
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,617
it was just an
automated process.

85
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,119
And then, based on observation,

86
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,154
it seems like these events
are logged at intervals.

87
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,489
So that means I'm
downloading this file,

88
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,690
I'm streaming it.

89
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,625
It could log a dozen times.

90
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,594
It doesn't mean I clicked
Download a dozen times.

91
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,563
It means that it took
a while to download,

92
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,065
and I'm seeing all these events.

93
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,202
So, based off of currently
available fields,

94
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,337
it's really hard
to differentiate,

95
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,572
if I see a dozen of
those download events,

96
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,776
whether the button was
hit once, twice, 10 times,

97
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,544
or what application was used

98
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,647
for that download
activity to happen.

99
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:35,915
And then the last caveat here

100
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:39,418
is events only go back
so far on this report.

101
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,687
So, at my latest customer,

102
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,156
I only had 180 days of data.

103
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,925
It could be less than that.

104
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:47,360
So you're not just
going to be relying

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,329
on these logs, but
if you do have access

106
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,831
to them, this is a
great place to start.

107
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,934
I also wanna show you
what the Email Usage,

108
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,669
the Email Logs, look like.

109
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,071
You're not going to
be able to get any

110
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,439
of the content of the messages

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,406
or search through them.

112
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,841
This is for headers.

113
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,042
So it could be interesting.

114
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,179
You can see here
they're quarantining

115
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,647
this message for some reason.

116
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,881
It looks like a
social security number

117
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,383
is being sent through.

118
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,285
All of these images
are taken from blogs

119
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,686
from Google, by the way,

120
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,689
so you will see
these exact examples

121
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,159
and you'll be able to
take a closer look.

122
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,829
But these are just
kind of interesting.

123
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,030
I've been asked about it before.

124
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,265
It's there.

125
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,799
Not the primary
focus of my talk,

126
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,534
but I do want you to know
that that's a possibility.

127
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,005
Again, you can't search or
view email contents here.

128
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,339
There are other places
where you can do it,

129
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,208
and I'll talk about
Cloud Backup Solutions

130
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,777
at the end, which would
have some of those contents.

131
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,080
And also, Google
Vault has contents

132
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,549
of Drive documents and
things like that, too.

133
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,150
But this is great for
examining the headers

134
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,186
if you need to do that.

135
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,188
So we talked a little bit about
the G Suite Admin Console.

136
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,824
I wanna talk about
Manual "Forensics",

137
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,926
and I have this in
quotes because, to me,

138
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,594
this is more of an
e-discovery activity:

139
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,498
get the document, figure
out who looked at it,

140
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,466
put that in a report,
package it up nicely,

141
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,403
send it to a lawyer or
other interested party.

142
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,972
But generally, the questions
that they wanna answer,

143
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,373
at least as part
of this engagement,

144
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,009
was who looked at
something, who edited it,

145
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,680
who knew this thing existed,
who had access to it,

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,281
so the permission changes.

147
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,516
And there's actually a
bunch of different places

148
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,518
where we could look
for these things.

149
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,385
Some of them may be
available to you,

150
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,587
and some of them may not.

151
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,056
It depends of the access
level that you have

152
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,457
on the documents, the
access level that you have

153
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,062
in the Admin Console, if you
have access to that at all,

154
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,496
and a few other things,

155
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:34,633
like your API permission
levels, and things like that.

156
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,769
So one thing that you
could manually do,

157
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,071
if it's just for one document,

158
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,238
is you can just
take a screenshot

159
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,740
of the Revision History page.

160
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,008
I know that sounds
super low-tech

161
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,876
and a lotta people
in here are gonna be

162
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,143
a lot more technical than that.

163
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,579
"Come on now, show
me some code!"

164
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,481
I will, I promise, but
here's a quick, dirty thing

165
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,248
that you could do.

166
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,285
You just hit File
Revision History.

167
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,054
So here's a slide that
you already saw before,

168
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,388
but you see the green outlines,

169
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,325
and it's my user, well,
only my user here.

170
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,560
And you see, in yellow,

171
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,662
that this June 1st
date is highlighted.

172
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,531
So this is the activity
that my user account did

173
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,133
on that specific day.

174
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,668
So if somebody wants to know,

175
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,637
"Hey, did Ash edit this
slide on this day?"

176
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,139
I did! There you go.

177
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,774
There's the screenshot.

178
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,210
Pack it up, we're ready to go.

179
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,176
What if I want to print that out

180
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,513
for the entire document, though?

181
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,882
There's this print
icon on this page,

182
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,817
and I really wanted
it to print out

183
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,853
what this thumbnail
strip is showing me,

184
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,555
like this Revision History
with the cool outlines,

185
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,091
maybe saying, oh,
this user did this.

186
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:35,495
Maybe give me a cool
little icon set or key

187
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,296
in the beginning
of the document.

188
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,563
That would be amazing.

189
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,732
So if anybody from
Google's watching,

190
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,800
that would be a
great feature to add.

191
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,502
Hint, hint. Nudge, nudge.

192
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,405
But I would settle
for just getting

193
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,841
whatever version of the
document is selected

194
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,176
and exported in.

195
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,246
That's not the case.

196
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,647
So here, I've selected,
at the very bottom,

197
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,584
the May 30th version
of this document,

198
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,485
and it should be empty.

199
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,820
It was completely empty.

200
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,021
There was nothing in here.

201
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,423
I hadn't pasted
any content in yet,

202
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,392
but when I hit Print,
there's content on my slides!

203
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,361
It's giving me
the head revision.

204
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,264
So every time I do that
with Slides documents,

205
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,567
that's the PowerPoint
equivalent, Slides,

206
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,969
these are actually giving
me the head revision,

207
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,107
regardless of which revision
I have selected in the UI.

208
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,343
So forensically, this
is not fantastic for us.

209
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,946
I just want that version.

210
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,615
I'm not even concerned
about getting the outlines

211
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,786
that say who did what on
which day with which account.

212
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,122
I would settle for
having a version,

213
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,958
but that doesn't happen here.

214
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,093
So of course, we
write code to do this.

215
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,129
What other solution do we have?

216
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,331
So basically, write
something that's going

217
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,100
to render the
HTML, get the SVGs,

218
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,137
that thumb strip, blow them up.

219
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,372
Because they're SVGs,
they're re-sizeable,

220
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,808
and you can see that there's
a width and a height here.

221
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,409
So all I'm doing in the code,

222
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,578
which is on my GitHub page,

223
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,849
the very last link
there: github.com/h45h,

224
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,917
we'll be able to see that
you just re-size this

225
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,885
and you can have that version.

226
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,856
It's hacky, it's cloogy...

227
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,691
There it is.

228
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,227
We're just re-sizing it, and
then you can save it as a PDF.

229
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,695
And you can do
that all in Python.

230
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,195
There's a few other ways
that you could do that too,

231
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,933
I just chose a quick and
dirty, banged out script.

232
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,269
And there you have it.

233
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,004
But if we wanna
automate the export

234
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,706
of Non-Marked-Up Exports.

235
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,342
So when I say Marked-Up, I
mean those green outlines

236
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,111
that say Ash did
this on this day,

237
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,280
I just want some revision
without that Mark-Up.

238
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,582
Certainly, there should
be a way to do that,

239
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,584
and in some ways, there is.

240
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:40,987
But there's this bug
that's been around,

241
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,722
since, like 2014.

242
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,824
I'd put a comment
there, January 2017 is

243
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,925
when I was working
on this engagement,

244
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,663
and the issue is with
the Google Drive API.

245
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,131
If I wanted to
automate the export

246
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:56,202
of all these documents,
these slides, these sheets,

247
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,771
some of them don't seem to
return the proper revision

248
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,740
when we use the API, either.

249
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,575
And I think that may
drive some of the behavior

250
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,776
that we see in the UI.

251
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,377
Perhaps they're
using the same code,

252
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,680
or the calls to the same API.

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,180
I don't know.

254
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,018
But with Google Docs, the
PDF export seems broken,

255
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,653
so we export in a
different format.

256
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,521
I'll show you that in
a couple of slides.

257
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,123
With Sheets, all the exports
return the proper revision,

258
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,525
so (mumbling) cool there.

259
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,627
But with Slides, none of
the export formats seem

260
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,329
to return the proper revision.

261
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,765
All of them will return
the head revision.

262
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,667
And then, in version
three of the API,

263
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,068
if you're gonna try to use that,

264
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,937
the feature seems to
have been deprecated.

265
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,538
So in version two
of the Drive API,

266
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,773
that's where we're
going to be able

267
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,741
to automate the export
of these documents,

268
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,776
if you need to do that
for some e-discovery

269
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,745
or some forensics case.

270
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:44,350
However, in April, this was
assigned to ek...@google.com,

271
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,953
so if you're out there
and you're listening,

272
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:51,290
I'd really appreciate you
updating this, please.

273
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,558
So I'm gonna talk
through this API

274
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,026
that I keep talking about,

275
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,228
this mythical Google Drive
API that's gonna solve

276
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,131
some of our problems with
these automated revisions.

277
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,000
It's very cool, it's
very easy to work with,

278
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,635
and it's very well-documented.

279
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,104
So I was very
pleased to see that,

280
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,640
and it was pretty exciting to
work on something like that.

281
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,309
But version two of the
API is going to iterate

282
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,743
and download revisions.

283
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,580
There are lots of code
samples everywhere.

284
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,115
The best way to
use the API fully

285
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,651
is to be an editor or
collaborator on the document,

286
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,752
so you just have
to get added to it,

287
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,555
or you already have to be
an admin in the environment

288
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,723
and the document is public.

289
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,193
That would be a great
way to use that as well.

290
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,762
So, don't try to read the code.

291
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,296
I know people are gonna
try to read the code.

292
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
It's there for decoration.

293
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,833
If you can see it, fine.

294
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,602
But all we're doing
is taking a look

295
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,838
at the export links
for this item.

296
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,507
We're gonna get the
file ID as a parameter.

297
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,843
We're using V2 of the Drive API.

298
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,411
There's all kinds
of authentication,

299
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,647
sample code on Google's site,

300
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,117
and we're using the
word-processing doc type.

301
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,286
That's the most
important part of this.

302
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,256
When I'm doing item.get,
exportlinks.get,

303
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,959
whatever, I'm doing
the word-processing
mark-up language,

304
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,663
so the Open XML format
document type here.

305
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,898
I'm not using the PDF
'cause, again, that's broken.

306
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,266
That's gonna give us
the head revision,

307
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,602
so we're gonna use this one.

308
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,706
There's also a JSON
Structure that comes back

309
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,341
with the Drive API.

310
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,977
There's a couple of calls that
will return a JSON Structure.

311
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,713
This is the one that
I like using the most.

312
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,848
It gives me the last
person to modify.

313
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,952
That's last modifying user,
it's not every modifying user.

314
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,821
So, it's actually not going
to list all of that out

315
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,289
for this revision and say, like,

316
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,259
these 10 people modified this
and it was at these times.

317
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,493
It's only gonna give
you the last one,

318
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,629
so be really careful with that.

319
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,166
But we also have a bunch of
different formats to export.

320
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,502
You could do HTML, text/plain,
all these MIME types,

321
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:47,772
but, again, we wanna use
the word-processing document

322
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,944
Open XML format for this
if we're using Google Docs.

323
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,680
And then there's a revision ID.

324
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,214
So, every revision has an ID.

325
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,750
They're not
sequential, by the way,

326
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,318
so it's not gonna be like
one, two, three, four, five.

327
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,420
It'll be like one, and then
600, and then, like, 1,000.

328
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,756
They'll skip around
a little bit.

329
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,924
That's normal.

330
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,161
The other API that people
don't immediately think of

331
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,595
or don't find when
they're searching,

332
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,630
'cause I certainly
didn't find this

333
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,399
when I was searching initially,

334
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,667
to get a little bit
more information

335
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,402
about the history
of these documents

336
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,538
or a little bit more metadata,
is this Apps Activity API.

337
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,107
And this is pretty cool.

338
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,475
It's also really simple to use:

339
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,610
you just pop in
the Drive file ID.

340
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:28,781
This is the ID of my document,
so my Google Slides here.

341
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,487
And we get back this structure.

342
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,721
There's Permission
change events,

343
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,123
and there's Edit change events.

344
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,591
Those are the most important
ones that I've found

345
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,060
in this API return structure.

346
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,560
Again, this is really
well-documented.

347
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,465
Like, if I Google how to do
forensics on Google Drive,

348
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,234
I'm not necessarily
gonna see this first

349
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,869
because it's Apps Activity API.

350
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,971
It's not the Google Drive API.

351
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,506
But this can be
very useful for you,

352
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,175
because you can see all of
the permission changes here.

353
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,712
So here, I'm saying, oh, I
added myself as a writer,

354
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:03,149
and then I also made this
anyone can read this,

355
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,485
and anyone with the link
can view this document.

356
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,554
So you can see all of
these changes here,

357
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,422
and that's gonna answer one
of the most common questions

358
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,759
that I get about
Google Drive documents.

359
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,396
And here's the Edit
event JSON Structure.

360
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,199
So the previous one, this is
the Permission Change Events.

361
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,867
You'll get these in combination
with these Edit Events.

362
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,670
So they may be combined
into a single event,

363
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,406
or they may be in
multiple separate events.

364
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,040
So that's another
thing to watch out for

365
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,576
when you're parsing this.

366
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,878
So I actually have it parse a
couple of times, and then D2.

367
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,614
It's a little lazy,
but it's quick.

368
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,385
So we have an event time for
all of these, by the way.

369
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,488
You just have to convert this
back down to something sane.

370
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,624
You have a photo and a URL,
like a link to the photo

371
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,760
of the user, so
that's kinda cool.

372
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,961
But if the user is deleted,

373
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,362
you're not gonna see that.

374
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,966
You're just gonna see
Unknown User or Deleted User.

375
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,435
So that's one thing to be a
little bit careful of here.

376
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,636
And it's not gonna differentiate

377
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,939
between the various
deleted users.

378
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,707
It's just going to
be Deleted User,

379
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:04,476
so that's gonna make it a
little bit more difficult.

380
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,612
So, hopefully, you're
not deleting people.

381
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,514
As they leave, maybe you just,

382
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,316
decommissioning their
account somehow,

383
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,017
because you're gonna drop
off a lotta this metadata

384
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,855
in a few different places in
the API return structures.

385
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,489
So you can see this
is an Edit Event.

386
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,325
Primary event type says Edit.

387
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,359
That's great.

388
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,827
We don't know what was edited,

389
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,062
we don't know what position,

390
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,496
we don't know what
clusters were changed,

391
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,731
or anything like that.

392
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,533
We just know that this
person edited the thing.

393
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,801
And if they edited it,

394
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,903
probably means that
they had access to it,

395
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,340
and all of these other things
that you could conclude.

396
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,977
So, last thing I wanna talk
about is Cloud Backup Solutions.

397
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,981
So, the first thing you
should ask customers is,

398
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,018
"Do you have the G Suite
Admin Console access?"

399
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,553
You don't necessarily
need to have that

400
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,855
as the forensic analyst,
especially if you're coming

401
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,357
in from the outside.

402
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,958
If it's your own
internal organization,

403
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,961
maybe you do wanna have that
granted to you temporarily,

404
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,796
but you don't want to have that.

405
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,265
It's like the keys to
the kingdom, right?

406
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,467
We never want more permissions
than we actually need

407
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,702
when we're doing
an investigation.

408
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,805
It does make things
really nice (mumbling)

409
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,641
we'd have to send a
bunch of requests,

410
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,910
but generally, I like to avoid.

411
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,145
Also, "Here are
some admin creds!"

412
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,914
I don't want your
admin creds (laughs)

413
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,615
Please keep those
very far away from me.

414
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,651
I'll ask you for what I need.

415
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,521
But the next thing that
you would ask for is,

416
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,923
"Do you have a backup solution?

417
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,491
"Do you have DLP?"

418
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,927
So, some of these are
better than others.

419
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,896
I saw one quite a lot, so I'm
gonna talk about that one.

420
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,464
It's certainly not the only one.

421
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,800
It's not the best or the worst
one, or anything like that.

422
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,101
I'm not trying to
plug this at all,

423
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,102
or any of these products.

424
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,872
It's just, I've seen it,

425
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,407
and it does limit visibility
into IR activities.

426
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,044
I bring that up because,

427
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,412
if you're
investigating somebody,

428
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:50,182
maybe it's like IP
theft or something else,

429
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,551
do you really want
them to have to add you

430
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,220
to their document so that
you can pull the information

431
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,589
through the API, and all
of this other nonsense?

432
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,058
(audience laughing)
Probably not.

433
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,026
I don't want you to know that
I'm looking at this stuff.

434
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,795
So the Backup Solution
is a good place to look

435
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,130
if you want to limit the
insight that the person

436
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,665
who you're investigating,
or the activities

437
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,202
that you're investigating, has.

438
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,304
So, this is a good
place to start,

439
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,540
depending on how
stealthy you need to be.

440
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,742
Also, if there is an active
attacker in the environment,

441
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,545
I don't necessarily want them
to see the entire IR team

442
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,914
being added to these documents
that they just touched.

443
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,249
That could get a
little bit messy, too.

444
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,851
Some of them have an API,

445
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:29,021
some of them have nicely
formatted historical versions.

446
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,222
It really just depends

447
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,691
on which Backup Solution
you're dealing with.

448
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,394
So I see Syscloud; that's
the one I'm gonna show you,

449
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,729
but there are many others.

450
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,997
And I put Google Vault up here.

451
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,098
I know it's not straight
up a Backup Solution,

452
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,236
but sometimes, you
may get some revision

453
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,838
of a document as
stored in Vault.

454
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,206
Vault only shows you
and lets you search

455
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,375
through the head
revision, currently,

456
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,576
so you're not gonna
be able to search

457
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:52,044
through a bunch of
historical revisions,

458
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,146
but it's also useful, and I
kind of consider it a DLP thing.

459
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,684
Because you will have
some storage there.

460
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,520
It's a good place
to take a look at.

461
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,655
So, here's the Forensic Uses.

462
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,758
Remember I talked about
that 180-day limit

463
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,927
on those reports in the
G Suite Admin Console?

464
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,462
This is a good way
to get around that,

465
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,598
because the DLP solution,
maybe for compliance purposes,

466
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,832
they might have
to keep documents

467
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,769
quite a lot longer than that.

468
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,873
So you may have history that
you wouldn't know existed

469
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,644
if you were just looking at
the Google Drive product set.

470
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,347
So, because that
180-day or less limit

471
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,450
on G Suite reports, the
Backup Solution can provide

472
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,218
some pretty
interesting metadata.

473
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,954
It really depends on what
solution you're using.

474
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,925
So, some (mumbling)
have great sets of data

475
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,193
and they give you great APIs

476
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,362
that let you export
historical versions,

477
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,464
and that's fine, but
they're also gonna back up

478
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,765
at different
intervals from, like,

479
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,402
Google Drive (mumbling)
versions of documents.

480
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,538
So you're not necessarily
gonna have more here,

481
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,273
you're just gonna
have different.

482
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,207
And then, some solutions
do let you search

483
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,243
historical versions
of documents.

484
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,914
So let's say it backs
up every, some-interval,

485
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,316
you'll have that some-interval
version of the document.

486
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,285
Maybe it's a DIF. Who knows?

487
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,554
And some only let you search
the most recent version,

488
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:12,324
like Google Vault only lets you
search most recent versions.

489
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:13,592
And then, here is a
picture of Syscloud.

490
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,861
So, they have this Gmail backup,

491
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,497
Google Drive backup, Contacts.

492
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,499
So, in my case, I was
interested in seeing

493
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,967
the Google Drive backup,

494
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:26,472
and there were certainly
versions of the documents there.

495
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,408
(vibrant drumming)
