2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,279
one of the toughest things that people

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,859
have been asking a lot is how can you

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,419
tell someone is driving distracted it is

5
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:24,640
not a lot of fun to piece this all

6
00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,439
together so just as a warning there's

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,630
not going to be a magic tool that's just

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,630
gonna make all this data pop out for you

9

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,928
more we do like to team up on our deeper

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,969
summit presentations I'm Sarah Edwards

12
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:46,390
like Phil said I do the math class here

13
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,010
I also animal mobile forensics engineer

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,960
at Parsons corporation so I get to do a

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,089
lot of mobile stuff so it's a lot of

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,030
hope Android as well as iOS so I don't

17
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:56,498
just do the iOS side I don't like to put

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,510
that out there but I didn't touch an

19
00:00:56,499 --> 00:01:00,249
Android every once in a while and I'm

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,899
just a general Mac nerd and that's what

21
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:04,150
I do and I'm Heather

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,530
and for once Sarah's actually taller

23
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,900
than me and this graphic that's it

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,000
that's the best she's gonna get but I

25
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,270
have the sweet sweater vest which is so

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,550
special I am the senior director of

27
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,899
digital intelligence to celebrate I do

28
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,730
Android and iOS

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,630
in this presentation because I'm with

30
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,540
her I drew the Android straw and yeah

31
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:28,949
also mobile obsessed 585 is my class

32
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,420
with Lee Crabb Mellie so it's fun stuff

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,640
all right so just a little bit about the

34
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,190
set up so of course I did the iOS side I

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,900
forced Heather to do the Android side so

36
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,289
the vehicles that I use are my personal

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,820
car my phones so I have an Audi s3 if

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:44,320
you're in the DC area you'll know

39
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,509
exactly which car it is because it'll

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,580
probably cut you off and I apologize

41
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,770
and you could definitely tell who it is

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,240
by the plate I'm not gonna say the plate

43
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,399
because it's being recorded but you'll

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,869
be able to figure it out very quickly as

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,180
far as the iPhone I use my personal

46
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,550
iPhone it is a jailbroken phone it's

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,460
running iOS 12 1:1 so a lot of the

48
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,690
artifacts are very specific to that if

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:10,119
you really want to know the plate you

50
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:12,460
can read the back of our shoes so I am

51
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,410
NOT going to lie I use carplay so

52
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,620
Android auto was kind of a shock to my

53
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:20,350
system I used my car which is the GMC

54
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:25,750
Denali so I will drive over you not

55
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:28,150
around you yeah and I got lucky enough

56
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,040
that I got a really horrible Nissan

57
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,630
Sentra rental car which is terrifying

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,910
but who cares if it's your test device

59
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,380
so I plugged all of these in connected

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:37,750
through bluetooth said yes please sync

61
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,269
everything and it was kind of glorious

62
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,460
what I got there I did focus on two

63
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,800
different androids so in all fairness

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,230
the rooted one I got the most data from

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,750
which should make sense to you so full

66
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,940
physical was my best bet I do need to

67
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,370
dive a little bit more into my samsung

68
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,560
j7 prime so it does have a lot of data

69
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,270
wait for a blog on that I just didn't

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,570
have enough time to do both for all of

71
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:03,820
the Android stuff alright so let's start

72
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,220
with carplay which is the best one I

73
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,390
think we both agree on that right yes so

74
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,100
a little bit about the interface if

75
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,958
you've not used carplay before you can

76
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,450
either hook up your phone wirelessly or

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,900
connected by a vial like a lightning

78
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,519
cable USB cable my particular car and it

79
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,010
only does the through the cable

80
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,420
connection for carplay so I have not

81
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,040
tested the wireless side if you want to

82
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,839
buy me a brand new car to test that I'd

83
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,660
be happy to take a new card so if

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,040
anybody is up for that happy to do that

85
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,170
testing for you so this is the main

86
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,000
interface I plugged my phone in this is

87
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,940
what's gonna be presented on my on my

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,260
screen so it has some of the major apps

89
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,660
that you would expect for car

90
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,700
interaction but the key here is that it

91
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,959
doesn't have every app on the phone so

92
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,488
there are certain apps that I can use

93
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,470
with carplay and plenty of apps that I

94
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,300
cannot use with carplay and that's gonna

95
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,950
be kind of a distinction later on when

96
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,420
we talk about some of the correlation of

97
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,579
whether you're distracted driving or

98
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,470
things like that little bit later

99
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,990
so there are only certain applications

100
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,490
that you're allowed to use and there are

101
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,350
some third-party ones I have a whatsapp

102
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,510
here but if I flip the screen you'll see

103
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,980
a few other ones like Google Google Maps

104
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:10,200
Waze all that good stuff as well so far

105
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,390
is your basic configuration so a lot of

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,130
the artifacts that are the juicy stuff

107
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,430
is only available with a jailbroken

108
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,350
device or your grey key images your your

109
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,090
cellebrite what's it called silver

110
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,760
premium premium I know they have a new

111
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,770
fancy name for it now so some of the

112
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,440
artifacts that you can only acquire with

113
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,599
a an iTunes backup this is gonna be most

114
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,360
the configuration type stuff so we have

115
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,520
comm apple carplay dot peel is is nicely

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,740
named you can find it pretty easily just

117
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,140
doing a keyword search for it this is

118
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,730
keeping track of which cars was this

119
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,810
device actually attached to so I have an

120
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,270
example here it's got three different

121
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,300
cars you see my Audi there's a VW in

122
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,560
there as well as a Honda as well so now

123
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,330
each one of these has a gooood

124
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,610
associated with it and we can use that

125
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,770
later on to kind of a correlate which

126
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,190
car is doing what for this particular

127
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,109
device a couple other things we have

128
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,969
different icon screens for each one so

129
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,740
we have that gooood in there before it's

130
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,830
what if I wanted to see what it was on

131
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,350
Honda versus my VW things like that I

132
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,150
might have different icon configurations

133
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,260
so each one of these they'll have a few

134
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,150
of them in there if you've paired it up

135
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,099
with a few different cars but it's

136
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,719
keeping track of which icons do I want

137
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,040
on which screen so maybe I use certain

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,870
applications a little bit more than

139
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,120
others I might want to have that on the

140
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,270
first screen so it's keeping track of

141
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,150
those by the bundle ID for that

142
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:31,979
particular app now getting into some of

143
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,140
the more juicy things so this is where

144
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,360
we get into that jailbroken access most

145
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,669
of the good details associated with

146
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,169
these artifacts you have to have that

147
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,359
physical access to the device to

148
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,219
correlate all this stuff now all the

149
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,870
screenshots for carplay I am using my

150
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:48,110
Apollo tool to actually do a lot of the

151
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,970
correlation so a little bit about Apollo

152
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,280
basically takes a bunch of the different

153
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,860
databases on iOS primarily on iOS right

154
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,750
now runs a query through them and dumps

155
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,490
the information to another database in

156
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,680
this case so it helps me correlate

157
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,830
across multiple databases what's going

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,930
on with a particular device now for this

159
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,180
one I just want to show the

160
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,740
different connections so I have to plug

161
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,330
in my phone to my car

162
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,470
so I want to have plug-in events so

163
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,479
those are coming from the knowledge see

164
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,039
database and I also get from the

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,690
knowledge see database whether it's

166
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,580
connected to car play or not so I can

167
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,100
plug it in maybe just to charge it but I

168
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,560
may or may not have car play activated

169
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,419
on the device so I filtered filtered it

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,300
down here and you can see that I plug it

171
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,280
in open up car play it's doing his thing

172
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,050
and I unplug it plug it back in unplug

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,448
it plug it back in sometimes car play

174
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,160
doesn't work exactly the way you want it

175
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,539
so you have to kind of fiddle with the

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,630
connection there and you can actually

177
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:47,930
see that in the knowledge see logs for

178
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,460
Android I'm a firm believer on before

179
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,919
reinventing what's already been done

180
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,659
start with that so I read a lot of Josh

181
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,630
Hickman's stuff and talk to him a little

182
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,360
bit back and forth and he focused on in

183
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,389
- a lot so I tried to focus strictly on

184
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,789
device so instead of using the - with

185
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,960
the Android auto which in all fairness

186
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,940
half the time I couldn't even get it to

187
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,530
show up so I was like forget it I'm on

188
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,740
my device so that's what you see there

189
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:17,239
the interface is not as fancy as carplay

190
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:19,190
which I was used to I also started

191
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,110
looking through all of the files so

192
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,060
where did Josh find his stuff and could

193
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,909
I replicate it and what I immediately

194
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,610
found is it depends on the manufacturer

195
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:30,530
of the Android it depends on the OS of

196
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,570
the Android it depends on your level of

197
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,138
access and it's a giant nightmare

198
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:39,050
so Android is not as organized as an

199
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,539
iPhone is the first thing I found so you

200
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,419
can see there that bottom one where it

201
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:45,860
says 85 degrees this is going to pop up

202
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,799
again in my slides but I want you to

203
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,750
remember that on Android auto it

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,330
remembers the temperature where you

205
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,830
plugged in that device so I was actually

206
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,270
driving along and I was wondering I'm

207
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,979
like why isn't it showing us our current

208
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,169
weather it remembers where you plugged

209
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,389
it in so if you needed to say someone

210
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,680
was at a scene when something occurred

211
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,720
where did they start

212
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,789
maybe they fled a place but they plugged

213
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,080
their phone and before they left this is

214
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,630
going to be stored in a file called

215
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,919
cloud cards which is coming up some of

216
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,080
the other files that are interesting

217
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,270
here on the right that's my settings and

218
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,979
I wanted to keep the auto reply but I

219
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,229
had to add

220
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,790
Hank so something to search for because

221
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,350
I need you tidbits to help me get

222
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,300
through this Android so you can see

223
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,610
what's supposed to happen if I'm not

224
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,080
distracted is I'm driving right now Hank

225
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,690
that's the message that anyone that

226
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,579
texted me would get as far as

227
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,580
preferences again they're sprinkled

228
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,250
everywhere everything from first install

229
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,440
and last use dates we can see some of

230
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,429
those are trusted in the Preferences XML

231
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,790
which I'm going to show you

232
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,560
I used Bluetooth primarily I did connect

233
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,420
initially through USB to do the setup

234
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,010
just to look at it but then I did

235
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,420
strictly bluetooth since Sarah was doing

236
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,990
connected so we just had some

237
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,670
differences here last usage date is

238
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,830
going to help us with the distracted

239
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,420
driving and then the common user

240
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,630
settings this is one thing that can be a

241
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,910
little bit confusing so I told my car to

242
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:09,100
always remember it so if you look at the

243
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,680
last date for that it's the last time I

244
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,930
told my car to remember it so it was

245
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,939
really after I first set it up but not

246
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:19,300
when it was last used but here you can

247
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,460
see that I have my Bluetooth a dress for

248
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,189
my Denali that has shown there and that

249
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,780
was the first car I paired with

250
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,050
something that we weren't sure on is

251
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:30,459
where does it track just the last one

252
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,770
used or does it track every single

253
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,090
device that you've connected to and what

254
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,579
I found was weird is when I went into

255
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,100
the Android in the settings it didn't

256
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,220
show my cars but of course the device is

257
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,710
storing it somewhere so now we have the

258
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,540
artifact pollution of Android

259
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,280
it is everywhere I'm sure there are

260
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,500
hundreds of other files that have this

261
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,360
stuff that I just didn't find yet so

262
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,240
what I'm gonna break down here data

263
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,530
usage syncing artifacts that I found

264
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,870
that we're unique and a little bit

265
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,150
strange but it makes sense and then

266
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:03,940
Bluetooth and USB connections so to

267
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,280
start the very first thing were you

268
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,130
connected or not so you can see the very

269
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,829
first time I ran Android auto and the

270
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,890
last time it started monitoring me so we

271
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,620
have two date time stamps here and also

272
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:19,720
you can associate it to my local time or

273
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,020
just keep it in UTC whatever you want to

274
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,430
do now for the permissions I said yes to

275
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,980
everything which I usually do when I'm

276
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,620
doing testing I want everything to be

277
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,010
talking back and forth so I said yes the

278
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,200
con

279
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,670
SMS even on the rental car which you

280
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,370
should never do if it's your real phone

281
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,540
I could assume all of you know that but

282
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,720
what I found interesting here is this

283
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:45,099
people log DB then you'll notice if we

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,050
go actually back a slide I think I can

285
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,250
go back most of these files are in the

286
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:53,050
gear head for Android auto so just

287
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,090
remember gear head is Android auto

288
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,219
itself but some of these others are just

289
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,530
polluted everywhere so this people log

290
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,230
what I found is when I connected to a

291
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,760
new car it needed to do a fresh sync

292
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,080
that took longer because it didn't know

293
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,120
who my contacts were but if you look at

294
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,810
like up here it says it already knows

295
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,880
it's like okay nothing is new so data is

296
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,890
still fresh it will keep looking to see

297
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,200
if you've added a contact now if I do

298
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,090
out of contact how did I add it Android

299
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,030
auto cannot do all that much for you the

300
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,640
best is when Google I say okay Google

301
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,920
and she's like ask what I can do for you

302
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,640
I'm like okay Google what can you do and

303
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,839
she's like I can call someone I can get

304
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:41,590
you directions and there was like and

305
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,330
that's it and back to carplay I go but

306
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,890
there are things that she does that you

307
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,990
don't even realize so she is syncing

308
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,910
contacts if I did out of contact and you

309
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,200
saw that a new contact was synced how

310
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,000
the heck did I do that

311
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,620
I clearly was probably distracted and

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,660
driving or someone was doing it for me

313
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,990
on my device so if you look closely at

314
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:00,430
this file you can definitely break down

315
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,900
what was going on in different cars I

316
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,390
was connected to and then correlate that

317
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,040
to the different cars so the plugging in

318
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,830
is obviously tracked in a file called

319
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,050
power manager and then there's also the

320
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,630
search index database because it needs

321
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,189
to know what can it look up for you so

322
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,880
here we can see in the search index you

323
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,120
should see my Denali and the Nissan

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,110
Sentra now I honestly thought I could

325
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,850
not find the Sentra

326
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,440
because I was searching for Nissan which

327
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,790
drove me crazy until like the final

328
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,660
minutes where I was like oh it's called

329
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,610
my Sentra

330
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,860
so this file actually saved me so this

331
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,810
is a good place to start before you

332
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,110
start digging in all your crazy keyword

333
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,630
searching on the device now something

334
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,790
that Josh mentioned in his paper he was

335
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,550
not able to test multiple

336
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,370
so this is something that was unique it

337
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,260
is tracking every single car you connect

338
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,690
to through bluetooth so here we can see

339
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,930
in this beatty config.xml file on the

340
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,910
Left we have the Bluetooth address for

341
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,219
my Sentra which was my rental car and on

342
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,930
the right we have it for the Denali with

343
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:05,710
the timestamps on when I was actually

344
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:08,589
connected and then where I was when I

345
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,540
connected is in that cloud cards file so

346
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,670
that cloud cards tracks the weather as

347
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,770
soon as you got into your car it

348
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,410
remembered your Bluetooth Android auto

349
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,540
connected and it is permanently there so

350
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,400
it's a good way for you to footprint and

351
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,900
say this is where the user was and it's

352
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,640
just hidden in a blob file in the

353
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,410
database alright so let's get down to

354
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,340
looking at some of the apps so one of

355
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,990
the apps that you're probably going to

356
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,910
interact with most is the messages

357
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,620
application so I use it a lot I don't

358
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,959
actually use the phone part and I don't

359
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,390
call anybody anyway it's a data device

360
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,310
not a phone calling device so I use the

361
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,600
messages application a lot so I mean

362
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,239
there are dictating messages through

363
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,250
Siri or series reading me messages that

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,230
are being sent to my device so kind of

365
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,120
the whole hands-free thing is the whole

366
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,550
dictation and reading of these different

367
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,810
messages so first thing I want to look

368
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,699
at to kind of correlate this and again

369
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,650
this is my Apollo output is looking at

370
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,020
the knowledge see database for evidence

371
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,400
of Siri usage so seriousness does not

372
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,170
necessarily mean it's only through

373
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,840
carplay I can use it on the device

374
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,870
itself but it's the first start to

375
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,670
seeing that kind of evidence so for this

376
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,920
one I'm just looking at the this app

377
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,469
name called comm Apple Siri UI begin

378
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,870
begin and end so I know exactly how long

379
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,520
Siri was being used for now she could be

380
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,320
reading me things I could be dictating

381
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,600
things we don't exactly know the actual

382
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,300
usage of that just yet but it's a good

383
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,850
first start now if I start overlaying

384
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,199
more data on top of that this is where

385
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,880
we get to start seeing some of the

386
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,730
carplay artifacts so right at the top

387
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,530
there I have the carplay connected we

388
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,970
saw that in a previous screenshot but

389
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:42,069
now I start seeing things like what

390
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:43,780
audio is being used so is it using the

391
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,430
microphone maybe I'm dictating something

392
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,740
or is it using the speaker and it's

393
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,209
dictating or telling me a message that I

394
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,180
just received so you can start seeing

395
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:54,040
the audio inputs and outputs for that a

396
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,640
few other things I have highlighted here

397
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,709
are the bundle IDs the different

398
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,120
locations in use so I'm listening to

399
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:01,610
comm Apple music and listening to the

400
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,410
Apple music at this point so when I'm

401
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,140
dictating messages or she's reading them

402
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,790
back to me it's gonna show this flipping

403
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,970
back and forth between the messages

404
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,829
application comm Apple mobile SMS versus

405
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,600
comm Apple music so I'm listening to

406
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,520
music back and forth between these

407
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,070
different messages so you will see that

408
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,410
being changed here now highlighted in

409
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,730
red so the longer highlighted lines

410
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,410
there this is showing me that I'm

411
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,690
sending a message so we're looking at

412
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,770
the interaction see information here

413
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,780
this is gonna give me a little bit more

414
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,819
context if I went further and actually

415
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,949
opened this one up it's storing a plist

416
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,780
file showing me what the message is when

417
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:38,030
I'm actually contacting and all the

418
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,860
contact information associated with that

419
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,730
message sent so I can get more context

420
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,280
and you just don't see it in the

421
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,350
screenshot so a few other things in here

422
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,150
you just see the different interactions

423
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,370
you see the messages so I am parsing out

424
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,709
some of the actual SMS messages from the

425
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,980
SMS DB but once you start overlaying

426
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:56,660
things across multiple databases this is

427
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,700
where the context really helps so it's

428
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,930
good to not just focus on a single

429
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,920
database it's fine

430
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,839
to look at that but just know that

431
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,219
correlation is going to be pretty key

432
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,050
when you're looking at a lot of these

433
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,760
artifacts you can't just look at the SMS

434
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,469
database and say oh that one was

435
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,439
dictated through carplay there is no

436
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,750
flag as far as I know that associates a

437
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,570
specific message being dictated through

438
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,430
Siri so you have to do the correlation

439
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,750
to really figure out were they doing

440
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,160
this through carplay or are they doing

441
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,590
it through the actual messages

442
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,350
application on device you know kind of

443
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:30,470
distracted driving and the androids no

444
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,590
different the SMS database which you can

445
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,380
see here mms SMS DB there is no flag

446
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,960
saying if it was through me texting it

447
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,870
through me using voice the text or me

448
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,400
using okay Google to do this for me but

449
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,770
it's a good place to start so if you

450
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,020
have a time frame in interest you can

451
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,400
obviously go out to your messages

452
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,800
because like Sarah was saying most

453
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,720
people will text while driving that's

454
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,709
obviously known how they did it is where

455
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,380
you're gonna have to piece all of it

456
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,440
together was Android auto in use was it

457
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,910
plugged in if you're plugged in or using

458
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,480
bluetooth it doesn't mean your

459
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,389
hands-free

460
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,760
I had the trick Android auto into not

461
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,829
exiting because every time I tried to go

462
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,898
into a different app that one

463
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,000
to exit and I was like no I want you to

464
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,768
run so I can be distracted driver so I

465
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,140
would have to go into my minimized apps

466
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:19,689
and it sneak into another one so I am

467
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,579
really distracted the good news is I

468
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:23,079
wasn't the one necessarily doing this I

469
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,369
would be lying if I said I didn't do it

470
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,438
a few times I'm like I want to crash

471
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:28,299
this is terrible so I would have someone

472
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:30,730
else driving while I was pretending to

473
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:33,510
be distracted but this is where it's

474
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,399
hard so you can see where I am very

475
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,379
frustrated and the stupid assistant

476
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:40,299
can't do much so I'm texting while

477
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,010
driving clearly in a case he worked no

478
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,260
one's going to write that I assume not

479
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,730
but this is how I do my testing so you

480
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,980
can see I'm actually doing distracted

481
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,260
driving and then I'm doing things

482
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,570
hands-free so I'm actually using this

483
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,850
and then I left Android auto detects

484
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,408
this distracted driving now you can

485
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,350
finally see in here I think where it

486
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,090
says Hank like I'm driving right now

487
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,059
Hank sorry I hit you with the laser

488
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,490
while you're drawing but you can see

489
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,840
that I actually that message was sent

490
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,960
out too and this is all from the wall

491
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,760
file and then did you read this while it

492
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,059
says whole driving because things aren't

493
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,340
going well I am talking to myself at

494
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,779
this point while driving and I shouldn't

495
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,490
have been so it's like I should just

496
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:23,940
calm down and stop this but you can see

497
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,880
it's all there and like Sarah was saying

498
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,850
you will see where I then leave and I go

499
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,370
into whatsapp so the final thing I did

500
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,100
here was I actually asked the device to

501
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:40,120
send Hank a message through whatsapp so

502
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,379
it's all over the place it is you need

503
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,389
to find a starting point that makes

504
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,820
sense to you and use that as your anchor

505
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:48,100
and then just spread from there so

506
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,809
really a timeline and any of the tools

507
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,399
will probably be the most helpful but

508
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,200
the tools aren't going to timeline all

509
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:55,120
these artifacts are not parsing so it's

510
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,570
going to be more manual on your part

511
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,340
from that point alright so getting back

512
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,320
to some of the application usage so I

513
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,389
wanted to show kind of some examples of

514
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,010
doing application usage through the

515
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:08,289
carplay application itself or through

516
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,000
the carplay interface itself versus me

517
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:11,529
on the phone distracted driving maybe

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,850
sending a message or it's something like

519
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:15,039
that so I want to show the differences

520
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,629
between that so a couple of different

521
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,789
examples up here and I filtered this

522
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,320
down because I need you to look at other

523
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:21,549
databases so I'm basically

524
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,740
filtering it down to the knowledge see

525
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:25,809
database and overlaying that would be

526
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,970
cash encrypted see database so the ones

527
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,820
that are labeled motion this is cash

528
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,960
encrypted see this is keeping track of

529
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,970
certain things like are you on a bike

530
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,710
are you in a car are you moving are you

531
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,570
not moving things like that so that is

532
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,009
kind of a good indicator and it's

533
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,110
actually fairly accurate from the the

534
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,120
research that I've done to say is this

535
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:44,379
person actually in the car or not and

536
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,299
you don't have to be plugged in it has

537
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,340
nothing to do with being plugged in it's

538
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:50,980
the motion of the device itself it just

539
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:52,809
knows that you are in a car and if you

540
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,759
are moving or not so it is pretty darn

541
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:57,009
accurate so taking a look at the motion

542
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,509
there I have some items that are

543
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:01,509
highlighted at the end of the screenshot

544
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:03,340
is in vehicle is moving or not so the

545
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:06,129
first one I'm in the vehicle I am moving

546
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,689
the last one is in the vehicle but not

547
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:09,879
moving so maybe I'm stopped at a light

548
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,320
or something like that now the two

549
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:14,110
different applications that I'm using

550
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,029
here we got comm a puppet cast which is

551
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,250
a car play application I want to listen

552
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:20,379
to some podcasts and then order that

553
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,330
whisper systems that signal so this is

554
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:24,519
the signal application signal does not

555
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,408
have power play support so I have two

556
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,330
different applications that I want to

557
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:30,519
take a look at now if I start overlaying

558
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,439
more data I can see if I'm actually

559
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,289
going to be distracted or not while

560
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,269
using the signal application so a lot of

561
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,820
the location stuff is also being tracked

562
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:42,940
very very granular location

563
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,918
awesome awesome forensics data so this

564
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,509
one is keeping track of this speed that

565
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:48,820
I'm going so the items that are

566
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,580
highlighted in red here is keeping track

567
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,710
of my speed and meters per second so I'm

568
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,840
not going very fast and you can see that

569
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,809
in that association there but I'm

570
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,580
basically slowing down I use comm Apple

571
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:03,100
podcast so maybe I'm switching from

572
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,470
Apple music to podcast I wanna listen to

573
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,959
something different and my meters per

574
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,879
second in the middle there is zero so

575
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,320
I'm stopped so if you actually look at

576
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:12,480
that location you got the coordinates

577
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,129
there if you want to plug those into

578
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,269
whatever map application you like you're

579
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:17,860
going to see that I'm stopped at an

580
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,450
intersection so you can say I'm probably

581
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,059
stopped at a stoplight at this

582
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,830
particular time so at the stoplight

583
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,110
I open up the signal application so I

584
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,879
take out my device I get through the car

585
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,620
play interface but I want to check my

586
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,570
signal messages so we can see that

587
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,040
interaction there now if the meters per

588
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,960
second before or after that

589
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,310
is you know well I don't know what a

590
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,260
crazy distance in meters per second is

591
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,179
but say 50 or something yeah I'm

592
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,550
probably using the application while I'm

593
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,110
driving or somebody in the car is using

594
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,810
the application you don't necessarily

595
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,469
know if it's the driver or the passenger

596
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:51,250
that's something that were you're not

597
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:53,770
going to see within the data so using

598
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,690
signal here I'm at a stoplight it's zero

599
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,770
meters per second and it is pretty darn

600
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,800
accurate for that particular speed now

601
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,510
the third one that I have listed here

602
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,690
right at the bottom so calm apple core

603
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,760
off UI so this one if you've ever used

604
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,010
Cigna before you can have it associated

605
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,200
with face ID so I actually have to look

606
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,420
at my phone and see yep

607
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,700
it sees my face it'll open up and I can

608
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,350
see all my signal messages in there so

609
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,650
you'll find different applications have

610
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,020
different face ID authentication if you

611
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,400
will so now you're driving distracted so

612
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,129
yes I'm driving distracted because I'm

613
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,320
literally have to look at my phone to

614
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,790
open up the signal application but you

615
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,560
can see with the location that my speed

616
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:38,020
is zero so with theoretically I'm

617
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,780
stopped at this particular moment in

618
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,980
time so I had to include this one Sarah

619
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,120
and I were torn on do we want to show

620
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:48,160
maps or not but she kept listening and

621
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,929
tracking what I was saying so I get very

622
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,850
frustrated during my testing and talk

623
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,370
back and you could see that in yellow

624
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,409
down there serious faster than you so

625
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,750
she wasn't responding to me I'm like ok

626
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,490
doubel do this and I'm so used to in-car

627
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,320
play where I say take me to the d4

628
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,930
summit and she said headed to the d4

629
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,929
summit Thank You Siri so I'm asking him

630
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:10,930
like are we are we actually going

631
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,760
anywhere no response Mike and then she's

632
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,490
she's tracking me saying are we on our

633
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,560
way to celebrate in Tyson's Corner and

634
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,360
it should have been celebrate and then I

635
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,220
respond so I'm like right

636
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,090
Siri so much faster because I just see

637
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,690
this spinning nothing of the voice which

638
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,070
it's crazy if you heard even what Alexa

639
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,110
captures on me when I'm like talking

640
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,879
back to it and yelling and usually I'm

641
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,770
like thank you and I'll apologize my

642
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,250
son's like shut up I'm like okay or that

643
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:41,830
very helpful but it is all tracked so

644
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,570
there are these session files that you

645
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,159
can just go into and you can see every

646
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,429
single thing just like the users typing

647
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,410
some

648
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,860
into Google it's all track there which

649
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:53,320
was pretty useful and helpful now where

650
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,060
this becomes a giant nightmare and when

651
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,470
Sarah and I first put these slides

652
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,570
together and then she saw it she's like

653
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,980
oh my gosh it slides out of control that

654
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,850
is how it's going to feel in your

655
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,980
examination so you will see that data is

656
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,080
everywhere and you need to put it

657
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:12,810
together to say was I distracted or not

658
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,659
so we're back to that SMS message so if

659
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,340
7:16 around that time is of interest to

660
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,650
you this is where you can see where I

661
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,850
admit because I put it in the text

662
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,190
message which again no one probably

663
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:26,649
would do this said I set it up while

664
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,440
distracted driving but then I actually

665
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,990
say I'm now hand three I did make a call

666
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,670
and I did that through Google Voice but

667
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,680
it's hard for you to know that if you

668
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,430
don't go back and find those files where

669
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,260
I say call Hank I also on the left here

670
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:44,380
so if we're starting this is a pro to

671
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,120
buff file these binary PD and you can

672
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,370
parse them but parsing it didn't make it

673
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:52,060
look all that much better so I just left

674
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:54,850
it in hex so I asked Google to text Hank

675
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,310
and she asked which one there's two of

676
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:00,610
them Hank fresh and Hank freshman and I

677
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,590
said Hank freshman but then I tell her I

678
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,560
want you to text Hank freshman through

679
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:07,090
whatsapp so she tracks all of this in

680
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,100
the right of head log so she has the

681
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,780
message before it even hit my whatsapp

682
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,659
database so if you're dealing with a

683
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,790
whatsapp device it's encrypted

684
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:19,930
Google is going to keep it in the right

685
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:22,930
ahead log for the SMS the MMS SMS DB as

686
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:25,270
a second copy so you could also find it

687
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,580
there but then what's interesting as I'm

688
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,440
time lining in my tool I see that

689
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,740
screenshot right there so apparently

690
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,140
whatsapp crashed at some point and when

691
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,090
it crashed a all smartphones take

692
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,640
snapshots of what's going on on the

693
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,889
device and I was able to recover that so

694
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,140
clearly when that occurred if that

695
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,300
what's up message still went through or

696
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,360
if I clicked ok if you can find that

697
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,669
interaction that would possibly help you

698
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,320
when we look at created date time stamps

699
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:55,060
of these files in these pictures this is

700
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,429
where you're like I don't know really

701
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,658
what is happening it is going to be very

702
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,629
difficult for you to

703
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:03,580
say 100% that I was not doing this

704
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:05,529
distracted because I was connected to

705
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,349
bluetooth you do see Google Voice

706
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:10,149
interaction it would be easier if I told

707
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:12,129
you someone was in the car with me who

708
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:14,320
is actually doing the typing and the

709
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:16,539
talking but you don't really know that

710
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,210
necessarily when it's a he said she said

711
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:21,849
type accident or a fatality or something

712
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,649
you're working so it there's not an easy

713
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,090
way right now for you to say oh this is

714
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:27,158
amazing and it's so easy and here are

715
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,709
all the answers that's the bad news

716
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,519
but these protobuf files are really

717
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:32,889
really helpful

718
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,419
you can also carve out all of the Google

719
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:35,918
Voice files and listen to them and

720
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:37,599
that's something that is in Josh's paper

721
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,799
that will highlight for you at the end

722
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,178
so I didn't bother doing that because

723
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,690
he's already done a brilliant job with

724
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,419
it so it's both versions of the Android

725
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:50,109
way that Google search box is storing

726
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:51,580
that for you all right so like Heather

727
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,470
mentioned we do want to give a special

728
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,478
shout out to Josh Hickman he's written a

729
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,700
bunch of great blog articles on both

730
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:59,889
carplay as well as Android auto and we

731
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,539
specifically did a lot of artifacts in

732
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,820
this that were presented in those who

733
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:05,590
you know not to overtake what Josh has

734
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,789
already put out there so we really

735
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,678
recommend if you're interested in this

736
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:10,210
stuff too absolutely take a look at his

737
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,710
blog articles they're great they're

738
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,299
lengthy they got a lot of screenshots

739
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,590
there is some great information and

740
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,389
their stuff that we can't cover in a

741
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:18,789
short presentation like this but there

742
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:20,529
are a fantastic artifacts out there as

743
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:24,158
we give you a couple links here but just

744
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:28,239
do a search for the binary hick and look

745
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,599
for either carplay or Android auto as

746
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:34,389
far as what's next so obviously lots

747
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,789
more research I want to dig into the j7

748
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:38,709
device I don't have time for when I do

749
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:43,960
that I will definitely write blog about

750
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:46,720
it and maybe maybe Android modules for

751
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,820
Apollo it's not just an apple thing it's

752
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,109
just a sequel light thing so if you have

753
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,330
sequel ID databases you want to write

754
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:55,090
modules I'm happy to accept them into

755
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,710
the the code repository it's mostly just

756
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,769
my project right now but it's available

757
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,330
to everybody to hopefully add some stuff

758
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:03,279
in there so it's just a bunch of great

759
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,080
sequel queries I say great because I

760
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,389
wrote them but there's a bunch of

761
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,060
queries that can be very very useful in

762
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:09,560
a variety

763
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,030
different investigations so certainly

764
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,580
take a look at that if you get a chance

765
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:17,540
and very happy to see contributions to

766
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:19,790
it if you like this certainly take a

767
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,230
look at some of our other research that

768
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,700
we put out there I know Heather and I we

769
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,020
both have our own blogs we'd like to

770
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,970
throw some stuff out there we like to

771
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,530
present in other places so take a look

772
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:30,640
at our blogs hers as smart forensics

773
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,320
Minds Mac forensics for n6 get it yeah

774
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,790
certainly take a look at our classes too

775
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,980
I know a lot of students are going to be

776
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,240
here or a previous students so we do

777
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,910
like to talk about this sometimes in our

778
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,950
classes we can't get super in-depth into

779
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,600
our a lot of our data but we really do

780
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,550
like to put our information out there

781
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,740
and we certainly do a lot of webcasts as

782
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,320
well for a variety of different means

783
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:54,020
the best way to reach us that we both

784
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,460
prefer is through Twitter or in the

785
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,530
hallway here something I know we're

786
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,870
running tight on time for lunch so we

787
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,940
may keep questions somewhat to a minimum

788
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,699
if there's a lot but we're around you

789
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,990
can find us here all week well thank you

790
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,990
I hope everybody has a great lunch

791
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:18,990
[Applause]

792
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,990
[Music]

793
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,960
you
