1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,179
presentation awesome so this is crisis

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,379
communications for incident response

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:12,120
I'll talk a little bit about that means

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,540
in a second but first I have to do the

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,948
obligatory this is a picture of me I'm

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,580
an advanced persistent incident

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,510
responder at github does anybody know

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,859
github heard about it okay great so

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,560
we're a t-shirt and sticker company

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,970
we're getting into get hosting we think

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,210
the git hosting thing might work out for

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,399
us but we're not sure because I saw sans

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,469
was cool and had a Twitter account and a

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,950
hashtag I decided to do the same thing

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,520
so if you want to tweet at me you can

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,770
use CCIR

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,730
and I should be upfront but I'm not an

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,890
expert in this

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,629
I do Incident Response most the time I

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,149
don't actually write a lot of public

21
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,099
statements but I came across this and

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,570
thought it was an interesting topic and

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,750
it turns out I know a bunch of people

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,969
who do this type of work I turn out have

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,129
a bunch of friends who are all in either

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,380
public relations and a number of people

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,619
at github who came out of basically

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,780
doing crisis communications for public

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,110
scandals publicity problems things like

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,720
that so I consulted them but this all

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,780
started with a blog post back in

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,080
September actually and I was reading

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,850
through Krebs and I came across an

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,679
interesting article and I went to my

35
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,780
boss and I said this is a great example

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,689
of how an incident can be done really

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:41,880
really well so does anybody remember the

38
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:45,119
big incident from September 2014 okay PF

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,250
Changs got hacked I know everyone's

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:54,420
devastated PF Changs got had a credit

41
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,640
card breach and came out and published a

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,680
bunch of stuff about it and it turns out

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,420
it wasn't a story almost no one knows

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,729
what happened Brian Krebs posted two

45
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,640
things about it the public didn't really

46
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,439
get into it and it turns out that's

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,560
because they did a really good job of

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,799
talking about what happened and so I

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,640
thought I wonder if anybody's

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,930
looking into this and no one really was

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,940
and what it was was a good example of

52
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,160
crisis communications so I thought maybe

53
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,890
I should share some of what I learned so

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,270
what is crisis communications and I did

55
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,029
what everybody does and I immediately

56
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,860
looked on Wikipedia and according to

57
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,260
Wikipedia it's a subspecialty of the

58
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,700
public relations feel profession that is

59
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,840
designed to protect and defend an

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,290
individual company organization facing a

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,180
public challenge to its reputation

62
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,850
pretty simple but I need simpler than

63
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,230
that that's that's still a lot so it's

64
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,230
what happens when everything goes wrong

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,990
so then you need to define ok what

66
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,720
what's going wrong well if you're a real

67
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:02,060
public relations person it could be a

68
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,520
celebrity scandal it could be a company

69
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,800
health issue things like that but for us

70
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,580
it comes down to three technically four

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,520
major things you could have a breach

72
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,300
where you're actually dealing with a

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,470
confidentiality or integrity failure

74
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,400
generally resulting from someone getting

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,230
into your network you could have a

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,420
vulnerability and this is one that

77
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,549
wasn't immediately apparent to me but

78
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,380
you often have to do crisis

79
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,090
communications when something comes out

80
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,320
where there's a vulnerability in your

81
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,820
system especially in the case where a

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,100
the user has to do something in order to

83
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,350
help you fix it should I be standing up

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,769
here was just better feels weirdly

85
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:51,290
pretentious it also kind of feels like

86
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm on a rave so I don't know given I

87
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,340
work at github I can't not talk about

88
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,870
the fact that you you do also have to do

89
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,600
crisis communications in the event of a

90
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,390
DDoS which is a failure of availability

91
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,600
so I've covered all the parts of the CIA

92
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,950
triangle I think I'm good in case you

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,310
don't know what a DDoS looks like this

94
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:15,310
is in fact what they look like really

95
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,630
okay thank you

96
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,269
the other time you end up having to do

97
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,520
crisis communications is frankly for not

98
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,620
one of these things there are a number

99
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,159
of cases where someone basically has a

100
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,550
rumor they've been compromised

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,370
or a rumor they're knocked offline for a

102
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:37,800
DDoS and you have to come up and say no

103
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:39,150
here's what the actual story is so okay

104
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,500
you're all convinced we all need to know

105
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,570
about this we all need to be doing this

106
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,640
better is anybody gonna argue with me

107
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:47,760
right off the bat that we're doing this

108
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,250
really really well because I'll point

109
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,420
you at United right now and ask you if

110
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,330
you think we're doing this really really

111
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,710
well for those of you who don't know I

112
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:00,780
hope you're not flying United tonight

113
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,010
because you're not flying out so I asked

114
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,799
a bunch of people who do public

115
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,590
relations what are the five keys for

116
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,490
good crisis communications and and

117
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:13,049
they're that here are the things they

118
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,940
gave me the first one is to be clear if

119
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,070
the people you're talking with don't

120
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,780
understand your message you won't be

121
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,040
able to get it across and they won't

122
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,169
know what they're what they're really

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,250
trying to deal with

124
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,060
sorry unfortunately notes aren't up here

125
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,460
so it's really throwing me off so we all

126
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,750
investigate intrusions no one would say

127
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,590
that's an easy job

128
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,810
and it's hard to explain that job on top

129
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,750
of it you know even when we're talking

130
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,130
with other intrusion teams you're still

131
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,760
trying to deal with the fact that that

132
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,960
these are complicated issues but what

133
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,430
what about when you're talking to folks

134
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,440
who aren't technical folks who don't

135
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,000
understand the lingo you're using or

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,030
people who are only semi technical what

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,550
if you're talking with your CFO who

138
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,289
doesn't understand what O'Day's and

139
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:02,430
forensic analysis and all those things

140
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,460
are the way we get around this according

141
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,390
to the public relations specialists is

142
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,669
everything should be on a fifth grade

143
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,919
reading level

144
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,030
so my wife's an education or not and I

145
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,540
asked what is a fifth grade reading

146
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,369
level

147
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,780
turns out there's no technical

148
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,720
definition of what a fifth grade reading

149
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,940
level is so her exact words were well

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,750
it's it's basically like the first two

151
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:28,890
Harry Potter books not the later ones

152
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,940
where they get scary but that's what

153
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,590
we're aiming for and and this probably

154
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,450
is the one slide that you should take

155
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,198
away from this whole talk if you only

156
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:42,090
remember one thing without understanding

157
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,760
with without a clear message of what's

158
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,150
going on victims will remain confused

159
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,190
and critics will be skeptical no one

160
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,989
wants to be running the incident that

161
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,630
has everyone in the security community

162
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,250
writing a blog post telling you how your

163
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:01,229
details are actually just a little bit

164
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:03,690
off and you just don't know and clarity

165
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,990
is about not not just about one message

166
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,580
but about multiple messages so in

167
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,460
today's age one of the things that the

168
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,349
the PR folks I talked to made a big

169
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,000
point of is something that's different

170
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,750
is in the 80s you put out a press

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,919
statement and that was it and now part

172
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,900
of the thing that's made that field so

173
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,630
complicated is you're running a website

174
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,760
putting out press statements going on

175
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:31,169
Twitter interacting with people on

176
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,150
snapchat it goes on and on and on and so

177
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:36,510
the ability to be clear the ability to

178
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:39,060
get your message across consistently has

179
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,840
to go across multiple mediums and across

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:47,039
multiple messages I have a couple little

181
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,789
asides one of them attribution doesn't

182
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,349
actually help clear up your your nobody

183
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:59,010
notice the equation Brian Williams

184
00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:00,930
behind it too subtle am I gonna have to

185
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:05,760
explain the jokes is this is this what

186
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:09,419
we're doing um he was with the NSA that

187
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,530
was true one of the things people do

188
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,240
when they're trying to put out a message

189
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,388
that they think is going to help is talk

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,099
about things like attribution I'm not

191
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,720
gonna get into an attribution debate I

192
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,860
think attribution is really important

193
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,710
for a lot of the technical

194
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,410
investigations but it turns out CNN

195
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:29,638
doesn't actually care whether it was a

196
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:33,270
PT one hyper Falcon Vegas it just

197
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,529
muddies your message another thing to

198
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,348
think about what it talks about when

199
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:41,779
we're talking about clarity who has seen

200
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:44,730
an intrusion by an advanced actor um

201
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,790
these are a series of words that we at

202
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,980
github have banned from putting in our

203
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,050
incident communications because they

204
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,710
don't tell anybody anything

205
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,760
don't use nation state you

206
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,350
probably don't have good enough

207
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,630
attribution to know whether it really is

208
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,920
a nation-state or not and you look a lot

209
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,100
Dumber when you find out it's a bunch of

210
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,349
kids in their basement don't use the

211
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,330
word unusual you wouldn't be reporting

212
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,310
on it if it wasn't unusual it turns out

213
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,960
that's a big deal and advanced

214
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,900
persistent and sophisticated or just

215
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,700
abusive I want someone to come out and

216
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,000
admit to being hacked by a basic dumb

217
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,810
lazy actor I think that would actually

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,580
be really interesting and so I include a

219
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,729
bunch of quotes from people who know a

220
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,530
lot more about public relations than I

221
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,210
do and I thought this one was

222
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,270
particularly good when it comes to

223
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,280
clarity because you don't really know

224
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:39,640
what part of your message is going to be

225
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,230
picked up and become newsworthy so it's

226
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:48,000
really important to think through what

227
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:50,680
you're saying so cool be clear be timely

228
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
this by the way is the hardest one of

229
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,370
these five things for what we're talking

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,630
about and it's the one that you most

231
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:02,650
consistently see vendors make mistakes

232
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:05,620
on so if you communicate about a breach

233
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,000
or a DDoS or something too early you

234
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,740
have to make a lot of follow-ups

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,220
you look like you don't actually know

236
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,630
what's going on we're gonna talk about

237
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,750
some examples of some people who made

238
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,520
this mistake a little bit later but if

239
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,890
you communicate too late your warnings

240
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,329
not actionable and you end up seeming

241
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,939
like you're out of control and don't

242
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,710
know what's going on so so that's a

243
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,320
really bad place to be if we're too

244
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,910
early we look like you know we made a

245
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,340
bunch of mistakes if we're too late we

246
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,850
looked at Livius so you really have to

247
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,550
walk that line the best option seems to

248
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,000
be over communicating and and assuming

249
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,790
the worst because I would much rather

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,590
say the first phrase than to say the

251
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,870
second phrase something I do have to

252
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,180
bring up in this case is there are when

253
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,550
it comes to timeliness a lot of

254
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,189
industries have their hands tied so if

255
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,240
you're under any of those acronyms that

256
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,360
I'm really glad I don't have to deal

257
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,460
with a lot they're going to hold you to

258
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,660
the your feet to the fire on you can

259
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,000
wait 30 days you can

260
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,430
ninety days I don't know if there any

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,520
are there any shorter reach notification

262
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:20,170
timeframes and this was I thought a

263
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,840
great quote the secret of crisis

264
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,969
management is not good versus bad its

265
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,380
preventing bad from getting worse and so

266
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,300
when you're thinking through your timing

267
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,850
it's important to note you can't

268
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,109
actually make a problem go away your

269
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:37,900
goal is to help people protect

270
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:39,640
themselves uh okay I'm trying to be

271
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,050
interactive and know that you guys are

272
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,480
really quiet you didn't have your coffee

273
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:48,430
this morning huh I'm on like three cups

274
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,740
it's great so so that leads into the

275
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,030
idea of being actionable so the whole

276
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,700
point of breach communications is you're

277
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,949
trying to tell your your victims what

278
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:00,520
they need to understand to protect

279
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,900
themselves further and so that comes

280
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,670
down to what you're doing and what

281
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,890
they're doing so first of all you need

282
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,209
to tell users what they can do to

283
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,949
mitigate or what you're doing to

284
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,130
mitigate the problem you're dealing with

285
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:16,420
so if it's a breach you need to say

286
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:18,460
we've you know we've worked to lock this

287
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,390
at the firewall what whatever you need

288
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,220
to tell them what you're doing in the

289
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,280
short term to prevent a problem from

290
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,360
getting worse you need to tell them what

291
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,829
you're doing to remediate the problem

292
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,780
what are you doing to make it better in

293
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,820
the long term this one is really

294
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,290
important and it's it's not always done

295
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,670
very well you need to let people know

296
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,469
how they can identify if they're

297
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,719
affected by the problem you're dealing

298
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,370
with so if it's a breach you need to let

299
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,500
them know if it was their email address

300
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,750
and their email account that was was

301
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,830
taken or if they don't have anything to

302
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,600
worry about you need to say what you're

303
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,360
doing to protect organizations or

304
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,340
protect users in this case it's almost

305
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
always just credit monitoring does

306
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,860
anybody in the room not have credit

307
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:07,360
monitoring from like three different

308
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:09,280
people you're on three I am to OPM

309
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,529
anthem and I don't know if somebody else

310
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,129
got hacked

311
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:17,689
basically everyone it's great and going

312
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,220
along with that you need to tell users

313
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:21,529
what they can do to protect themselves

314
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,480
is it important to change passwords is

315
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:26,629
it important to role authentication

316
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:30,980
tokens is it important to patch your

317
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:33,170
system being actionable is a combination

318
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,999
and it's really important to also focus

319
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,839
on what people can do to protect

320
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:41,749
themselves and I thought this quote from

321
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,429
John rockefeller was fantastic next to

322
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:44,899
doing the right thing the most important

323
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:47,629
thing is to let people know you're doing

324
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:49,490
the right thing and that's all about

325
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,649
communicating actionability I mean being

326
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,990
able to say on the backend we were doing

327
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,730
you know we did thousands of hours worth

328
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,269
of work to make sure this breach doesn't

329
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,869
happen again

330
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:00,949
is a great thing and you need to do it

331
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:02,600
but it's also a good idea to make sure

332
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,459
your users know that you did the same

333
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,619
thing because that inspires confidence

334
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:13,729
and makes them feel good about coming

335
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:16,519
back being responsible and and this one

336
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,899
does get a little scary and is this

337
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,249
one's interesting because there's a lot

338
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:23,119
of work coming out of this from medical

339
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:24,829
field and so the 70's and 80's you might

340
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,319
know we're a very litigious point for

341
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:28,729
the medical field in the United States

342
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:31,639
everyone was suing everyone everyone was

343
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,829
in trouble for everything and in about I

344
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,679
think it was 2012 a group of doctors in

345
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,989
Minneapolis had a weird idea let's stop

346
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,559
worrying about getting sued and let's

347
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:45,709
tell people we're sorry and that was a

348
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:47,420
really risky thing on their part but it

349
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,549
turns out admitting what went wrong and

350
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,849
saying you're sorry actually does a lot

351
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:57,110
to help your own case as the people at

352
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,790
fault because by being empathetic by by

353
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,670
being somebody that people can

354
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:05,240
understand you go from a huge mega Corp

355
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:09,349
to you know terrible blunder to a couple

356
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,240
people having a bad day and so it's a

357
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,429
really fine line to walk again but

358
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,160
there's an incredible amount of power to

359
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,610
being upfront and admitting we made a

360
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,850
mistake

361
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,470
we're sorry we're trying to fix it but

362
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,070
because you are opening yourself up to a

363
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,920
certain amount

364
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:31,520
of responsibility it takes some

365
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,199
collaboration and so not just your

366
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,079
security team you're gonna have to work

367
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,300
with the public relations team this is a

368
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,220
little aside I got to write my first

369
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,260
post-mortem when I was at github and I

370
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,920
had I brought in a lot of these lessons

371
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,810
even then and so we had a very minor

372
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,579
security thing that I had to work

373
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:55,069
through and my post was like I am so

374
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,230
sorry we failed you as a as an

375
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,540
organization and everything's terrible

376
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,940
and I'm gonna never work in security

377
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,550
again and I had to get dialed back by

378
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,850
our public relations team because it

379
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,579
wasn't that big a deal but but that's

380
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,920
the power of working with other teams to

381
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:16,220
understand how to put out one of these

382
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,810
messages customer support also an

383
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,510
important one we learned very quickly

384
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,910
that anything we said publicly as far as

385
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:26,180
statements crisis communications things

386
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,040
like that resulted in a ton of email to

387
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,800
our community our customer support team

388
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:36,260
so having them in the loop early made a

389
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,569
really big difference being responsible

390
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,689
often involves bringing in third parties

391
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,520
to help you work a breach I've worked at

392
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,690
one of them it's a good thing I'm not

393
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,250
busting on those but people love vendor

394
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,370
name-dropping in their crisis

395
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:56,120
communications and coming out and saying

396
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,830
like oh we brought in X team doesn't

397
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,810
actually help outside of the security

398
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:04,040
community but people love doing it so

399
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,290
something I really recommend avoiding

400
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,180
because in a very small group it makes a

401
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,569
difference but overall to the public it

402
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:13,520
doesn't I thought this would kill this

403
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:19,609
was a good this is a good jiff this is a

404
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:21,619
good jiff guys are tough so when it

405
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,948
comes to taking responsibility I chose a

406
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:27,679
quote from Mark Twain in his typical

407
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,420
tongue-in-cheek kind of way acknowledge

408
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,070
fault frankly this will throw those in

409
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,260
authority off their guard and give you

410
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:37,639
the opportunity to commit more and going

411
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,200
along with responsibility is the idea of

412
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,659
being human

413
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,879
it's it's incredibly easy to want to

414
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,230
hide behind a wall of legalese to want

415
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,539
to hide behind a bunch of prepared

416
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,970
statements and things like that but but

417
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:53,240
again you're trying to get people to

418
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,820
understand that you're a group of humans

419
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:59,659
who have are having a bad day and that

420
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:03,668
empathy is really powerful so it's

421
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:06,399
important to learn how to sound human

422
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:09,710
this is a tough crowd

423
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:14,658
Rob Sam CGI was a lot easier they

424
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,639
laughed a lot more it that's all that's

425
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,799
true okay

426
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:20,479
well Arnold here will tell you that in

427
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,299
order to sound human when it comes to

428
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,429
crisis communications going through a

429
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:28,158
single person makes a big difference

430
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:31,970
text built by committee tends to sound

431
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:35,509
like text built by committee you want to

432
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,429
avoid legal terms jargon you know this

433
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:40,039
goes back to that list of bad words like

434
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:41,830
don't say zero day we can't agree what

435
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,240
that means inside the security community

436
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,350
we can't assume anybody outside it has

437
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,700
any idea I tend to do a thing where I'll

438
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,928
say something I'll say what I want to

439
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,600
say I'll write it down

440
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:56,240
I'll read it back to myself and then I

441
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,619
read it out loud because I do things

442
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,990
like forgetting words and stuff like

443
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:05,059
that and then get a lot of feedback but

444
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,889
more moving one word versus another not

445
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:09,590
so much you know reworking the entire

446
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:13,639
text forty times until it sounds like

447
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,220
you know it was computer-generated so so

448
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:18,908
those are the five big things does

449
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,909
anybody remember them all

450
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:33,169
there you go it still counts be clear be

451
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:35,570
timely the actionable be responsible be

452
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,970
human if you can do those five things

453
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,259
this is going to be pretty easy

454
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,539
something else to keep in mind though is

455
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,220
your audience because while those five

456
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:44,840
things stay true no matter who your

457
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,580
audience is you do have to make certain

458
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,500
adjustments based on who the audience is

459
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,639
so external most of what we've been

460
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,260
talking about is

461
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,920
is pretty much aimed at external

462
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,900
communication making press releases

463
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,320
putting stuff out on social media all of

464
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:05,270
that but you also have to consider

465
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,620
talking to executives if you're the

466
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,210
security team and you're having a

467
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,860
security incident chances are you're

468
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,200
gonna get dragged into a room with you

469
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:14,330
know the four or five scariest people at

470
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,030
your company and they're gonna want you

471
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:21,290
to explain what on earth's going on the

472
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:23,180
one thing in my personal experience this

473
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,100
is not the time to fight for budget I

474
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,290
feel like a lot of people love doing

475
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,620
that of you know massive security

476
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,300
incident clearly we need to go by shiny

477
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,820
$400,000 1u box that I've always wanted

478
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:37,700
but haven't gotten to get for Christmas

479
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,010
and I really recommend avoiding that

480
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,150
it's it's incredibly important to make

481
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,670
sure that your executive team

482
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:47,740
understands what you're dealing with in

483
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:52,520
the moment and the time to go shopping

484
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:54,830
generally comes later a lot of people

485
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,330
often forget about internal

486
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,770
communication when it comes to incidents

487
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,770
and this this has been important to us

488
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:03,470
at github on a number of occasions if

489
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:06,310
employees don't have a message about

490
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,140
what's going on they'll invent one and

491
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,720
that might mean poking around in files

492
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,120
they're not supposed to that might mean

493
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,250
the rumor mill starts going like crazy

494
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,409
it might mean people just start making

495
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,850
things up because they don't want to sit

496
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,930
at Thanksgiving dinner and look like

497
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,260
they don't know what's going on in their

498
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:26,330
own company so so one of the things we

499
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,940
find is really important is we have to

500
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,310
give a message to our users and that

501
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:35,390
message can even be here's what's going

502
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:37,460
on please don't say anything and that is

503
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:41,350
a whole lot better than sharing nothing

504
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,630
and expecting they won't share anything

505
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,000
and the last kind of audience that you

506
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,760
have to talk about in all this is is

507
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,280
intelligence sharing and I know a lot of

508
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,660
people are probably there's not a lot of

509
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,980
intelligence sharing talks here I'm kind

510
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,660
of surprised but it's become a big thing

511
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,960
to share within industry verticals

512
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,730
within me frankly friend groups all

513
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,620
kinds of things and you really need to

514
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,000
think about how you want to share

515
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,350
information about the incident you're

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,610
dealing with to those types of groups

517
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,260
setting up rules of engagement ahead of

518
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,760
time you know what you're allowed to say

519
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:21,860
who you're allowed to say it to what the

520
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:24,710
timing is makes a big difference that's

521
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,419
actually the background is from Tinker

522
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,040
Tailor Soldier Spy which I thought was

523
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:35,980
good for Intel sharing but it doesn't

524
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:38,090
really show up oh come on I don't know

525
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,040
and the point of understanding your

526
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,860
audience is really if you don't tell

527
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,629
your story someone else will and the

528
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,919
whole point of this is you want to get

529
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,440
to the point where you're the ones we're

530
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:54,230
controlling the flow of information not

531
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:56,809
your employees not Brian Krebs we refer

532
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,540
to getting Krebs as a verb in my

533
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:03,110
organization and no one wants to get

534
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,270
crabs so it's important to think about

535
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,750
what your medium is for how you're doing

536
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:10,280
these communications the web is the best

537
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,630
I'm going to go through a couple

538
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,300
examples of people who did this well

539
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,590
people who did this poorly and the ones

540
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,290
who have done this really really well

541
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,959
can all point to one website and go

542
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:24,080
here's all the information about what

543
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,730
we're dealing with in the case where

544
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,879
they have to send out things in another

545
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,830
medium it's almost always copied

546
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,370
straight from that website and linked

547
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:36,949
back to that website best thing you can

548
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,719
do is have a plan for putting incident

549
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,510
details putting your breach notification

550
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,650
in one place on the web and just linking

551
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:54,860
everybody else to that email is also

552
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:56,120
important oh sure if your users have

553
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,689
stopped clicking on links and emails

554
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,919
you're doing better than I am I've been

555
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,330
telling them not to for years and it

556
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,679
still keeps happening so the the point

557
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,409
is people are going to follow what they

558
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,570
believe are our legitimate links now I

559
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,130
think that one of the best ways to

560
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,950
address that is that link should be

561
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,200
going somewhere one transparently so

562
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,390
don't use a crazy redirect that you know

563
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,640
makes it those shorteners are

564
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,280
but they make everything look shady as

565
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,220
can be and to put it somewhere that

566
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,990
people can feel confident in so one of

567
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,700
the better examples we have later posted

568
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,340
all their instant details to a tumblr

569
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,200
and it turns out

570
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,000
tumblr is known for being kind of weird

571
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,730
and Shady sometimes but generally not in

572
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,290
terms of whether it's hosting bad things

573
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,020
or a phishing site or anything like that

574
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:49,730
more just in terms of you know 15

575
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:51,980
year-olds artwork so pointing people at

576
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:56,300
a known place you know we point people

577
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:58,400
at blog github.com at the point where

578
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,230
that's not trustworthy I'll be looking

579
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,370
for a job so I think that's a good place

580
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:07,310
female is an important messaging medium

581
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,260
if you know who's affected so for

582
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,490
instance if it's a small subset of a

583
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,350
user population and you can reach

584
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,910
directly out to those people and say

585
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:18,290
here the details that are important to

586
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:21,380
you social media this Twitter is going

587
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,430
to become a big thing I think it's

588
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,980
important to be able to get your

589
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:29,960
incident details out on social media and

590
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,990
press releases are still a big thing for

591
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,300
some people so being able to get those

592
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,390
out into those four mediums tends to be

593
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,370
a pretty complete picture but again at

594
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,990
least from what I've seen the best thing

595
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:43,729
you can do is link some link all of

596
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:48,620
those directly back to a particular

597
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,110
website so now we name names now we do

598
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,719
some case studies and we're gonna go

599
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,429
from some people who give us a lot of

600
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,440
things to learn to some people who have

601
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,490
done this fairly fairly well does

602
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,850
anybody wanna get I want to guess where

603
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,850
I'm gonna start

604
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:09,320
huh HipChat

605
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:11,200
no come on huh that HBGary wasn't very

606
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:18,409
good okay

607
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:20,450
superfish is that a band okay thought

608
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,410
about doing OPM it's all about doing

609
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:27,410
Sony but really there's just a great

610
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:31,010
example here so let's talk about how

611
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:33,230
Target did crisis communications so

612
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,740
first I do a little timeline this was

613
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,130
kind of hard

614
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:41,480
actually so November 27th to December

615
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:43,370
15th the fraud apparently takes place in

616
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,970
fifth on the 15th they acknowledge it

617
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:51,889
internally it's only 40 million cards

618
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:54,740
it's not a not not huge the 18th Brian

619
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:58,580
Krebs puts out his first article on the

620
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:02,120
19th target admits it but it's

621
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,740
incredibly minimal very few cards and

622
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,479
then the 21st the bank's just starts

623
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,650
sending new cards to people which

624
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,570
doesn't sound terribly minimal on the

625
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,480
27th of December a third party

626
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:20,330
identifies card and PIN information that

627
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,370
goes beyond the the initial 40 70

628
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,290
million additional accounts are added

629
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,139
and I think we found another 30 million

630
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:30,970
later and interestingly from a PR

631
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:35,230
perspective on the 22nd they laid off

632
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:39,350
475 employees while having 700 open

633
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,630
positions that just doesn't look good

634
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,010
from a PR perspective in a technical

635
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:49,880
term that's a no-no so so I put in my

636
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,740
you know site target comm breach and I

637
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,770
start looking for information about the

638
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,730
particular breach so they've reorganized

639
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:02,360
their website since then but we got this

640
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:06,470
and this and this and here's a credit

641
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:12,320
monitoring FAQ um and on the 6th page I

642
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:16,090
found a PDF letter from the CEO to the

643
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,980
public and this was really really good

644
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:21,020
it was on the 6th page of Google and I

645
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,059
had to go hunting for it but it was

646
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,110
really good

647
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:25,670
sometime in March they figured out it

648
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,590
was really good and put it on the front

649
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,929
page and along with a smiling picture of

650
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:34,419
the guy so someone figured out it was

651
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:38,300
pretty good there were a lot of other

652
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:42,200
things in all this or you could go to

653
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:46,120
crabs and get everything in about three

654
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,389
links so that's not good

655
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,829
so for

656
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:53,779
clarity I gave them a four out of ten if

657
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:55,489
there hadn't been so many places to go

658
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:59,509
all the data was there but it was just

659
00:28:55,489 --> 00:29:01,669
hard to put it all together timeliness

660
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:04,729
didn't work out terribly well for target

661
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:06,109
they chose to notify really early so

662
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:08,450
they could say oh it's not a big deal

663
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:12,949
and then their investigation made it a

664
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:15,499
bigger deal actionability

665
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,119
I'm pretty sure I eventually figured out

666
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,879
that people got credit monitoring but

667
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,799
that's about all you don't really know a

668
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,718
lot about what they did from a security

669
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,889
perspective internally aside from fire a

670
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:29,479
bunch of people and the responsibility

671
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:31,908
but stuff because it depends where you

672
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:34,700
look that that letter that I eventually

673
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:37,579
found did a fantastic job of taking

674
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,200
responsibility this this statement was

675
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:42,289
should have been the first thing on

676
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,729
target.com our top pirate priority is

677
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:45,408
taking care of you and helping you feel

678
00:29:43,729 --> 00:29:47,599
confident about shopping at Target and

679
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,099
it's our responsibility to protect your

680
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,718
information when you shop with us we

681
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:55,658
didn't live up to that responsibility

682
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:59,269
and I'm truly sorry so this is human

683
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:01,279
this is this is responsible and this is

684
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:03,950
clear I mean this this was a really

685
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,829
really well done statement and it sounds

686
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,659
human I don't know how many lawyers and

687
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:10,339
PR specialist went through this with a

688
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:14,599
fine-tooth comb but it sounds really

689
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:16,849
human so I gave them a 5 out of 10

690
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,019
because that part was great but you had

691
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:19,509
to go through a lot of fluff to get to

692
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:23,029
it

693
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:24,320
so and I want to be clear especially

694
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:28,129
there's anybody from Target in the room

695
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,718
I'm not busting on target they were in a

696
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:31,039
really tough spot you know one of the

697
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:33,979
things that was really apparent to me

698
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,139
when I looked through this is they were

699
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:38,599
coming up on the three weeks of their

700
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:41,508
year that basically make their entire

701
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:42,979
financial performance and so wanting to

702
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,479
do things like trying to hold everything

703
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:47,570
back and wanting to do things like

704
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:49,459
minimize it might not have been 100%

705
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,369
accurate from the security perspective

706
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:53,989
but at some point we're not here to

707
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:57,199
enable security we're here to enable a

708
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:59,269
business and from enabling business I

709
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,259
can understand where they made a lot of

710
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,259
the decisions that they made

711
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,350
please

712
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,960
fair enough fair enough no I'll admit

713
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,880
that I mean they they made it a

714
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,200
household thing partially because of the

715
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,970
scale at which they were dealing with

716
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,740
it's um plenty of other people have been

717
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,660
nasty have had nasty public breaches

718
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:49,280
very few have had a hundred and ten

719
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:52,600
million cards yeah yeah so a little bit

720
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,580
closer to home this is my alma mater

721
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,770
announced a few months ago that they had

722
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,689
been breached

723
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,700
they say Penn State engineering Penn

724
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,000
State runs a lab called the Applied

725
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,550
Research Lab that does almost

726
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,270
exclusively military research and

727
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,950
development so I mean basically I'm

728
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,960
reading between the lines that Penn

729
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:19,850
State engineering means the part that's

730
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,650
doing military research and we believe

731
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,449
they were attacked I mean they came out

732
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:28,130
and said they were attacked by a

733
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:30,740
nation-state hacker this gets funny so

734
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,020
they were able to talk about it as one

735
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,460
intrusion turns out there were two it

736
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,840
turns out they brought people in to look

737
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,730
for one intrusion and they said hey do

738
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,459
you know about these guys too and they

739
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:45,800
said no and things got twice as fun

740
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:51,350
no November 21st they got notified by

741
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:52,580
the FBI on May 15th

742
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:54,399
the engineering network has taken

743
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,780
offline all the statements are released

744
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm actually still taking a class

745
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,590
through Penn State so I got an email

746
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,810
that we got compromised so that was fun

747
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,649
that's my third one I couldn't remember

748
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,250
who it was

749
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:10,520
great okay good they did a really nice

750
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:13,820
job though of posting everything that

751
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,260
day on the 15th and then on the 18th

752
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,710
they announced that their networks back

753
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,120
online

754
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,270
everything's fine move on with your

755
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,270
lives

756
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:24,199
they made it onto a bunch of cool places

757
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:27,560
so they made it under e code they made

758
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,510
it into the Wall Street Journal then we

759
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:33,679
get to their actual statements about it

760
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:35,570
so their news site posted something the

761
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,230
president of the university posted a

762
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,439
fairly

763
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,020
long detailed write-up and then they put

764
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,850
together this really great FAQ site that

765
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,350
if you were actually interested in the

766
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,668
breach had everything you wanted to know

767
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,610
and you didn't have to listen to the

768
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,690
president in the university um and

769
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,520
what's really interesting and this is

770
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,410
again a kind of an aside um they ended

771
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,830
up making it onto the hill does anybody

772
00:33:54,410 --> 00:34:00,770
read the hill probably not cuz you're

773
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,879
not in Congress it's actually a news

774
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,660
publication that's aimed specifically at

775
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,940
congressional members and they're

776
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,409
they're staffing so it's it's

777
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,668
interesting that this made it to that

778
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:15,710
level you know they had a couple good

779
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:18,138
statements this probably being my

780
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,080
favorite about kind of explaining what

781
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,429
their timing was you know they gave us a

782
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,219
fairly detailed timeline but you're

783
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,810
sitting there going you got notified in

784
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:31,790
November you did something about it may

785
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:35,179
that's kind of a long time and they

786
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,469
actually spoke to that so they do a

787
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:38,929
little bit better than target in terms

788
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,350
of clarity they only had three sites you

789
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:44,659
needed to read

790
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm giving look it's my alma mater so

791
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:48,290
I'm giving them a little bit of benefit

792
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,300
of the doubt their timeliness was more

793
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,570
due to their investigation than anything

794
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,570
else

795
00:34:52,609 --> 00:34:56,569
the actionability was kind of limited

796
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,160
they didn't talk a lot about what they

797
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,560
did aside from taking the network down

798
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,540
the email they sent to students gave us

799
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,600
a little bit more to deal with but not a

800
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:08,900
whole lot because there wasn't really a

801
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:12,049
lot you know there was more focused on

802
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,390
what ARL could do and again once you got

803
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,440
to the statement by the president they

804
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:20,299
did a fairly good job of being

805
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,810
responsible and and human so for a

806
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:28,460
university 76 not great but they end up

807
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:32,299
getting a B - after the curve and the a

808
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,790
student or close enough was slack I

809
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,230
don't know if anybody uses slack if you

810
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:41,000
do you're probably in about six of them

811
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:45,290
like me and they announced a breach in

812
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,119
March and so they're they're kind of

813
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,820
cagey about the timeline they don't

814
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,090
explain a lot of it somewhere in early

815
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,970
fed

816
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:56,840
they had an incident they identified it

817
00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:00,259
going on for four days on March 27th

818
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,680
they finally published information and

819
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:09,560
they did just a blitz it came out on

820
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:11,779
email social media website all that and

821
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,640
it you know being there Silicon Valley

822
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,690
company made it onto every website Under

823
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,879
the Sun but here's the interesting thing

824
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:23,470
within four paragraphs in every example

825
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,180
there's a link back to their Tumblr site

826
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:31,129
so forth paragraphs little farther down

827
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:33,319
on wired here's their tumblr and it has

828
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:35,840
everything you could ever want to know I

829
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:38,000
literally was looking for questions to

830
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,590
give them a hard time about and I

831
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,660
couldn't find anything they hadn't

832
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,300
already identified they have a really

833
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:49,339
great FAQ that goes straight into a

834
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,930
bunch of actionable things so you know

835
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,430
they gave some some important key

836
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,109
statements that really clearly showed

837
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,620
whether you you need to be concerned

838
00:36:54,110 --> 00:37:01,580
about this or not so we know what was

839
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:04,220
accessed we know what wasn't accessed so

840
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,779
they didn't tell us how it happened but

841
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,549
honestly from from our perspective

842
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,690
that's not as important I mean it's

843
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,700
interesting to me from a research

844
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:13,520
perspective but it doesn't really help

845
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:17,210
me protect myself as a user so so they

846
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,120
get a nine out of ten they were timely

847
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,890
they speak in their faq to how the

848
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,069
timing kind of worked out and why it

849
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:28,609
worked the way it did their actionable

850
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:31,910
they released features they had a breach

851
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:33,800
and released features instead one of the

852
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,509
new psych articles actually talks

853
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,490
it basically says slack releases

854
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:39,490
features oh yeah they got breached -

855
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,230
that's a PR win in the best case

856
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:48,320
possible so they yeah they released

857
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,150
two-factor authentication and they

858
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,340
release a password kill switch that lets

859
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,370
teams reset all passwords in one shot

860
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:59,600
that's it that's actually really great

861
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:01,160
stuff the responsibility was good they

862
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,870
focused more on what actions they were

863
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,740
taking to keep things from getting worse

864
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,890
and make thing

865
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:10,129
is better than really gone of going into

866
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:13,430
their mistakes but but it was good they

867
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,590
didn't do as well on being human it did

868
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:18,020
kind of read like the security team had

869
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,640
wrote something then the legal team and

870
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,440
went through it then the PR team had

871
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,690
went through it then the legal team did

872
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,850
it again yeah but but they got a 94 they

873
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,360
did a really nice job if you go read

874
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:35,390
that FAQ it's actually it's a great

875
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:37,970
example there's a number of other people

876
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,290
who have done this fairly well it's

877
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,910
actually hard to find the PF Changs

878
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:43,970
stuff anymore they took it all offline

879
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,500
because you know they kind of solved it

880
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,390
in one shot and people didn't have to

881
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,650
keep coming back around

882
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:50,900
LastPass had an interesting

883
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,950
vulnerability about three weeks ago that

884
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:55,490
they did a really good job of

885
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:58,549
communicating what was going on there's

886
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,720
a small link at the bottom that starts

887
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,720
with a word my mom wouldn't want me

888
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:05,359
staying on stage

889
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,069
Afiya post-mortems actually does a

890
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,480
really good job of linking to good post

891
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,800
mortems that you can use for for

892
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,940
examples so by the way we've been

893
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,130
through about a hundred and ten slides

894
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,869
it's going pretty well

895
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,910
so in closing this amazing quote from

896
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:22,280
Warren Buffett it takes 20 years to

897
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,049
build a reputation five minutes to ruin

898
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,830
it if you think about that you'll do

899
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,960
things differently you only get one shot

900
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,840
to talk about these breaches the first

901
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,680
time and if you don't do it well you're

902
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,400
going to be dealing with the

903
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,009
repercussions for a very long time

904
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,500
so to do this better what what you can

905
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,630
take home and you know start doing as

906
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,540
soon as you get back to do crisis

907
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,180
communications better make your crisis

908
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,160
communications plan know who you're

909
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,279
gonna have to message to know who's

910
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,350
going to decide how you message know

911
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,570
what methods you're going to use to

912
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:00,950
message so know whether you're gonna

913
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,010
publish a press statement or whether

914
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:05,720
you're gonna go on Twitter first and

915
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,670
know your voice know how you want to

916
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,709
talk about that stuff there's a lot of

917
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,600
public relations stuff talking about

918
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,220
voice and it's it's really key when it

919
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:17,420
comes to dealing with an incident I

920
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,509
might have said these once or twice but

921
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:24,859
or what be clear be timely actionable

922
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:26,299
responsible and human I did steal a

923
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,940
bunch of stuff from people who know more

924
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:31,069
about this than I do Kate works at

925
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,200
github so she probably can't help you

926
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:35,540
very much Rachel

927
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,790
and Kristin both are our public folks

928
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:40,730
who do this for for consulting if you're

929
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:43,460
interested mark in Braco was one of

930
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,170
github x' original ops people and he

931
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,180
kind of wrote the book from from github

932
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:54,109
x' perspective on how we do this type of

933
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:57,618
messaging well so I'm Roberts there's a

934
00:40:54,109 --> 00:41:02,890
link to my original blog post appreciate

935
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:02,890
you coming out it's early no coffee spit

936
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:13,950
I wonder if I leave this up longer if it

937
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,509
makes you clap longer all right now I

938
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:22,490
don't know that wasn't that wasn't that

939
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:22,490
no um I'm happy to take questions

940
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:30,480
sure no problem

941
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,420
I promise it doesn't go to some we're

942
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:53,370
hosting Safari Firefox but not chrome

943
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:55,770
O'Day okay any questions we do mean we

944
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,450
have an on-call rotation and whoever's

945
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,250
on call when something happens is is

946
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,290
incident commander and that's that's how

947
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:04,350
we deal with it you know there may be

948
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,970
circumstances where it gets big enough

949
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:08,400
we want to start shuffling that around

950
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:09,779
but at least the initial is generally

951
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,500
going to be handled by the person who's

952
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,500
on call at the time

953
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:34,440
so for some reason most of our public

954
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,410
relations team came out of the crisis

955
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,050
communications is kind of their default

956
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,759
thing so if it turns out that was the

957
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:45,180
thing we were already really good at and

958
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,740
and had a lot of very sharp people we

959
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,080
learned a lot of lessons for the

960
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,729
security side of it from the ops side of

961
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,860
it because it turns out a lot of the

962
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:55,350
lessons that go into how to deal with a

963
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:57,330
breach or a you know DDoS or something

964
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:00,330
like that are the same you have to talk

965
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:03,120
about if a transit provider goes out for

966
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:07,410
something totally non malicious so we

967
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:10,490
thankfully had some not as bad practice

968
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:10,490
in that regard so

969
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:42,499
that's that's that's really tough and

970
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,640
and from my perspective that's where

971
00:43:42,499 --> 00:43:46,529
that's why the security team doesn't

972
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,170
handle this on its own that's why we

973
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:53,339
bring in our PR team to help us manage

974
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:55,079
that because in a lot of cases I mean

975
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,130
the answer is it depends you know if

976
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,960
there's a if there's another

977
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,329
organization that you can reach directly

978
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,599
out to and have a dialogue you can

979
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:05,130
coordinate that in some cases you don't

980
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,640
have that option and you just have to

981
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:11,190
kind of to go with it but but that's

982
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,038
part of why putting out the best message

983
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,229
you can ahead of time and being the ones

984
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,789
who control the start of it makes a big

985
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:20,609
difference you know the thing that slack

986
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:23,009
did was because they put out so much

987
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:23,749
information in the first moment you knew

988
00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:26,549
about it

989
00:44:23,749 --> 00:44:29,308
there wasn't a lot of other story there

990
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:31,529
wasn't a lot you know Brian Krebs didn't

991
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:34,799
write an article that I know of I looked

992
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:36,420
about slack because frankly they'd told

993
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:37,979
the whole story and all he was going to

994
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,049
do was reiterate everything that they'd

995
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:44,029
already said and if you can get to that

996
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:44,029
position you kind of get to win

997
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:04,500
yes absolutely so based on our internal

998
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:07,140
messaging on this I can't go into

999
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:11,670
details but we had the DDoS that we

1000
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:14,460
dealt with a few weeks ago feels like

1001
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:17,130
it's been forever and based on the

1002
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,700
nature of the DDoS public researchers

1003
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:22,440
we're doing a lot of digging into the

1004
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,500
JavaScript and Jack's and things like

1005
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,500
that

1006
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:30,660
you know our timelines changed because

1007
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,790
of that it didn't necessarily mean it

1008
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,359
was a bad thing in some cases they were

1009
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:39,680
able to say things that we didn't but it

1010
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,680
definitely has to be taken into account

1011
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:57,069
yes that's actually a great a great

1012
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:57,069
point I mean having a off your major

1013
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:02,598
perimeter place to post information is

1014
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:05,990
really key so I know we use a

1015
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,569
third-party service as a for our status

1016
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,819
site and that's essentially where we'd

1017
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:14,650
post things if for some reason we

1018
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:14,650
couldn't post directly to github.com

1019
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:25,849
there's a few that do already so anybody

1020
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:42,140
else cool well I'm around thanks for

1021
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:44,930
coming out all right so we got a break

1022
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:49,538
here we got a break until 10:15 come

1023
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:49,538
back in you know choose track 1 track 1
