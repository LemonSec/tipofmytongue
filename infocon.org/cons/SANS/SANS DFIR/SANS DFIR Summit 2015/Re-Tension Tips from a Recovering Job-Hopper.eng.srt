1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
close and you don't know why things

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,430
aren't working out like you're not

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,219
getting any good candidates you don't

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,649
understand why you might be sinking your

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,630
line into the little fish pool you're

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,780
not getting any good bites well this is

7
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,869
what we got sis just recently we pulled

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,009
all of the instant responders

9
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,920
organizations doing exactly what you're

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,439
doing and what we found was well the

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,960
most critical elements an effective

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,990
incident response was skilled staff

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,189
right everyone is emphasizing that we

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,739
need people who know what they're doing

15
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,440
you guys would agree with that we also

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,449
have another survey that says it is most

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,670
difficult to hire the people that know

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,050
how to do forensics red teaming and

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,780
whatever that other thing is writing

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,390
code these people are hard to find right

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,160
so I'm going to back this up with twenty

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,750
eight percent of people polled say they

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,870
have an a problem a shortage in IT

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,030
professionals infosec in particular so

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,059
it's akin what you think you're doing

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,610
and kind of putting a line in the fish

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,289
pond much like no matter how hard you're

28
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,850
sucking from the fish pond there's only

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,860
a couple fish in there and we're all

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,798
fighting to get them right we're all

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,869
seeking to hire the same skill set those

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,240
people who are technical experts in our

33
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,970
field so what's going to make people

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,460
stay what's going to get them on the

35
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,789
line even just to begin the conversation

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,009
with you well we know based on another

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,640
survey these are awesome but forty two

38
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,680
percent of IT professionals polled will

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,180
likely leave their job in one to two

40
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,220
years amazing amazing stats also asked

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,710
you know what what would make you depart

42
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,390
your current position we have a list of

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,689
four different things lack of

44
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,909
advancement stagnant wages all right

45
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,279
inadequate benefits and lack of job

46
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,460
stability so if we take these we kind of

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,110
shop off each one we can kind of

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,048
organize ourselves around this how do we

49
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,270
make ourselves more desirable as an

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,520
employer just never thought you'd say

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,519
that right never thought that working

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,258
with you would be hard sell I understand

53
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,500
I understand so we start out talking

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,529
about salary man salary

55
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,840
it's not that big of an issue we can say

56
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,050
that those six things that are on this

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,390
slide are like a six legged stool so i

58
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:25,700
will tell you you can undercut one of

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,799
these legs but don't try undercutting

60
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,500
two or three your stool is going to fall

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,450
over so as we approach this you know

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,760
depending on where your company is you

63
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,640
might not be able to draw someone away

64
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,590
from an area that has really good wages

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,260
say sucking out of Mountain View

66
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,450
California or the DC area but i'm

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,399
telling you you can still well you can

68
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,000
still attract good talent if that's your

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,709
only short leg in your stool so we'll go

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,690
forward we go forward the reason why

71
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,080
this works is based on another survey

72
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,359
only one out of four infosec

73
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,270
professionals polled said it's all about

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,160
the money only one of four that was

75
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,989
their top interest the salary what are

76
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,090
the other people say though they

77
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,380
actually said it's about the mission you

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,000
guys would totally agree with that

79
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,680
that's why you're here that's why you do

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,600
instant response you do the

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,280
investigations that's what we love so if

82
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,109
you're able to convince people that

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,820
you're going to bring them in and give

84
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,160
them important work that's enough

85
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,380
forty-four percent they want important

86
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,720
work that's meaningful it's enough to

87
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,739
convince me definitely but when we look

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,540
at that third leg of my stool it's about

89
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,070
investing in people right and training

90
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,230
there's a lot of people that I talk to

91
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,850
on a daily basis off and on well my

92
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,260
company doesn't send anyone to training

93
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,180
we don't have the money for that and

94
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,160
then they wonder why they can't bring

95
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,170
people in the door they wonder why they

96
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,989
can't hire other people well it's

97
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,809
because when other people are looking to

98
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,549
check your place out they don't see any

99
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,650
of your employees at the industry

100
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,049
conferences they don't see anyone from

101
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,180
your company sitting next to them in

102
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,040
classes they know if they show up there

103
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,430
they're not going to get what they need

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,700
to grow and as infosec professionals if

105
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,730
we don't train we die right we roll into

106
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:12,950
this old dinosaur and we got we got to

107
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,980
come to ground with that for sure so

108
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,329
training is not just about paying

109
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,548
somebody a lot of money to get

110
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,650
foundational skills you need to set this

111
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,810
up in your environment mentoring my gosh

112
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,099
if you don't grow your team up right if

113
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,190
you expand it to quickly you're

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,920
not going to have this awesome master

115
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,800
apprentice relationship and that is how

116
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,040
you maintain quality and your team if if

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,060
you don't do any of these things man you

118
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,000
are going to be in trouble you're not

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,920
investing properly in and your employees

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,420
and people that are not on the hook

121
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,460
they're going to find out I'm never

122
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,190
going to check you out so offering a

123
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,719
career path man I will tell you that one

124
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,550
time I was in an interview someone

125
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,210
looked at my resume and said I think

126
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,070
it's time for you to become a manager

127
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,049
you're like big eyes who would ever say

128
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,940
that to her that's insanity but sure

129
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,790
enough he was trying to sell me on the

130
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,650
whole manager thing realize as you

131
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:10,350
probably do being in this field yeah

132
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,679
realize that there are some people who

133
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,310
don't want to manage Oh actually want to

134
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,570
be technical experts so yeah give

135
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,460
someone the carrot that they actually

136
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,170
want that actually motivates them this

137
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,659
is something that people don't want to

138
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,160
actually admit that we need time off you

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,870
need to set the culture in your

140
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,260
environment that time off is important

141
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,970
you as a manager establish that and make

142
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,900
it okay to actually spend some family

143
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:40,740
time dude culture you will not bring in

144
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,049
the badasses unless you build a team of

145
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,480
badasses you need to give them time to

146
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,760
innovate you need to give them time to

147
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,430
look as though they're badasses in front

148
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,980
of everyone else right so builds that

149
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,500
reputation for innovation and that's

150
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,410
what's going to attract people to your

151
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,680
team the last thing is as a manager

152
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,720
don't suck because people people they

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,300
don't leave jobs they leave managers and

154
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,660
that is how are you gonna build your

155
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:14,060
team of experts look at that cape all

156
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,060
right all right next up a news thank you
