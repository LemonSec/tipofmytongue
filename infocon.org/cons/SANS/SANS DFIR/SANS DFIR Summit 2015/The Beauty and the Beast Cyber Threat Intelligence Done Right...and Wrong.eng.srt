1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,958
and I also will use some control system

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,939
case studies is because I want to focus

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,710
on the analysis piece of it if I talk

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,719
about control systems most of you don't

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,179
have technical expertise there so we can

6
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,340
actually talk through analysis and if I

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,599
talk about Disney characters it actually

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,350
ties really well to threat intelligence

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,980
which is mostly made-up so why would the

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,210
co-author right so co-author of the

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,769
threat intelligence class telling it's

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,599
all made up bold move cotton let's see

13
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:28,859
if it pays off so I want you to leave

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
here understanding that you're gonna

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,329
come across a lot of characters in the

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,440
threat intelligence community and that's

17
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,910
basically what I want to talk about

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,829
today is the types of characters not

19
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,260
focusing on the individuals but the

20
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,180
types so the first type of character

21
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,219
that generally comes up is little chips

22
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,539
of the world right and their squeaking

23
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,610
and they talk and they're saying hey oh

24
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,590
my gosh I've got this crazy new threat

25
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,510
intelligence the world must know about

26
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,149
please click here and you won't believe

27
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,199
number three so when we see the chips of

28
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,899
the world it's usually like the

29
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,539
Chattanooga apt so what happened in this

30
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,100
case was Bloomberg the news organization

31
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,110
partnered with a threat intelligence

32
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,610
company and we've all seen those are

33
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,530
basically just PRWeb statements in the

34
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,240
form of the news breach yeah so they

35
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,280
came up and said we put a honeypot

36
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,750
online it's control system honey pots

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,970
and we saw 8,000 attacks from the US it

38
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,070
turns out the u.s. is the number one

39
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,039
target err of control systems in the

40
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,689
world the problem was at the very same

41
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,759
time that they were doing this there was

42
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,860
a Derby con presentation going on were a

43
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,930
couple ICS or control system engineers

44
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,119
we're scanning for control systems on

45
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,520
the internet and every time these people

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,439
at Bloomberg saw an internet connection

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,149
or scan on their honeypot they

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,820
registered it as an attack and they

49
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,950
tracked it back to Chattanooga in USA

50
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,189
for the number one targeted attack in

51
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,360
the world so not usually good the next

52
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,100
kind of character you'll generally see

53
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,140
is the guest stones of the world they

54
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,479
love to see their name in lights they're

55
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,009
very sort of bold and they love love

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,170
love the attention that you'll give them

57
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,790
well back to Bloomberg it's not always

58
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,630
Bloomberg just happens to be for control

59
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,700
systems this time

60
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,089
Bloomberg put out another story and said

61
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,128
the first act of cyber war was in 2008

62
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,319
there was a pipeline at the time and

63
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,569
Turkey that actually did blow up the BTC

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,530
pipeline blew up it was a big commotion

65
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,208
not you

66
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,640
good when your entire oil pipeline has a

67
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,530
big disruption in Turkey that was

68
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,290
attributed at the time to the terrorists

69
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,580
in the region kgk the turkey government

70
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,950
said we think it's the terrorists the

71
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,360
terrorists said yep it was us and blue

72
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,310
Berg still came out and said no it was

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,280
the Russians and that's usually not how

74
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,350
you do threat intelligence so what the

75
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,810
reporter decided to do is a couple

76
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,940
months ago published out a report saying

77
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,890
it turns out it was the Russians it was

78
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,260
a cyber attack they got in through the

79
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,029
IP connected surveillance systems they

80
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,829
got down into the control systems and

81
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,480
incident responders and anonymous

82
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,120
intelligence officials told us it was

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,730
the Russians that rataxes through cyber

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,410
the problem was the IP surveillance

85
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,359
equipment that they said was the initial

86
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,510
attack vector wasn't installed until

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
after the explosion as a result and

88
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,540
unfortunately the type of data they said

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
they gathered from the field systems

90
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,530
wasn't enabled there's no logging on

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,170
that type of control system that that

92
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,090
pipeline had and what happened here is

93
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,819
the reporter did not have the technical

94
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,319
expertise on the control systems to know

95
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,720
the information they were getting was

96
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,790
bad so in the first case study we saw

97
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,230
someone taking raw data and saying it

98
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,359
was intelligence which it's usually not

99
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,429
and when then the next case started we

100
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,799
saw this reporter who didn't have the

101
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,480
technical experience to know what would

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,850
be good information about an incident

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,170
and that's usually why I say most of

104
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,540
threat intelligence ends up being made

105
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,760
up is people take raw data and claim it

106
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,910
to be intelligence your AV signature or

107
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,980
your threat feed is not intelligence

108
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,890
analysts and people make intelligence

109
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,260
tools are required it's very helpful to

110
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,690
have good tools collect data and to give

111
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,250
you better information but no tool can

112
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,790
give you intelligence because it

113
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,930
requires analysis and analysts but

114
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,760
unfortunately in this give me a little

115
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,010
dart to see some of the biggest you know

116
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,690
sort of beastly players and threat

117
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,220
intelligence that we see combine the

118
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,190
features of the two previous case

119
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,570
studies in this case Norris partnered

120
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,010
with a Norse was a threat intelligence

121
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,230
company they partner with AEI

122
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,390
conservative think-tank and they said

123
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,918
you know what we have identified that

124
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,358
the Iranians are preparing for an

125
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,940
offensive against the United States

126
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,260
critical infrastructure and we believe

127
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,840
that if you go forward us with policy

128
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,090
negotiations with Iran and the nuclear

129
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,400
you will be helping them fund cyber

130
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,169
weapons against the power grid so a

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,429
threat intelligence company partnered

132
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,258
with a think tank to make policy

133
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,870
statements about ongoing nuclear

134
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:41,759
negotiations that's generally what I see

135
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,680
to be the worst in the field is when you

136
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
leave the bubble of us all being critics

137
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,530
on Facebook and Twitter and go out to

138
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,910
the world and make policy

139
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,679
recommendations to the president

140
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,229
that's not what I like to see based off

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,479
of your threat Intel the reason for this

142
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:55,710
is the people at Norris and this is not

143
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,330
bash Norris they actually have cool

144
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,849
product but just from this one case

145
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,469
study the problem in this case is they

146
00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:03,570
took a bunch of honey pots and stood

147
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,030
them up and they looked for scams and

148
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,099
any time they saw an nmap scan against

149
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,138
ports related with control systems not

150
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,509
real control systems they said this was

151
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,419
an attack any time they saw a TCP

152
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:16,770
connect to a port related to ICS or

153
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,840
control system they said this was an

154
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,789
attack and then they briefed the

155
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,258
government and said there was 500,000

156
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,270
attacks on industrial control systems

157
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,889
last 24 months and they didn't tell them

158
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,690
it was honeypot scams and they

159
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,220
attributed to the Iranians based on the

160
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,949
fact that they were Iranian IP addresses

161
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,720
not how you do threatened tel so when

162
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,449
we're looking at threatened tel what I

163
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,909
would leave you with today is you must

164
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,409
get data you must have technical

165
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:42,000
expertise let's get by as I'm going

166
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:44,430
through this you must have technical

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,430
expertise and you must correlate that

168
