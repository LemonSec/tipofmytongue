1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a little about tour and used</font>

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,440
to stand for the onion onion router

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,750
doesn't anymore they change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that few</font>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,580
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago so let's talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how it</font>

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,679
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all well it's pretty</font>

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,700
simple when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access the Internet I'm</font>

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to talk about how it bounces</font>

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,240
up all these mountains everything else

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,529
but it's and wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sniff your traffic</font>

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,390
browsing your site that's my ssl it's

11
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty straightforward people don't like</font>

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,359
this idea so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do they do well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,500
SS on the website or pickle couture and

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:39,200
it also complicates things some material

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,329
necessarily but<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection it offers so</font>

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,770
what it does is that you get three what

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:51,660
a cool knows you get entry node you get

18
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:53,610
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> and anything that you can get after</font>

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,929
the exit node is going to be completely

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,930
unencrypted unless L but it encrypts

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,559
everything back from that place so

22
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:08,430
anything you intercept traffic between

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,289
the exit nodes on the site<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,750
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get but you don't know</font>

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,780
where that's going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so a bit of a</font>

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,780
problem

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:25,240
there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other complicated</font>

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:30,520
issue the dark web<font color="#CCCCCC"> told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me they hit that</font>

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,720
term I talk was about so the dark web

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,339
has got<font color="#E5E5E5"> these nice little things called</font>

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,690
dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites where you don't actually</font>

32
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,520
come out of the Tor network to actually

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,230
come out the Tor network in order to

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,119
access information these are web servers

35
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,700
which is set up specifically so that

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:51,400
they cannot be these track the traffic

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,680
cannot be intercepted fun times the most

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,330
common way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will access or</font>

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's actually two common ways as a</font>

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:00,190
bootless you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the most common way</font>

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,790
is to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TPP the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tor browser bundle</font>

42
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,350
that thing is locked up tight<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they</font>

43
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring out new versions every few weeks</font>

44
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:11,470
and they fix patch all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

45
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,910
they have consists of a modified version

46
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:18,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox it also has a couple of other</font>

47
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,680
extensions in there too no script<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font>

48
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,080
particular note anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's</font>

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,890
fine no script has a list of sites

50
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,100
already that i can run scripts on there

51
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,100
by default

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:49,600
config file in this so this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works</font>

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:56,010
it caches nothing drive you still get

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:58,180
nothing what you can find is things like

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,709
visit to the tour website where they

56
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,240
downloaded it they ran it and execute

57
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,700
installed and then we're able to

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,860
continue to run it after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you see</font>

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,589
we've listed a few here different things

60
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,690
you can look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is there well</font>

61
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,250
tours got an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> of TVB's got</font>

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,560
interesting couple of little things it's

63
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,960
got the state file which<font color="#CCCCCC"> will tell you</font>

64
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,120
the last time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tall was run it also</font>

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,300
has the tour see file which tells you

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,880
where it was last run one from so you

67
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">may already know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because the</font>

68
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,650
default installations already listed

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,470
there but it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to know is</font>

70
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:41,920
there anything else well no history

71
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,830
history is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and even</font>

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than a year ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dfi</font>

73
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,280
our summit that was held in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague</font>

74
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,059
someone gave a presentation on this and

75
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:55,360
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found or talked about the HTTP</font>

76
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,610
memory only PB thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,470
search for which is private browsing for

78
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox which is located in memory</font>

79
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,750
doesn't exist anymore it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

80
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,519
which is a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem because that</font>

81
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,790
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the only thing you can get</font>

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:13,300
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a computer which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not currently</font>

83
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:15,690
being used is very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little you know</font>

84
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,190
it was installed you know it was used

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,500
the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing though is that most</font>

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:26,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are stupid well</font>

87
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,639
let's say not technically adept um so if

88
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,639
they think oh I'll 101 tour this is

89
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:37,169
great but wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute I can't access</font>

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,510
pornhub so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install I want to</font>

91
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,520
install flash so they go on install

92
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,900
flash which is great because then we go

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,880
all these Flash cookies and everything

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,400
else and and traffic and get intercepted

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,350
that's not encrypted wonderful and then

96
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,270
I think or crap all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these stupid things</font>

97
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that keep popping up saying I can't</font>

98
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,440
access this so I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,570
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> visit this site well no you can't</font>

100
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,600
do that either so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they turn off the</font>

101
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,540
settings or because these websites dark

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,400
web sites have like hugely long

103
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,720
complicated URLs where'd our onion that

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,250
you can't remember those so they

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,950
bookmark the mr. which is really helpful

106
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,690
and then there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack vectors</font>

107
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,310
to so you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from the actual dead</font>

108
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:25,400
box computer itself and if you work for

109
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the NSA and if you do I hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too um</font>

110
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:32,280
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of attacks around so you</font>

111
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,680
can own a whole bunch of tour nodes

112
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,960
there's only six thousand there in

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,600
active use so if you suddenly flooded

114
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,359
the Tor network with a bunch of nodes

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,340
you can pretty much decipher where that

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,590
traffic is coming from then there's also

117
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:53,940
stuff like all the cisco routers which

118
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:56,789
you can use to do you do attacks on to

119
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,930
try and do a symmetric stuff but yeah

120
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,930
that's pretty much it
