1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
so I'm Cindy Murphy I've been a cop for

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,340
thirty years since I was 18 I'm also a

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,590
mother and somehow it all worked out I'm

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,649
not quite sure how and my my child is

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,830
grown and and a wonderful young lady in

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,800
her own right but I have loved police

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,570
work since day one and it was the right

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,039
job for me I was lucky enough to be

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:28,680
raised by parents who instilled in me a

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,650
great deal of confidence mixed with a

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,750
good deal of competence and showed me

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,019
that creativity mixed in with all of

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,600
that makes the full package so all I'm

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,210
saying is we've we really have come a

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,350
long ways and and I don't think we

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,059
should take it for granted ever

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,840
especially considering we've only been

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,000
able to vote since 1920 and we still

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,920
only make 78 cents on the dollar so we

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,289
got to find our value someplace else

21
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,600
okay moving on the investigation so just

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,820
a year ago a little over a year ago in

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,000
February 2014 at six eleven in the

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,070
morning there was a 911 for home

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,590
invasion a couple called from a

26
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,149
Walgreens and said that their house had

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,509
been broken into and they've been

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,310
assaulted they were newly married she

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,680
was six months pregnant he was legally

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,509
blind and six suspects had entered their

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,600
house actually four had entered their

32
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,369
house but six were involved in the end

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,470
and had robbed them and as the

34
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,659
investigation went forward it was

35
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,130
revealed that the wife who was six

36
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,790
months pregnant had been sexually

37
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,119
assaulted by many of the suspects

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:46,070
multiple times including a pretty brutal

39
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,930
anal assault so this was not a typical

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,779
investigation for our city

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,790
it was extremely violent and seemed to

42
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,799
be random because this couple was not

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,960
involved in drug dealing they weren't

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,240
involved in anything where they owned

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,289
anybody money or more involved in

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,439
illegal behaviors they were true victims

47
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:10,289
the husband is nearly legally blind as a

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,269
matter of fact so they're they're truly

49
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,280
innocent which is is something that

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,160
doesn't

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,500
when happen so officers respond to the

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,569
residents and they begin their

53
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:24,880
investigation they learn the house was

54
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:27,410
ransacked valuables credit cards money

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,609
computer equipment cell phones were

56
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:33,290
taken and as the officers are there they

57
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,620
start to hear this argument going on

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,100
next door in the in the duplex right

59
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:41,840
next door and so some of them break off

60
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,420
to go next door and see what's happening

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,420
and they they find out that a woman

62
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,730
named femi who's a prostitute and a

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,880
heroin addict and her boyfriend

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,590
Andy who's a tattoo artist and the

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,549
intended victim of this home invasion

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,620
are arguing because Andy has looked at

67
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:04,160
his cell phone which Femi borrowed and

68
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,459
found a text message that that bothers

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,160
him so this is Femi not your usual

70
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:17,540
suspect right anybody notice anything

71
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:22,269
looking at Feeney right off the bat okay

72
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,340
so she is a hardcore heroin addict and

73
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:27,440
really what her life is about is finding

74
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,959
her next fixed and it really doesn't

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,049
matter to her how she gets it it's it's

76
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,230
it's an awful drug and it has affected

77
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:37,810
way too many of our of our families in

78
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:44,119
the world including my own

79
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:45,500
so witnesses come forward there was

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,769
somebody staying with Femi and the

81
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,470
tattoo artist and he says that they were

82
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:53,359
arguing about a Facebook message

83
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:56,230
specifically a message where Femi wrote

84
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:59,510
what the you hit the wrong house

85
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,429
and and I will tell you I am a cop for

86
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,870
30 years I'm gonna swear during this and

87
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,810
there will be a video that's got some

88
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,540
swearing in it but it's it's a part of

89
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,440
the reality I live in and so so I'm

90
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:17,269
sorry if there's anybody who's offended

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:20,418
so Femi was arguing back saying I'm not

92
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,798
lying they weren't supposed to be they

93
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,060
weren't supposed to hit the wrong house

94
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,729
and they weren't supposed to bring three

95
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,300
people it was supposed to be one guy and

96
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,680
then and

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,440
says he's gonna show the Facebook

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,960
messages to the police and she grabs for

99
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,099
the phone and they start wrestling and

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,159
have an argument and then witnesses

101
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:42,259
helped Andy by pulling Femi away from

102
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:44,479
him because she really didn't want to go

103
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:50,330
to jail so we have our first phone it's

104
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:52,550
a samsung our 950 and we get facebook

105
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,719
and call history with family and friends

106
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,039
off of that phone really quite easily

107
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,930
celebrate supported it there were no

108
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,710
issues whatsoever with downloading the

109
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,509
phone and the phone was used to

110
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,878
communicate with moe

111
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:12,530
who is he means drug dealer and it

112
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,639
became apparent through text messages

113
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:21,948
that Femi owed Moe a lot of money and

114
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:24,319
she then after officers confronted her

115
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,490
at the scene and talked to her about

116
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,039
what the statements from the witnesses

117
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,789
were said that she had had a

118
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,500
conversation with Moe about how much

119
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,870
cash and he was bringing home in his

120
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,630
business and then she wanted to swing

121
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,639
things towards Andy and make him the bad

122
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,949
guy and said you know there's a lot of

123
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,669
tax evasion going on and he's dealing

124
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:50,770
some drugs and and you know don't look

125
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:55,099
at me you deserve this

126
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,680
so the story that comes out is that Femi

127
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,419
and Moe we're going to break into Andy's

128
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,949
duplex and steal cash

129
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:02,479
Femi didn't want to do this on her own

130
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:09,199
she wanted to continue the relationship

131
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:11,930
with with Andy so she and he start

132
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,409
planning to have this this set up for a

133
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:18,199
home invasion she says to the police

134
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,940
that she called him the the night before

135
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,199
the attack happened and tried to call

136
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,319
the whole thing off that she had had

137
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,620
second thoughts and that there must be

138
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,310
an easier way to get money but that he

139
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:35,990
hadn't listened to her and had recruited

140
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,419
accomplices in order to hit the duplex

141
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,280
she then insists that she has no idea

142
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:42,219
who any of you

143
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,789
people are and that she thought he would

144
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,919
be alone and interestingly even though

145
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:51,280
she says she made this phone call

146
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,139
Jephthah left the back door open to the

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,340
house she she unlocked it it's a door

148
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:58,960
that is generally always locked so so

149
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,070
there's some inconsistencies in her

150
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,270
story which is totally not unusual so

151
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:11,110
from that phone from the beginning with

152
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,359
phone one Andy has told us hey that's

153
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,510
that's the phone I use for my business I

154
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,790
get over a thousand calls a day okay

155
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,510
well our intended victim now is looking

156
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,190
kind of weird

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,900
does anybody get over a thousand calls a

158
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,000
day does anybody know anybody who gets

159
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,849
over a thousand calls a day he doesn't

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,729
get over a thousand calls a day but but

161
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,210
that's that's that's how busy his tattoo

162
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:38,740
business is according to him the cops

163
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,479
originally leave that phone with him and

164
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,870
they asked the victim to send

165
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,800
screenshots of the conversations on

166
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,530
Facebook which he does

167
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,710
which is a weird way to collect evidence

168
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,909
but you know again eventually we got the

169
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,310
phone and got it downloaded without

170
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,870
issues but we had this other source of

171
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,970
strange phone evidence too so when he

172
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,919
finds out that this was not just a home

173
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,510
invasion and people were beat up but

174
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,120
that a woman who is six months pregnant

175
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,900
was sexually assaulted

176
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,900
pretty brutally he did give us consent

177
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,120
to download his phone but said to us

178
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,979
that he needed it right away which is

179
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
which is really a common request of

180
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,990
people who who give up their phones to

181
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,360
law enforcement it's it's problematic

182
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:32,380
for us especially as phones get larger

183
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,260
because we just don't have the personnel

184
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,549
or the ability to do phones instantly

185
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,439
anymore the way we used to so this was

186
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,209
one of the screen shots that came

187
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,550
mohit me up I think we should do this

188
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,870
tonight he's got over 1500 in his pocket

189
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,650
and doesn't plan on leaving till late

190
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,520
tonight maybe you could be waiting in

191
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,350
the parking lot

192
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,050
hit us up on screen

193
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,240
and whatnot play it out and you can run

194
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,290
afterwards towards Ivy she doesn't look

195
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,270
so cute anymore at this point really

196
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,069
she's pretty desperate and then she says

197
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,960
well here's another plan let's do it by

198
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,480
the Four Seasons carwash there's no or

199
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,360
by his house there's no cameras he lives

200
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,640
in a duplex two streets behind four

201
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,230
seasons on east wash that seems better I

202
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,830
think it should go down at his house not

203
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,580
at the shop so she is absolutely and

204
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,680
totally involved in this and describes

205
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,900
the car unfortunately she never ever

206
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,079
gives an address right so she just says

207
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:34,870
here's generally where the duplex is and

208
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,700
I guess she's hoping that Moe and

209
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:45,250
company will hit the right house so his

210
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:49,270
answer to her is okay when and then he's

211
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:53,080
asking her to call him and then we get

212
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,610
the message in question you'll notice 21

213
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,790
minutes ago so this screenshot was taken

214
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:03,340
really pretty quickly after the assault

215
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:07,240
happened so there is this message call

216
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,810
me call me boo sent nine hours before

217
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:13,390
the attack happened that sort of

218
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:16,180
indicates that maybe the story that she

219
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,500
was telling that she called him that

220
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,680
night and told him to call the whole

221
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,840
thing off might be true

222
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,660
unfortunately call records for all of

223
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,970
the phones involved didn't didn't show

224
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,640
that at all so while he wanted her to

225
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,510
call him I don't know maybe to figure

226
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,610
out the right address it's maybe not

227
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,569
speculation but that never happened so

228
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,250
we have to remember though that every

229
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,870
conversation has two sides this is

230
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,010
really compelling evidence right that's

231
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:51,940
that seems like an open-and-shut case

232
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:55,450
but in order to figure out whose Mo's

233
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:59,170
accomplices were and to tie him to the

234
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,600
communications absolutely we really

235
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:04,240
needed to get into the phone that Moe

236
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,620
had been using his phone was obtained

237
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,720
during a consent search of a

238
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,540
girlfriend's

239
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,900
which we found by pinging the victims

240
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,530
phones so the victims phones who had

241
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,870
been robbed

242
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,760
we set up pings on those phones they

243
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,010
took us right to all of the proceeds of

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,630
the robbery at the ex-girlfriends house

245
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,790
some bad guys are smarter and they turn

246
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:33,970
off phones after they grab them but not

247
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:36,349
all of them are so we found the cash

248
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,360
credit cards the credit cards all are in

249
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,610
the name of the the victims from the

250
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,290
home invasion so again this is a case

251
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,050
that's coming together really pretty

252
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:49,670
strongly victim's wedding ring and those

253
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:52,459
sorts of things the cash the credit

254
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,380
cards are found on most person he's

255
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,800
arrested for a parole violation and he's

256
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,380
interviewed as a witness to the robbery

257
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,170
and he's cooperative for a little bit

258
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,470
says he had the phone that he

259
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,939
communicated with for 20 days and that's

260
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,110
all because he had just gotten out of

261
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,660
prison 20 days earlier and he gives the

262
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,000
phone number but nobody ever bothered to

263
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,010
ask him for the passcode which he

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,050
probably would have given because he was

265
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,990
at that point talking and sort of

266
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,479
minimizing his involvement in this thing

267
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,440
and kind of throwing accomplices under

268
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,170
the bus as fast as he could the phone in

269
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,530
question is a Nokia at 520 Windows Phone

270
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,900
8 device at the time totally and

271
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:45,439
completely unsupported by any forensic

272
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:48,680
tool for data extraction so I said none

273
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:54,380
at all but we could get media files over

274
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:56,300
MTP unfortunately because the phone was

275
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,970
password protected though we weren't

276
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,030
even able to get that far

277
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:07,130
pass codes unknown we have an a now

278
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:10,490
under and a phone that isn't supported

279
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,220
by any tools and a demand for a speedy

280
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,900
trial happens soon after that and it's

281
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:20,810
Moe who's looking for the speedy trial

282
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:23,130
so at this point

283
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,300
people are coming to me and saying okay

284
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,890
I need you to get the data out of this

285
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,030
phone and I'm looking at them and saying

286
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:32,490
sorry I can't do magic I have done magic

287
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,459
and in other cases right but you have to

288
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:39,210
give me resources if you want magic and

289
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,270
so I put it back on my bosses about how

290
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,820
how much time and effort they wanted to

291
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,350
have put into this case they decided

292
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,810
based on the nature of the case that it

293
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,180
was important enough that they would

294
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,400
throw some resources at this so this

295
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,489
particular phone was sent to tiel

296
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:59,090
technology because at the time we didn't

297
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:02,460
have any JTAG equipment we now do and

298
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:04,410
and I've done a few JTAG extractions but

299
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,000
this is probably one we would send out

300
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:11,130
anyway just just based on some of the

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,970
some of the issues with the phone so

302
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:17,060
what that phone goes out it cost under a

303
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,290
thousand dollars because bill teal was

304
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,670
really nice to our police department

305
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,920
really nice

306
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,819
terrific least Department I had a

307
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,959
conversation with him on the phone a

308
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,440
conversation that I have many times with

309
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,240
vendors in which I said to him hey you

310
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,490
do us a favor and I'll do you a favor

311
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,500
and the favor I'll do you is whatever I

312
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,710
learned about Windows Phone 8 I'm going

313
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,640
to share right and and Bill's like okay

314
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:46,680
I know this and he also knows that

315
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,689
unlike folks in federal law enforcement

316
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,569
who in a lot of ways have a lot of

317
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,650
advantages I have one advantage you guys

318
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:57,900
in the feds don't have and that is I can

319
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,730
talk about my cases right like this is

320
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,250
the best thing about being local god I

321
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,110
can talk about my cases I can talk about

322
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,270
my cases in detail and if I have

323
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,250
permission I can share data right like

324
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:11,460
that's totally awesome it's unheard of

325
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,650
but it gives me an advantage as an

326
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,810
examiner that a lot of other folks don't

327
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,750
have because if I can throw datasets at

328
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,750
folks who know how to program and who

329
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:24,150
are developing tools and are looking for

330
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:27,780
that market advantage of having real

331
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:30,140
datasets to work from I get a lot in

332
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,420
return as a law enforcement officer in

333
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,300
in actually having my cases

334
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,760
move forward on unsupported devices so

335
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,069
that's that's my plug for being a local

336
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,300
law enforcement officer it's there's a

337
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,650
recent I've stayed all these years so

338
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,420
what do we know about Windows Phones so

339
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,740
that phones out I'm like okay I got to

340
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,199
figure out Windows Phone eight before

341
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,440
that phone comes back because I've got

342
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,910
literally less than than six weeks

343
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,600
before there's gonna be a trial in this

344
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,370
case which means I need to school myself

345
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,450
on what I need to know from from a

346
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:08,430
filesystem perspective so I go out onto

347
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:11,040
the Internet all the sites I can find

348
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,890
all of the forensic sites there's a lot

349
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,020
about Windows Phone 7 there's not a lot

350
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,520
about Windows Phone 8 in fact the only

351
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,640
thing I'm finding about Windows Phone 8

352
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,180
is the documentation from Microsoft and

353
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,340
from a forensic examiners standpoint we

354
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,989
all know that that sort of falls short

355
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:30,630
right like you know you're not going to

356
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,160
get what you need to know from from

357
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:38,040
what's publicly available on Microsoft

358
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,810
site so what do we know though we know

359
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,360
that windows phones are going to have

360
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,250
some similarities to pcs they're going

361
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,430
to have a file system registry files

362
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:50,670
used for settings and preferences files

363
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:55,469
page file dot sis which has been a

364
00:16:50,670 --> 00:17:00,079
successful area of of evidence for me in

365
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:02,160
the past I also know though from from

366
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,260
from the work I've done with Windows

367
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,040
Phone 7 and the research out there that

368
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:11,400
they use embedded databases that vall

369
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:16,319
files a lot as now does Windows 8 for

370
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:18,410
the PC side and Windows 10 will the

371
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,859
registry formats a little bit different

372
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:27,510
some of those registry components aren't

373
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:29,639
used and the usage artifacts and data

374
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:33,600
retention are are different for phones

375
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,600
than they are for PCs Windows Phone 8

376
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,909
and 8.1 also don't use all the same

377
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,919
mechanisms as a Windows computer

378
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,410
there's no prefetch file there's no

379
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,990
hyper fill dot source file no event logs

380
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,300
no shell bags so those things that are

381
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,140
our

382
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,460
Oh to evidence sources for Windows

383
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,520
machines aren't necessarily going to be

384
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,110
present in a Windows 8 Phone there's

385
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,530
Dave Cove are the man who kept me out of

386
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:02,050
the fight last night

387
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,450
you missed the story sorry I had to call

388
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,100
you out that's it's but I appreciate

389
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,830
that you took me out of they took me out

390
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,080
of the kept me from getting in a fight

391
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,699
last night you may not even remember it

392
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,909
was wise words you said to me so does

393
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,220
everyone else I told the story so

394
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:27,760
Windows Phone 8 also has the ability to

395
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,940
to carry a micro SD card from windows 7

396
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,850
phones though there are some

397
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,330
similarities in that the SD card is is

398
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,879
locked often to the particular device

399
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,129
with a key I have had people say to me

400
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,290
that this isn't always true that they've

401
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,790
been able to remove my micro SD cards

402
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,490
from Windows Phones and examine them

403
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:50,830
separately my experience has always been

404
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,270
that those cards won't read outside the

405
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:57,220
phone so that's why I said in in most

406
00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:02,200
cases because that's just what my

407
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,900
experience is when you put a new card

408
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,430
into a phone the OS the operating system

409
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,730
is going to automatically format the

410
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:13,110
newly inserted card and it's necessary

411
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,940
to acquire the card through the device

412
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,290
again if the device is locked we're not

413
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,660
going to have a whole lot of luck with

414
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,909
that traditional forensic tools won't

415
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:26,020
read the data content stored on the card

416
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:28,390
windows won't even recognize it and if

417
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,730
the SD card is removed and you try to

418
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:34,530
function you try to use the device it

419
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,610
may not it may not function fully so

420
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,850
there's a lot of interaction between

421
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,979
that card and the internal storage on

422
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,870
the phone itself Windows seven and eight

423
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,140
phones are designed to sync data with

424
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,439
the cloud so I'm looking for other

425
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:54,880
sources of data potentially what I have

426
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,330
though is is basically a gangbanger

427
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,730
who's fresh out of prison

428
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:03,449
and unlikely to be using cloud storage

429
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:08,010
as a solution for for his data storage

430
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,600
and it in this particular case really

431
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,030
this was his communication device it

432
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,189
wasn't that he was using it as a as a

433
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:17,399
computer

434
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:21,930
aside from Facebook and that sort of app

435
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:24,900
usage so but if they had been available

436
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,870
we could have gone to Microsoft SkyDrive

437
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,780
SkyDrive or look for a SharePoint

438
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,580
account that's the sort of thing we'd

439
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,830
need to get through a warrant which

440
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,810
would mean we'd need probable cause to

441
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:41,639
get that stuff so we'd need to know that

442
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:45,000
that was happening and again just as a

443
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,710
reminder if you have RF shielded your

444
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,750
device in other words you've isolated it

445
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,460
from the cell phone network we're not

446
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,010
going to see this stuff and so it's sort

447
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,270
of a cart horse proposition right like

448
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,800
do you know it's synced in the cloud

449
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,250
it's hard to know it's synced in the

450
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,030
cloud if you've protected your device

451
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:07,200
because you're not going to see that

452
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:10,410
data so when we're talking about

453
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,210
unlocked Windows eight phones we know

454
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:16,640
that we can get to some of the data on

455
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:19,530
the devices through USB there are

456
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,110
various different interfaces to do that

457
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:25,100
there's the MTP protocol where we can

458
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,469
grab music pictures videos in ringtones

459
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,879
which in this case might have been

460
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,380
somewhat helpful

461
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,700
there's IP over USB 4 SDK development if

462
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,500
I'd have been able to get into the

463
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,450
unlocked phone this might have been a

464
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,480
possibility right like just go in as a

465
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:46,310
developer and start attacking it

466
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,750
somewhat like we do androids over a TB

467
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:51,179
vid stream is an interface that you use

468
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,090
on retail devices to allow the phone to

469
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,380
mirror its display to a PC that's not

470
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,490
going to do me much good from a forensic

471
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,520
standpoint but it is an option as a USB

472
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,740
connection and then there's this KD net

473
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,490
over USB for debugging and interaction

474
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,990
sorry and this is for registered

475
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,840
developers only

476
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:16,140
this for me in the future people who are

477
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,820
looking to do some research that's

478
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,260
something to look at

479
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,159
right like somebody needs to become a

480
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,350
registered developer to play with that

481
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:28,380
kt net over USB because i think that

482
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,510
there's some potential there for us to

483
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,350
get into these devices this may actually

484
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,360
be part of the solution that some of the

485
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,879
forensic companies have come up with for

486
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,040
acquisition of Windows 8 phones since

487
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,820
the time that this case happened a year

488
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,309
ago but if the phones locked with that

489
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,960
you have to be or with a pen or the data

490
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:53,220
connection notification is enabled when

491
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,809
it's connected a lot of these these

492
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,630
connection options aren't going to work

493
00:22:54,809 --> 00:23:00,780
for us and so I had a locked phone

494
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:03,990
basically was stuck aside from the JPEG

495
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,790
option there's also the possibility that

496
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,630
this phone might be synced to a computer

497
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:11,220
again I'm dealing with with a person who

498
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,620
doesn't have necessarily a permanent

499
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,300
home there was no information to say he

500
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:17,969
had a PC that this phone might have been

501
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:21,389
synced with so not enough to get

502
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:25,679
warrants not enough to do to explore

503
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:31,559
that particular potential evidence

504
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,600
source so what I did know from doing

505
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,790
Windows 7 phones is that some of our

506
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:42,389
traditional file system forensics tools

507
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:44,460
work and if you take 585 forensics

508
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:47,280
course that that Heather and we Craig

509
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,809
nail and I have have written you'll see

510
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,178
that we do we spent a lot of time

511
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,940
talking about leveraging all the tools

512
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,400
in your tool kit not just sticking to

513
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,620
the I want to say traditional but it's

514
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,210
really not a tradition yet right but not

515
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,909
just sticking to the mobile forensic

516
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:05,340
tools because oftentimes you will

517
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,020
actually be able to do more from a

518
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,290
functionality standpoint using their

519
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,500
traditional file system forensic tools

520
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:16,559
than you will using the using the other

521
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,390
tools so we'll teach acquire the data

522
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,520
however you can get as much as you can

523
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,570
and then use whatever tool you have at

524
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,600
your disposal to get to what you need

525
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:29,980
that's that's that's what I try to

526
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,840
practice when I'm at work and I know

527
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,580
that there are varying levels of support

528
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,370
by mobile forensic tools for Windows 8

529
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,230
Phone he's and for Windows Phone in

530
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,860
general it's not so good right anybody

531
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,650
had to deal with these it's not so good

532
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,949
the the Windows Phones are traditionally

533
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:51,430
hard animals from a forensics standpoint

534
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:54,820
so we talked a little bit about registry

535
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:57,490
analysis on phones again we're gonna

536
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,919
have registry entries that are stored in

537
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,540
hive files active registry files are

538
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,290
locked by the operating system this

539
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:08,050
remains true for Windows Phone 8 and it

540
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:12,760
prevents copying but some tools can

541
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:15,520
reach out and read the data as its as

542
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,590
its actively on the device and present

543
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,160
that to you in XML format so that you

544
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:25,360
can work with it this was actually a

545
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,050
paraben first it's one of the things

546
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,389
that I think paraben did better than

547
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,360
other tools early on and it's it's maybe

548
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:38,320
maybe maybe their one and only claim to

549
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,959
it's a lasting faith so that was that

550
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,520
was kind of a dig but it's it's not a

551
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
tool I've had much success with it

552
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,760
doesn't maybe I'm using it wrong it's

553
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,399
it's it could be user error but using a

554
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,890
remote registry editor you can get to

555
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:59,890
some of those files the inactive ones

556
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:00,970
and work with them as well so the other

557
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,710
thing that I started doing was

558
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,780
researching security on these devices

559
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,340
because obviously with a passcode

560
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:11,170
protected phone I'm going to need to

561
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:14,350
find a way around that problem Windows

562
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,870
Phone 8 uses trusted boot and code

563
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,110
signing to ensure data integrity it

564
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,790
protects against malware and rootkits

565
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,669
only validated software components can

566
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,649
execute that makes it hard for us from a

567
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:28,110
forensic standpoint if we're looking at

568
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:30,550
boot loaders and that kind of thing

569
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,250
trusted boot validates firmware images

570
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,610
before they're allowed to load the OS

571
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:40,410
and all binaries must be signed by

572
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:43,830
to the authority and sock is also used

573
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:47,040
in addition before the devices boot so

574
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:52,010
they're using some of the same security

575
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:56,100
mechanisms as as Windows computers are

576
00:26:52,010 --> 00:27:00,270
they also use encryption BitLocker

577
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,449
technology use used so it's aes-128 to

578
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,830
protect all internal data once enabled

579
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,730
the phone automatically begins

580
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:11,639
encrypting internal storage and

581
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:14,549
encryption key is protected by TPM and

582
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:18,000
what Microsoft says basically is that if

583
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:22,129
you have a combination of the pin and

584
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,750
BitLocker in place your data is secure

585
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:30,419
and so I knew I had at least one of

586
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:33,120
those the early paperwork on Windows

587
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:36,419
Phone 8 from Microsoft also seemed to

588
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,689
indicate that if the phone was password

589
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,790
protected it was also encrypted but the

590
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,910
language was fuzzy

591
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:47,790
so while it kind of said that it didn't

592
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,650
say at what level you know who gets to

593
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,540
enable that encryption whether it's done

594
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:55,320
by an administrator or whether it's done

595
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,120
by the user on the device or where those

596
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,240
encryption keys are stored none of that

597
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,860
that good secret sauce was shared with

598
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,020
the public for I for good reasons right

599
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:10,229
the Windows Phone 8 supports the use of

600
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,360
extended memory on micro sd but only

601
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,090
allows for the storage of media files so

602
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,649
if I'm able to get to that micro sd card

603
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,000
the only thing I'm getting back is

604
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:23,220
pictures movies and music nothing else

605
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,470
and access to that stored data as we

606
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,100
talked about before is via MTP which

607
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,600
doesn't work if your passcode protected

608
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:37,199
you can tell I'm running against that

609
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:39,780
passcode with every option I look at the

610
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,840
operating system and user and data

611
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:46,740
partitions are encrypted this is what

612
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,760
the Microsoft documentation says I can

613
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,460
tell you

614
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,990
that when a pen is in place it doesn't

615
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,530
necessarily mean that the data is

616
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,630
encrypted because when I got to this

617
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,750
phone it was not as I was expecting to

618
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:03,030
get back from the JTAG extraction a

619
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:06,030
fully encrypted container after reading

620
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:09,780
this documentation but it was not

621
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,820
encrypted so so what they document and

622
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,550
what actually happens is not necessarily

623
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,399
the same you can wipe these devices

624
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,590
remotely or locally and if the incorrect

625
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,780
pin is entered too many times a local

626
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,810
wipe is initiated so I'm not going to

627
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:31,860
start poking on that keypad hoping to

628
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:35,370
get to the data yes it is by default

629
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:37,409
enabled and I think the number of times

630
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:42,899
is 10 but you can change that as the

631
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:46,740
user so for acquisition report sorry

632
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:48,210
acquisition support for Windows 7 are

633
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,180
our tools are getting a little bit

634
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:58,610
better there's logical support for

635
00:29:50,180 --> 00:30:01,110
images video from external cards by MTP

636
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:03,840
contact lists and call augs the tools

637
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:06,030
I'll do pretty well with for file system

638
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,300
extraction there's very limited support

639
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:12,060
by forensic tools cellebrite xry and

640
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:16,020
oxygen all claims some level of

641
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,240
filesystem support for Windows 7 and and

642
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,580
now Windows 8 devices but again this was

643
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,780
a year ago before they really got to

644
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,280
work on this and when you go in to get

645
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,129
that file system extraction that they

646
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,230
claim support for often times it goes

647
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,530
through the device acquires the micro SD

648
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,240
card and cells tells you here's your

649
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,070
file system extraction right which is

650
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,680
the same that we would get with a

651
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:44,610
logical extraction of those of those

652
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,350
items so for physical extraction which

653
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,459
is what I really needed in this case

654
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,889
JTAG or chip off are our only options at

655
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:54,870
least as of a year ago cellebrite now

656
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:58,550
supports physical acquisition of some

657
00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:01,620
Windows 8 Windows Phone 8 devices

658
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:04,080
forensic tools may provide some

659
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:08,879
in decoding and limit parsing of the raw

660
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:14,850
extraction I can tell you that I had

661
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:18,830
best luck with xry and nk7 once I got my

662
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:21,059
data extraction from from teal Tech so

663
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,220
again I went back to the traditional

664
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,889
forensic tools because the mobile tools

665
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,620
were we're behind and it's really not a

666
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,150
criticism of the mobile tools because it

667
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:33,959
does take them a lot of time to catch up

668
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,580
and and provide support for especially

669
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,429
these phones that aren't the top runners

670
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,139
in the market but it's it is frustrating

671
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,210
because if you're dealing with those

672
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,360
phones now it doesn't matter how much of

673
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,760
it Unicorn is we need some you know some

674
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:54,590
tools to attack it with I'm not

675
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:59,460
attacking unicorns I'm really not so

676
00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:02,100
JTAG extraction for those who aren't

677
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,350
aware of what JTAG is the

678
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,600
non-destructive process used to bypass

679
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,469
security measures and access the memory

680
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,500
of the phone directly this is just a

681
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,720
couple of years ago something that was

682
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:17,880
was only being done in a few labs and

683
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,470
was extremely expensive it's now

684
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,179
processed that sort of been democratized

685
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:28,020
so that with an investment of under

686
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,809
$5,000 and some training and good

687
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:33,360
problem-solving skills

688
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:36,299
you you can do it in your own lab so

689
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,279
JTAG extraction has really come into its

690
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,320
own and and teal technologies provides

691
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:43,380
really good training for them and this

692
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:49,320
is not a sales pitch but they're they're

693
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:52,799
sort of ahead in that area so what you

694
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:56,428
do is solder directly to the the

695
00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,620
maintenance ports and draw the data out

696
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:04,440
using software from the developer world

697
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,020
and then you get a raw data dump and

698
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,090
once you get that raw data dump you have

699
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,950
to do the work of rebuilding the file

700
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,949
systems and in figuring out what's in

701
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,260
that data the Windows Phone 8 operating

702
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,570
system is real

703
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:23,540
typically new it's not in super common

704
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:26,450
use even now I would say meperidine and

705
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,230
Android and the other thing I would say

706
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:34,700
is that as someone who's tried to

707
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:37,640
develop sets of data from a Windows 8

708
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,600
Phone it's very frustrating from it from

709
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:44,030
a user interface standpoint still so

710
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,939
I'll get to using it now go ok I'm gonna

711
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,379
build this exercise and I'll get into

712
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,670
the week and I'll go I'm so frustrated

713
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,980
I'm just gonna put that phone away it's

714
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,650
it's hard to stick with so it's it's not

715
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:04,190
it's it's kind of clunky from a user

716
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:06,140
interface standpoint so this is what

717
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,640
JTAG looks like what we're talking about

718
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,250
is taking the phone all the way apart

719
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:13,520
exposing that printed circuit board or

720
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:16,040
PCB and finding the correct ports to

721
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,050
solder leads to this is a better

722
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,290
documented process than it was certainly

723
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,500
a couple of years ago and there are

724
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:26,600
diagrams and things out there available

725
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,520
through through the trainers and through

726
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,889
some other sources so it's it's less

727
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,909
mysterious than it used to be and

728
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:36,169
getting less mysterious all the time

729
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,620
some of the common tools are the the

730
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:41,029
Rift box and the ATF box both of those

731
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:46,100
provide pretty good support for a lot of

732
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:48,710
models of Windows Phone 8 devices and if

733
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,360
you're looking for a quick set up I'm

734
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,310
not going to play the video but there

735
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,730
are videos out there online that'll walk

736
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:59,270
you through what JTAG looks like really

737
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:03,020
you end up soldering soldering those

738
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:06,140
those leads you connect it to a box we

739
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:08,390
connect the box to a computer and you

740
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,549
use software to pull it off

741
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,609
they now have a lot of different boxes

742
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:19,400
jigs and adapters different people have

743
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:21,320
different choices Bob Eldar is always a

744
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,910
good person to go to if you're looking

745
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,830
for information on JTAG he's our

746
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:30,029
forensic examiner

747
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,500
right this year but he has a lot of

748
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,450
great information and is willing to

749
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,700
share with people so this is what a rift

750
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:39,589
box looks like here is the software

751
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,589
interface that goes with the rift box

752
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,080
there are some things you have to really

753
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,310
worry about when you're dealing with

754
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,060
this and it doesn't show in this

755
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:50,279
particular screenshot but it's as easy

756
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,990
to wipe the data off of a phone with the

757
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,340
touch of a button as it is to pull the

758
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,520
data off of the phone with the touch of

759
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,320
a button so so really making sure you

760
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,300
know what's going to happen before you

761
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,310
before you click on something is

762
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,860
important when you're doing I this is

763
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,720
the ATF box you'll notice it comes in a

764
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,790
slightly different form factor kind of

765
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:19,319
like a dongle rather than a true box

766
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:21,240
although so these are not true forensic

767
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,840
tools these are you know developer and

768
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,810
manufacturer tools that have been sort

769
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:30,150
of co-opted by our community to do phone

770
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:36,750
forensics sometimes it's the only way in

771
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:39,750
though so it's good so a couple weeks

772
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,480
pass I get my data back I've got a time

773
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,130
clock clicking right I said to I had

774
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,970
about six weeks when the data went out

775
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:53,040
two weeks have passed I now have a month

776
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:55,830
to work with the data Maggie

777
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,180
Gaffney who works for the Massachusetts

778
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:00,890
State Patrol is the person who actually

779
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:04,109
did the extraction from my phone and

780
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:06,060
when she did the extraction she called

781
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:10,410
me in the middle of it and she said this

782
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:14,330
phone is just being a pain in the butt

783
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,330
she said different words than that but

784
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:20,190
and and she said you know I get it

785
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,920
started and it stops I get it started in

786
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,680
it stopped by the time she got this

787
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,830
started and completed the actual

788
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,700
extraction took 18 hours from beginning

789
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:37,380
to end so it was it was not an easy JTAG

790
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:39,129
process for her so so but she got me the

791
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,950
data she was persistent

792
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,910
happy about that so I get back a raw bin

793
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,669
file

794
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:48,790
it contains the full physical image of

795
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:51,160
the memory from the chip on the phone if

796
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:54,910
you load these your forensic tool may or

797
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,779
may not parse the file system and in my

798
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:00,790
case the forensic tool will just sort of

799
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,890
the three I used just sort of looked at

800
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:06,430
it and said I don't know what that is

801
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:08,379
you'll have to try something else so

802
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,859
celebrate didn't parse it oxygen in

803
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,890
parse it in X or Y didn't parse it X

804
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:19,390
ways however hold that data in and said

805
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:23,950
tada here's your file system and what it

806
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:27,670
gave me back was the screenshot that is

807
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:31,990
28 partitions okay already looking like

808
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:35,290
a strange animal right and you'll notice

809
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:37,810
that the bottom two partitions it's a

810
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,990
little bit light though but have the

811
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:45,940
vast majority of the data in them oh

812
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:48,939
she's given me the 5-minute signal so in

813
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,950
this case I used multiple tools X ways

814
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:55,450
and case celebrate IEF database viewers

815
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,330
anything I could including pythons

816
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:01,509
scripting and and the answer is to just

817
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:05,799
dive in and dig I used a lot of keywords

818
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:08,320
I use a lot of just just parsing through

819
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,530
the data looking for Strings and use

820
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,160
that to try to find what I needed to

821
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:20,610
find focusing on sort of the mobile

822
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:24,009
centric kinds of dates and times and

823
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:27,850
doing that I was able to find that

824
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:32,040
partition 27 is our system data 28 is

825
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:35,770
our user data you'll notice it says

826
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:39,880
28,000 and 69 users this is X ways there

827
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:41,500
are not 28,000 sixty-nine users so you

828
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,400
have to question what your tools are

829
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:50,260
telling you there are in fact 25 default

830
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:53,400
users on on a base model

831
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,720
phone your tools can give you

832
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,450
misinterpretations of the data there's

833
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,509
three important accounts public WP comm

834
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:06,790
services and deaf apps or predefined

835
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:09,400
apps user contains multimedia files in

836
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:13,930
this particular case that's that also

837
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,630
includes application data so that's

838
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:19,060
definitely important to my case

839
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:22,930
WP comm services is where you get all of

840
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:25,180
the phone type information stored at

841
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:28,660
ball is going to have your phone base

842
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:32,160
features SMS email contacts that contact

843
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:35,140
table has 131 columns in it it's crazy

844
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,839
phone which doesn't have a dot ball at

845
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:40,440
the end but is a database file it has

846
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,530
your call logs their ESC database files

847
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:52,720
and have that standard magic number

848
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:54,430
beginning at at the first fourth these

849
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,439
are the database layouts you're gonna be

850
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,540
able to find those on the presentation

851
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,970
so I'm not going to to go through the

852
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,860
whole thing so sometimes you get lucky

853
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:05,910
even if your last name is Murphy I had a

854
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,330
text message in here that says the code

855
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,180
0-1-0-3

856
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:12,610
the code for the phone really was zero

857
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:15,460
one zero three uh-huh

858
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,560
what I've gotten that with a keyword hit

859
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,810
I would not yeah he's he's steering

860
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,840
unbelievingly but yes the code actually

861
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,220
was zero one zero three so I was able to

862
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,020
get into this phone and actually take

863
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,740
pictures of stuff after I found it and

864
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:37,509
do verification it was totally awesome

865
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:39,040
and I want to Adrian Liang wrote a bunch

866
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:41,800
of scripts to help me through this data

867
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,740
he actually was a visiting scholar for

868
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,820
me and was scripting in my lab for me as

869
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,350
we were working on this case and text

870
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,690
messages are a little different but

871
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,460
literally the the picture of the gun

872
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:57,510
with a message that said this is what

873
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:02,440
I'm going to use tomorrow was in there

874
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:03,550
what do you think of that they're in

875
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,250
several pieces

876
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:11,320
you get the references to the to the

877
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:13,150
different images and you can see as you

878
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,910
walk through that the data is stored

879
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:18,400
differently but you can put it all back

880
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:23,049
together with the original text message

881
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,460
and then I'm gonna I'm gonna go forward

882
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,190
through this you guys will have access

883
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,840
to the presentation but I want to play

884
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:33,490
this video file because it's the smoking

885
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,530
gun so this this video was found in the

886
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,750
phone it happened after the time of the

887
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:43,780
assault you're gonna play it for me cuz

888
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:47,890
I can't click it from here there's a lot

889
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:53,560
of swearing if you click on the picture

890
00:42:47,890 --> 00:43:33,279
itself it'll go it should go it went

891

yesterday when we tested real I'm gonna

892
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,370
move forward these guys ended up not

893
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:43,830
going to trial after the evidence came

894
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:47,770
out of this phone they all confessed and

895
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:49,390
were recently sentenced this data set I

896
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,580
shared with celebrate and that's part of

897
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,009
why they're posting Windows they're able

898
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:57,460
to parse Windows Phone 8 files now so

899
00:43:54,010 --> 00:44:00,100
anyway thanks to all these folks they

900
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,850
really helped a lot and sometimes it

901
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:07,110
takes a team to get job done fast so

902
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:07,110
