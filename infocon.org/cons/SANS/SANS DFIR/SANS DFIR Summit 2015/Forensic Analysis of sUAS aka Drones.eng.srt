1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
thank you all very much for attending

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,689
there's a lot of material here I'm going

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,280
to scream through a lot of it however if

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,929
you've got any questions that are

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,469
relevant that you're going to forget

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:15,080
before the end of the session ask

7
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:17,369
otherwise hold till in this session um

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,390
15 years of search-and-rescue experience

9
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,210
is part of the reason i'm passionate

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,160
about UAVs i like mapping things i like

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,710
knowing where things are and UAVs are

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,660
also good for looking for people i'm

13
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,760
also a fixed wing and rotor pilot I have

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,730
flown helicopters I've flown fixed-wing

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,170
aircraft I get really irked when people

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,468
put other objects in the way of my

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,469
flight path I don't like dying so that

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,360
also informs a lot of stuff I am I work

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,390
for instant young I am incredibly

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,950
fortunate to work for them because after

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,510
doing incident response and computer

22
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,160
forensics and cyber security for them

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,530
for three years they are actually

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,739
letting me help lead our disruptive

25
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,920
technology practice I am doing UAVs for

26
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:03,690
a big for firm and I'm just incredibly

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,670
fortunate in that regard this is a kind

28
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,070
of informative joke there's a lot of

29
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,380
perceptions about what UAV pilots do and

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,908
don't do my wife when I started doing

31
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,770
this stuff about five months ago said

32
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,500
you're going to make a living flying

33
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,420
plastic toys and the answer is

34
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,130
essentially yes why is this relevant

35
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,930
there's a lot of data out there on how

36
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,270
big the UAV market is going to be over

37
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,970
the next five years it's all wrong we

38
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,100
don't know it's just such a disruptive

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,200
technology right now it's such a hot

40
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,789
market VCS or dumping money into it

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,100
vendors are popping up all over the

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,170
place we don't know some of the

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,869
interesting things though our that we're

44
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,619
most like it and create about 70,000

45
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,479
100,000 different jobs 10,000 DJI

46
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,829
phantom quadcopter 'he's which are the

47
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,770
ones you usually see in the news are

48
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,919
being sold every week that's a lot of

49
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,880
UAVs showing up in the US airspace and

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,399
other air spaces there's a lot of

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,679
illegal and inappropriate activity going

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,509
on with the UAVs you've seen it in the

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,000
news they've landed on the White House

54
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,310
lawn they've delivered drugs and cell

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,590
phones into prisons they have been on

56
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,100
the flight path at DP actually I other

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,470
things DF

58
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,870
lovefield they've been seeing over

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,470
Newark they have been crashing into

60
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,350
crowds I say all these things I want to

61
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:28,530
make a really clear point this is in the

62
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,390
minority of all the pilots the vast

63
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,240
majority of the people flying UAVs or

64
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,579
people like you myself they are flying

65
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,410
safely and legally this is a very very

66
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,290
small percentage of all the people out

67
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,060
there flying UAVs however there are a

68
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,549
lot of UAVs out there and so that's

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,130
still a significant percentage so this

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,810
is relevant for you all because law

71
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,720
enforcement is going to be investigating

72
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,510
these now regulations and law about UAVs

73
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,640
are all over the map and lacking FAA

74
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,010
regulation that clearly says what you

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,799
can and cannot do a lot of local

76
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,540
jurisdictions are passing their own laws

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,880
empowering local law enforcement to

78
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,290
actually do something with these UAVs if

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,030
you're in law enforcement is relevant if

80
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,790
you're in agriculture if you're in media

81
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:17,040
if you're in real estate all these

82
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,239
industries can be touched by UAVs it

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,980
will likely be relevant for you there

84
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,530
are a lot of anti-drone solutions out

85
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,260
there most of them are illegal in this

86
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,880
country you cannot Jam them you can

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,239
shoot them down with a shotgun in

88
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,890
Northern California don't advise that

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,660
because you can get charged for doing

90
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,049
other things there but you know it's an

91
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:43,170
option there's a whole other side of the

92
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,970
conversation about this I want to make

93
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,579
another thing really clear I am NOT

94
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,670
anti-drone in any way shape or form I

95
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,500
run a commercial UAV service company I

96
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,359
fly these two things because I enjoy

97
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,350
them I've got a lot of friends who fly

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,290
them I am anti stupid behavior I'm anti

99
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,320
illegal behavior if you put a UAV on my

100
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,000
landing pattern if you drop a UAV and my

101
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,459
wife's head I'm going to be very anti

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,020
you I want to make sure that all the

103
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,420
people that are investigating that sort

104
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,640
of incident have the tools the

105
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,589
techniques and the support they need to

106
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,529
properly investigate that incident

107
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,590
whether it's in the defense of a pilot

108
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,869
or to prosecute that pilot we need to be

109
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,940
able to gather accurate facts we all

110
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,840
need to be able to do this that's why

111
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,719
we're all here

112
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,250
that's what I'm here for so quick

113
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,889
terminology UAS this is there are RPAs

114
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,550
military term UAS is the more common

115
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,650
sort of us term it's an unmanned aerial

116
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,199
system emphasis on system and we'll come

117
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,270
back to that the UAV is the aerial

118
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:52,290
component the aerial vehicle of that

119
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,750
system it's a vehicle it's a vehicle for

120
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,580
technology it is not a disruptive

121
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,800
technology into itself it's empowering

122
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,900
other disruptive technologies it's

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,540
carrying sensors is carrying payloads

124
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,609
it's kind of like the NASA program NASA

125
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,830
empowered a lot of other things to

126
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,080
happen but it was not exactly these are

127
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,260
up to technology itself ground control

128
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,099
stations data links drones first-person

129
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,630
view all these are relevant I apologize

130
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:23,610
for the bad joke but a high altitude you

131
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:26,639
do DGI phantoms ten thousand a week they

132
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,110
are very common platform there what most

133
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,419
people will likely have to investigate

134
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,729
they also a really good demonstration

135
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,549
platform and that's why I'm using it it

136
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:39,020
has all the components of every other

137
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:41,220
system I fly and every other system that

138
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,609
even upped all the way to military it's

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,950
got all those components so what

140
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,070
physical evidence is available and I

141
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,050
apologize for the red on black I will

142
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,780
redo this slide at some point there's

143
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,430
coffee which is always important um

144
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,799
there are there's the ercoupe throne

145
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,450
button there's the aircraft itself the

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,669
aircraft has a camera or some other

147
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,889
payload sensor on it there's a battery

148
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,320
system that the radio controller there's

149
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:09,210
a Wi-Fi range extender there's a mobile

150
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,300
device and there's a laptop all of these

151
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,150
are relevant to what we are doing all of

152
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:19,289
these have digital evidence on them that

153
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,179
aircraft has a Linux embedded Linux

154
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,430
system on it that camera has another

155
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,050
embedded Linux system on it that Wi-Fi

156
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,490
range extender has another linux

157
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,220
embedded system well it's actually open

158
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,660
wrt s not embedded the battery actually

159
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,030
has an intelligent controller on it that

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,950
you can talk to you that dumb radio

161
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,169
controller it's as a standard RC radio

162
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,320
controller actually has firmware on it

163
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:41,549
that you can talk to the laptop is used

164
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,900
for maintenance for bill

165
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,420
for all the rest is sort of the business

166
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,909
operations and that mobile device is my

167
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,350
ground control station the trailers in

168
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,720
Nevada that they're using for flying

169
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,090
predators over a rock is a big ground

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,520
control station that mobile device is my

171
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,060
version of it even the commercial ones

172
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,909
are oftentimes flying on Android tablets

173
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,880
to very common mechanism for ground

174
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,370
control stations what the physical

175
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,800
evidence available is the drone itself

176
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,600
with a flight controller sensor on it

177
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,520
physical evidence there the ground

178
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,950
control station is a data link component

179
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,680
to that the radio controller there's a

180
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,110
lot of post processing technology

181
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,120
available also all these have digital

182
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,790
artifacts the mobile operating system

183
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,190
traditional operating systems a variety

184
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,670
of file systems all that media storage

185
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,530
ee prams and firmware i started looking

186
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:36,360
at jtag that's something I gotta go

187
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:39,059
learn a lot more about it's probably

188
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,150
relevant I didn't get into that there's

189
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,680
also a lot of other pieces to this and

190
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,140
this starts getting into sort of

191
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,150
commercial cyber security and commercial

192
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,270
investigations there's mission planning

193
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,620
it's still present in just in my own

194
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,510
one-person operation their maintenance

195
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,520
logs purchase records social media and

196
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,890
fingerprints all of these are relevant

197
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,510
when you're investigating crash or other

198
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:06,750
misuse of UAVs what's on the UAV itself

199
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,789
the main board has a CPU on it running

200
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,460
Linux in most cases there's a bunch of

201
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,920
esc s electronic speed controllers with

202
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,650
it also drive the LEDs they drive the

203
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,380
motors battery board and battery there's

204
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,810
a GPS and compass which are used for

205
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,270
flight control sensing there's a flight

206
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,190
controller with its own receiver tied to

207
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,740
it anti inference forward and then the

208
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,480
gimbal board drives the camera so all

209
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,260
this sort of stuff may be relevant to

210
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:37,050
your investigation keeping it all online

211
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,569
the UAV CPU and operating system the

212
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:44,490
flight controller is essentially the CPU

213
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,680
for a UAV it runs some form of software

214
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,260
on their think of that as the operating

215
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,880
system um there's a lot of open source

216
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,230
solutions and I did this a couple months

217
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,270
ago and they're more solutions out there

218
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,080
now and they're a bunch of commercial

219
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,960
solution

220
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,300
um there are essentially open sort well

221
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,680
it's not quite open source hardware but

222
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,079
you can buy a flight controller for

223
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,819
about 18 bucks now you can put that on

224
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,400
all sorts of stuff that you build up

225
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,260
yourself and you're ready to go air

226
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,660
where is a company out in Northern

227
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,840
California they are trying to be both

228
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,819
the Microsoft and the IBM of the UAV

229
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,410
world they want to sell you hardware the

230
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,850
software that runs on it and all the

231
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,709
other components to tie into that

232
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,450
there's a lot of other people trying to

233
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,060
do this as well including open-source

234
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,830
efforts Linux is the predominant

235
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,130
operating system that I'm seeing out

236
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,330
there on the UAV all of the ground

237
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,560
control stations stuff like that has

238
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,240
traditional operating systems for the

239
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,130
most part collection analysis workflow

240
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,080
most of us are digital forensic Gators

241
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,260
in some form or another this is highly

242
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,420
relevant you need to gather a lot of

243
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,510
information before you get started on it

244
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,709
look at all the pieces you've got

245
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,230
understand what they all are understand

246
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,370
how you're going to approach them all

247
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,710
some of these systems can be highly

248
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,840
customized there's open source software

249
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,880
out there and a lot of the ground

250
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,410
control station software that's used for

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,720
mission planning and things like that is

252
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,370
written by third parties not by the

253
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,450
vendors look at all those components

254
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,730
determine the problem you're trying to

255
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,860
solve are you doing an accident

256
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,910
investigation is it because somebody

257
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,850
used it for transporting illegal

258
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,469
materials is it a privacy complaint all

259
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,120
of these walls to help guide your

260
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,490
investigation and what evidence you want

261
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,510
to look at first and what evidence you

262
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,570
want to look at later these should be

263
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,840
fairly familiar to everybody in the room

264
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,510
the guiding principles know what you're

265
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,930
looking at as I said earlier it's a

266
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:44,160
vehicle you see a UAV it's like oh okay

267
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,959
I'm going to pick this up I'm good to go

268
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,790
I got everything it's got a lot of other

269
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,280
things inside of it you've got to be

270
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,490
prepared to go look at all those know

271
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,990
how to talk to all these components USB

272
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,140
connections all over some of these

273
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,800
things the DJI phantom you can use Wi-Fi

274
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,449
or Bluetooth other things use mavs link

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,160
if you actually start pulling the things

276
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,420
open you may need to use jtag and other

277
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,389
forms of

278
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,219
sort of deeper dive forensics know what

279
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:13,019
it's running make sure you've got the

280
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,740
tools analyze what these things are

281
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,850
running know what you're looking for

282
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,519
most of the time you're looking for

283
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,990
evidence of was this thing used for

284
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,250
legal activity where'd it come from

285
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,620
where'd it go so you're looking for

286
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,649
waypoints you're looking for where it

287
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,630
went to but you may be looking for

288
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,370
evidence of illegal payload was this

289
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,410
used to drop something does it have some

290
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,019
mechanism for lifting grabbing releasing

291
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,490
things like that you also may want to

292
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,320
say hey you look this thing flew 20

293
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,180
miles to get here and you look at the

294
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,769
battery it's only been used for ten

295
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,569
percent it's only been in the air for

296
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,730
five minutes there's no way it got here

297
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:55,589
from wherever you thought it got to hear

298
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:58,050
from document everything there's a form

299
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:59,940
up in my blog site which is a friends at

300
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,469
collection form for these things it

301
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,850
walks you through all the steps for what

302
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,040
you need to collect how to collect at

303
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,070
things like that if you got changes that

304
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,589
you want to see on it let me know um

305
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,269
photograph everything I always get a

306
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:14,940
whole stack index cards I put the date

307
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,290
time case number all that I put it down

308
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,300
in front of each element of what I'm

309
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,490
doing I take a picture of it that's my

310
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:23,130
photographic record take a picture of

311
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,500
the scene take a picture of the UAV as

312
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,029
it was when you found it take a picture

313
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,089
the ground control station as you found

314
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,110
it all these things are relevant if

315
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,570
you're law enforcement obviously

316
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,190
fingerprinted men only break all this

317
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,720
stuff down in your component parts and

318
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,149
make a plan for putting it all back

319
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,440
together in terms of the forensic story

320
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:44,910
you're trying to tell the most of the

321
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,970
rest is presentations I'm going to be

322
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,779
trying to tell a story we have a crash

323
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,819
drone or something it's on the lawn and

324
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,250
we don't know how it got there we want

325
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:58,349
to know the whole story of how it got

326
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,640
here why it was here and we want to work

327
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,680
it through the whole process so I'm

328
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,370
going to start us off with the crash

329
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,439
drone it was found in the front yard we

330
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,199
want to know who owns it we want to know

331
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,360
how it got here where it was before it

332
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,459
was crashed was it going someplace else

333
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,959
or was it coming here and what was its

334
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,279
purpose so this is the underside of a

335
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,319
DJI phantom 2

336
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,740
vision happens being underside of my DJI

337
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:29,189
phantom 2 vision on the upper part

338
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:31,470
upside down I apologize I label

339
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:33,300
everything so there's my user identified

340
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,639
label on there that's probably relevant

341
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,649
there's a model number on there that's

342
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,540
pretty useful there's a serial number on

343
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,459
there that's really reuse 'full I

344
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,990
haven't done any law enforcement cases

345
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,508
or civil cases where I've had a chance

346
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,189
to file a subpoena against DGI I would

347
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:49,079
really like an opportunity to find out

348
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:52,050
how they respond to such things if

349
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:55,109
anybody has a case involving DGI please

350
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,878
let me know I'd love to help you there's

351
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,059
also very other another and very

352
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,100
interesting artifact underneath that QR

353
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,790
code there's a series of letters and

354
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,629
numbers who can tell me what those are

355
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:13,399
five four three two one come on the mac

356
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:19,139
address why is there a mac address on a

357
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:21,600
UAV might it have a network on it it has

358
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,860
a network on it that's relevant by the

359
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,410
way if you look at that pre fax it comes

360
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:31,259
back to DG I that QR code is also rather

361
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,050
interesting that's what it expands out

362
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:36,300
to it's all right there in the string it

363
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,149
says it's made by DG I to phantom 2

364
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,969
gives you the mac address again if you

365
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:44,189
use that Mac if you use that URL on your

366
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,709
ground control station for the DG I

367
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:48,300
actually for the maintence station it

368
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:51,119
will go off and update your firmware and

369
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,829
do a lot of other things for you imagine

370
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,509
what you could do and I'm not

371
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,329
recommending you do this because it's

372
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:58,620
illegal if you fuzz that address what

373
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,180
other information could you find out

374
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,139
about the various people that are using

375
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,699
their products there's a whole but

376
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:09,629
there's three Linux systems that

377
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:12,540
involved EG i found this is common to

378
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:14,250
other platforms as well the Wi-Fi range

379
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,790
extender the sitting on the back of the

380
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,759
handheld transfer radio controller has

381
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,420
an IP address it has a known root

382
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:25,889
password it's running open wrt it's the

383
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,899
connection point for the ground control

384
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,000
station out to the Phantom ground

385
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,860
control station talks it it talks to the

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Phantom you now have a long distance

387
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,160
radio link out to your

388
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,770
anthem you can replace that with any

389
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,020
other wrt instance which means that if

390
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,180
you want longer range you can do that

391
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,130
you can also use it to hack into these

392
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,530
things and I'll get to that later the

393
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,510
camera has its own IP address and root

394
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,579
password there's not a lot to look at

395
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,310
there and then the general-purpose CPU

396
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,940
on the Phantom is running another linux

397
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:59,430
system and it remotely mounts I think

398
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,390
via NFS that cameras file system so

399
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,959
that's where all the images come from

400
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:06,210
you can talk to that via cr2 net and

401
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,980
we'll get to that as well the collection

402
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,320
steps are in here you basically ssh in

403
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,410
and you start using dumped pulled it

404
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,950
back i use brians live response tools to

405
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:18,810
pull our fax off of it as well they're a

406
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,750
bunch of gotchas about this file system

407
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,160
in this operating system first of all

408
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,310
there to file systems on there once

409
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,260
jffs2 and the other one it's sitting on

410
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,599
top of mt v device which i had to go

411
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,880
learn about I do not know everything I

412
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,530
wanted to know um basically dumped the

413
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,060
file system then you gotta bite swap it

414
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,220
before you can do anything with it it's

415
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,079
j ffs you got to go deal with that and

416
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,839
to actually put together the whole file

417
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,700
system for that whole cpu you got layer

418
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,700
it back on top of the other file system

419
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,650
all of these tool all the commercial

420
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,120
tools sorry all the sort of consumer

421
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,730
grade tools and many of the commercial

422
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,320
tools have SDKs published for them they

423
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,560
want to encourage people do cool things

424
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,850
with these platforms that means that you

425
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,688
can do cool things with these platforms

426
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,280
such as getting at data they were not

427
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,800
sharing all ready or not expecting to

428
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,569
share be prepared to do your own

429
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:20,669
development this is what I did I wanted

430
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,139
to know where this UAV came from one of

431
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,660
the things I pull back was the battery

432
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,730
supply remaining battery power so they

433
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,740
only you'd use twenty one percent of the

434
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,720
battery capacity been flying for about

435
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,630
eight minutes but the most important

436
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,510
thing is it had six satellites six GPS

437
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:40,170
satellite blocked and it tells me the

438
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,060
home location DGI and all the other

439
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:45,600
vendors strongly recommend and they even

440
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,800
automate having the UAV know where it

441
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,080
was launched from

442
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,669
because when you lose contact with it or

443
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,870
something else happens they wanted to

444
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:56,370
fly back to where it was launched from

445
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,379
if I find this thing sitting in my lawn

446
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,120
and the power still on it and I can pull

447
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,640
that information on it's like Oh plug

448
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,719
that into Google oh he's about a quarter

449
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,850
mile that way that's going to pick them

450
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,340
up or at least go talk to him so very

451
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:12,929
useful information the DJI naza flight

452
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,669
controller doesn't have a lot of onboard

453
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,170
data logging when you power the thing

454
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,300
off a lot of the information goes away

455
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:20,610
other flight controllers have a lot more

456
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,370
onboard processing some of it sticks

457
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,600
around some of it doesn't just keep that

458
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,300
in mind as you're looking at these

459
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,980
platforms the ground control stations

460
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,899
have a lot more of that telemetry data

461
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:35,400
and that's really where you're trying to

462
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,290
get to oops sorry so the answer answer

463
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,570
is often in the data we've got this home

464
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,970
location we can walk over and find that

465
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,710
home location let's go see what's over

466
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,890
there actually I'm getting ahead of

467
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:50,700
myself sorry on this platform there's

468
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:55,290
also a sensor in the cases DGI it's

469
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,540
usually a camera but I fly lidar for

470
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:01,200
doing mapping purposes standard optical

471
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:04,200
in dir actually mdv I is for doing crop

472
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,090
health thermal for doing pipeline

473
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,300
expections looking for missing persons

474
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,820
and you can fly a Wi-Fi range extender

475
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,530
over there if you want to go hat use it

476
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,710
to remotely hack into some buildings

477
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:19,649
Wi-Fi and extend their network out to

478
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,180
where you are the sensor data will tell

479
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:25,050
you a lot about the purpose of that

480
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:27,060
aircraft and where it's been the most

481
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:31,680
common optical sensors are the GoPros

482
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,030
the DJI own camera i fly canon s110 s

483
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,850
bunch of other people do that as well

484
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,870
for more mapping purposes the artifacts

485
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,429
that come off these things are very

486
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,520
traditional these are all familiar to

487
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:44,640
you it's the image and the XF data no

488
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,220
rocket science here the location of

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,040
where this thing has been is right there

490
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,640
on that UAV just pop the SD card out and

491
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:57,020
you've got it this is the exif data from

492
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,970
event phantom the vision to as I said

493
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,450
it's got the GPS latitude and longitude

494
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,700
right in

495
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,340
there it tells you where that picture

496
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,230
was taken unfortunately a DTI does not

497
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,149
record altitude so if you're trying to

498
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,550
prove that this thing was flying into

499
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,790
above 500 feet or something like that so

500
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,870
will it you cannot do it with this data

501
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,580
you can then just take this and plot it

502
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,439
you now know every single place one of

503
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,730
those pictures was taken you can plot

504
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,160
them in sequence you know its entire

505
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,250
flight path i can now defendant lee say

506
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,620
that this camera was over this location

507
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,990
at this point in time they could fudge

508
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,229
the exif data I admit so you got to go

509
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,160
look for that sort of evidence tampering

510
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,650
there's a whole bunch of the sensor data

511
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,330
that goes up in the cloud the whole

512
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,400
purpose of consumer drones is to make

513
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,010
yourself look cool on YouTube apparently

514
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,330
other people do other things with it but

515
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,310
that seems three where a lot of the

516
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,800
evidence comes from check out youtube

517
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,480
videos check out facebook check out all

518
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,300
these other things we already do this

519
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,940
from the mobile devices we already are

520
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,620
catching the bad guys or at least saying

521
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,060
hey look stop doing this bad behavior

522
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,209
because people are posting this

523
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,159
information this is not anything new use

524
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,580
your traditional techniques you'll get a

525
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,950
lot of results the commercial vendors

526
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,260
are doing the same thing if I'm flying a

527
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,330
UAV for two hours to go get crop health

528
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,910
data the farmer standing next to me

529
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:20,100
wants to know right now how healthiest

530
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,840
crops are a lot of these things are

531
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,120
uploading in real time to the cloud and

532
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,070
doing processing and bite on my land

533
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,169
they've got that data available for me

534
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:32,340
so keep all those in mind when you're

535
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:35,010
doing your investigation I did not stage

536
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,419
these shots everybody who's flying these

537
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,790
things wants to make sure the camera

538
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,830
works or they launch it they leave the

539
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:43,050
camera running and if you pull the SD

540
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,720
card out you'll find these pictures that

541
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:48,570
is my license plate you can go run my

542
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,640
plate and find out where I came to where

543
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,439
my car usually is where I who I am a lot

544
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,150
sort of stuff that's a picture of me

545
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,460
I've looked at a lot of other people's

546
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,900
imagery all coming off their cameras

547
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,580
they got pictures of themselves when

548
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,960
they're launching or landing it right

549
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,909
there so now we've got the launch point

550
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,370
what's at the launch point there's a

551
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,200
ground control station which is often a

552
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,209
mobile device tablet phone something

553
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,500
like that there are a lot of vendor

554
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,940
applications and

555
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,490
third party generated applications on

556
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,070
that phone they the vendor applications

557
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,330
are I won't say well written and I'll

558
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,070
give you an example that a minute and

559
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,230
the third party applications depending

560
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,760
on who wrote them range everywhere from

561
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,590
very well written to very poorly written

562
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,510
in terms of security a lot of

563
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,550
information in there what we're looking

564
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,770
for the default settings how do they

565
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,930
want to fly this thing where it was

566
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,700
launched when it was launched owner's

567
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,410
name account information a lot sort of

568
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,910
stuff there's a bunch of other

569
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,950
information that's at that launch point

570
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:46,980
if you pull my vehicle part you'll find

571
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,200
two laptops three UAV the whole bunch of

572
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,950
batteries all sorts of other evidence

573
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,680
that may be a potential use to you this

574
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:59,460
is the standard DJI phantom application

575
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,250
if you pull it apart you've got a table

576
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,250
in there SQL light table that's got a

577
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,170
bunch of ID's the flight time latitude

578
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,460
and longitude the flight time is a

579
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,320
little misleading and actually turns out

580
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,030
to be the launch date of that the

581
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,179
latitude and longitude are correct you

582
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:17,070
plot those you now know every place

583
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,100
where I turn on that application and

584
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,810
connected it to a DJI phantom you now

585
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,280
know where I've been some of those

586
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,899
locations I probably should not have

587
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,490
been and I picked that I moved from that

588
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,200
data around so some of those places I

589
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,690
definitely should not have been um I

590
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,210
just made those up the other thing off

591
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,390
that ground control station off that DJI

592
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:40,410
phantom application is the path to this

593
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:42,480
P list and my email account the email

594
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,450
account like many other vendors they're

595
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,750
using that as my username my passwords

596
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,030
in there for that website that passwords

597
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,650
in the clear you now have that

598
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:56,610
information this is the vendors

599
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,870
application this is not some third party

600
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,370
developers just trying to put together

601
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,709
something cool this is the vendor doing

602
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,330
this stuff it also says I was running in

603
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,520
ground control the ground station mode

604
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,540
and I was not doing the first person

605
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,070
view with that account information my

606
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:13,050
own account I don't have a subpoena I

607
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,210
don't need a subpoena I can pull my

608
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,090
shipping address I can show how much I

609
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,410
paid for it a bunch of other information

610
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:20,699
people buy these things from amazon and

611
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:25,050
lots of other places it's not always

612
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,450
going to be this easy sometimes it is so

613
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:30,840
we went from the crashed UAV

614
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,600
to where it was launched from now we're

615
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,418
at home or now we're at the office what

616
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,699
information is there we have flight

617
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,919
mains and maintenance logs did this

618
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,889
person properly maintained their UAV if

619
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,799
you are flying commercially and you FAA

620
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:48,178
is voluntary compliance right now if you

621
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
are complying with them there's a lot of

622
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,950
stuff you need to do on a regular basis

623
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,779
that information should be there they

624
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,860
should will likely have in some form or

625
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,500
another a lot of information about

626
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,449
previous flights they will pull their

627
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,429
own injury off from a flight they did

628
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,320
three weeks ago that information is

629
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:05,549
there they're gonna have client

630
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,139
accounting data this is all the

631
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:08,700
traditional stuff that we will find when

632
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:11,189
investigating somebody with a laptop

633
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,519
that was used illegally the UAVs just

634
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,779
another example of a vehicle for illegal

635
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,720
or malicious activity you can

636
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:22,230
investigate it in a similar manner the

637
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,700
data analysis system initially people

638
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,889
doing a lot of data crunching on their

639
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,750
own platforms it requires a lot of CPU

640
00:25:25,889 --> 00:25:29,699
and a lot of memory most of this is

641
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,320
getting done the cloud now that said

642
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,200
most of us still pull the data off of

643
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:37,200
our UAVs and store it locally so that

644
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,970
should be there they're also a whole

645
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,380
bunch of other UAVs sitting at home

646
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:46,549
spare parts and things like that we have

647
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,830
a drone in flight it's hovering over you

648
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:51,090
can we do anything about it you can

649
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,960
shoot it down with a shotgun that's

650
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:56,850
somewhat disruptive it's come on illegal

651
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,679
doing some things like that we would

652
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,629
like to know who's flying it we would

653
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,539
like to know where it's going we'd like

654
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,610
to know what it's collecting you can do

655
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:11,340
real-time analysis on some of these

656
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:14,519
platforms even this is illegal I'm doing

657
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,668
it as my own how you use it up to you if

658
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:20,700
you get into that open wrt system is

659
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:23,610
sitting on the back of the radio

660
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:26,760
controller you can now SSH out to the

661
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,260
flight controller and using search and

662
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,639
net you can talk to everything on there

663
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,379
somebody else did all the work on this

664
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:34,469
I'm just you know we using their

665
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,629
material they figured out some of the

666
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,940
commands you can issue you can ask it

667
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,809
for a status most important you can ask

668
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,970
it where home is so

669
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:45,549
instead of having to develop that app

670
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,159
that I did I can just go talk to this

671
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,929
thing in flight and say where is your

672
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,549
launch point so it's hovering over me it

673
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:53,200
says I came from over there I walk over

674
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,879
there there's a guy holding a flight

675
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,919
controller that flight controllers

676
00:26:54,879 --> 00:27:01,748
paired to that phantom we're essentially

677
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:04,330
good to go you can hijack these things

678
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:05,740
in real time so I don't have to be

679
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,639
standing next to the guy with the open

680
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,090
wrt range extender I can cause that DJI

681
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:17,258
phantom in flight to d off I can have my

682
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:19,570
own wrt range extenders set up with a

683
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:21,909
directional antenna so I've got the

684
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,889
strongest singer strongest signal

685
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:25,869
pointing out of that phantom and it will

686
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:28,570
retry to re-authenticate it should we

687
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:30,129
authenticate to me now I've got the

688
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:31,720
real-time connection to it they still

689
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:33,939
have the radio controller they should be

690
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,340
able to go landed themselves by taking

691
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,619
control over it my suspicion is that

692
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,029
there's probably some way to send a

693
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,678
command that thing to tell it to even to

694
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:46,299
ignore the radio controller I haven't

695
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,950
gone that far yet there is a tool out

696
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:49,960
there called sky Jack and somebody wrote

697
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:54,100
a couple years ago designed for parrot

698
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,019
AR drones it will hijack them this sort

699
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:01,418
of approach will likely work on a lot of

700
00:27:56,019 --> 00:28:02,950
other platforms as i said the Phantom's

701
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:04,179
one of the more common platforms out

702
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,090
there is actually the most common

703
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:09,399
problem out there these techniques apply

704
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,309
to a lot of other platforms and some of

705
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,379
them are a lot easier the pics hawk

706
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:16,600
flight controller is one of the more

707
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:21,908
common flight controllers that are used

708
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:24,248
in a lot of other platforms it works

709
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,690
with most most often it works with an

710
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,119
open source package called mission

711
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,619
planner those three dr's coming out with

712
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,850
some custom applications and a lot of

713
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,820
other people are now talking to it more

714
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:37,090
directly it downloads a lot of data as

715
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,769
it goes to put together that map I

716
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,360
showed you of all the images earlier

717
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:41,499
took me about an hour and a half I had

718
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,289
to go write some scripts a bunch of

719
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:46,960
other stuff I can generate this plot of

720
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:48,639
where that UAV was in about two minutes

721
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,929
using mission planner the data is right

722
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:52,029
there and it knows I want to plot it

723
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,010
shows me altitude location all the rest

724
00:28:52,029 --> 00:29:02,890
of it overlays in the top of a Google

725
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:04,780
much easier this is a lot allometry log

726
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:10,570
of one of my flights in my fixed-wing

727
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:16,960
UAV anybody in here a pilot so what's

728
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:20,080
pitch pitch this is the record of the

729
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,810
last 15 seconds of the pitch telemetry

730
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,300
from a fixed-wing UAV prior landing I

731
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,800
had it straight and level for a while I

732
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,960
was trying to get lined up for my

733
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,070
landing it's looking at I'm basically

734
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,560
flying it and then it's coming back

735
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,419
towards me I level everything out we're

736
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,790
good to go we're just cruising right in

737
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,030
about 10 feet off the ground life is

738
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:42,580
good all of a sudden pitches down

739
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:46,840
horribly and then it pitches right back

740
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,760
up I ran into a chain-link fence I was

741
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,100
completely focused on the aircraft and

742
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,379
it's like completely missed as

743
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,209
chain-link fence runs into it pitches

744
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,890
way down hits the ground bounces back up

745
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,170
it's now level that's what that is

746
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,470
there's an enormous wealth of data in

747
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,690
these aircraft these things were the

748
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,670
original you consumer UAVs were put

749
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,620
together by a bunch of hackers who are

750
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,390
flying radio control aircraft and said

751
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,989
hey let's see if we can automate this

752
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:16,480
stuff to balance out the four props on a

753
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,820
quadcopter takes a lot of computing

754
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,680
power and if everything is not quite

755
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,060
right they fall out of the sky they've

756
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,880
instrumented the heck out of these

757
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,010
things the data is in there you can tell

758
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,000
a lot about why things happen by looking

759
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,920
at the data and knowing what you're

760
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,730
looking at you think this does not apply

761
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:36,430
to a standard UAV investigation but it

762
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:38,830
might why did it crash in the lawn did

763
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,230
they intentionally crash it there or did

764
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,360
something in the system fail which you

765
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:47,620
can tell by looking at the logs and it

766
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,479
accidentally crashed there it also sort

767
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,939
of cords a lot of parameters much easier

768
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,650
to find this is only a fraction of them

769
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:55,420
you can tell a lot about how it was

770
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,810
configured that tells you a lot about

771
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,870
its purpose I'm not going to get done

772
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:04,450
early I apologize um there are a lot of

773
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,860
challenges and solutions going forward

774
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,650
DJI phantom has been around for a while

775
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,959
they've moved off a why

776
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:12,600
why they're now going to bluetooth other

777
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,720
people are going to LTE other cellular

778
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,129
technology for controls this closes down

779
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,960
some opportunities and create some other

780
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:23,370
opportunities and I'll give you

781
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:27,030
something of a if you can control a UAV

782
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:29,010
via cell signal how easy will it be for

783
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:32,940
you to track that UAV back to the

784
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:35,760
original pilot person flying and how

785
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,110
long range can that be if I'm getting

786
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,740
all the telemetry back from a that says

787
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:43,439
ok I'm now 20 miles that way that's all

788
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,380
I need to know to hit fly it so the

789
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,460
range of these things is to is

790
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,260
phenomenal and people been hacking

791
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,450
together long-range solutions but as we

792
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,670
go into cellular controls and things

793
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,040
like that and get much much longer range

794
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:58,490
much more capable there are a lot of

795
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,540
vendors a lot doing their own thing

796
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,690
there are a lot of people doing custom

797
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,580
work there's a wide range of operating

798
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,650
systems out there the rot wide range of

799
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,070
platforms it's not just windows linux

800
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:13,950
and what's the third vendor oh wait

801
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:17,490
Apple um there's a lot of other things

802
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,290
out there focus on the ground control

803
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,450
station the UAVs got a lot of cool stuff

804
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,970
on it but a lot of them if you power it

805
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,620
off you lose a lot of data some of it

806
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,080
may require jtag and as I said I've got

807
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,239
to get into doing that there is the the

808
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,340
sensor data on that platform pull that

809
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,410
look at it but a lot of your information

810
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,120
about what was going on why was going on

811
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,940
things like that is on the ground

812
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,129
control station you do not need to do

813
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,740
much different to go investigate those

814
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,630
that are running on mobile devices we

815
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:48,330
know how to investigate those they're

816
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:51,690
running off of laptops running Linux OS

817
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:54,270
X windows we know how to investigate

818
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:56,970
those there is no rocket science at that

819
00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:02,670
point you all can go do this stuff right

820
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:05,400
now some more forensic mostly law

821
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,080
enforcement approach things the UAVs are

822
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,600
paired with two different devices

823
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,550
they're paired with that wireless range

824
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,830
extender or some other data link

825
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:17,970
component and they're paired with that

826
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:21,419
radio controller if you need to go to

827
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:23,730
court and say I know that this UAV

828
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,890
believe with great degree of certainty

829
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,380
that this UAV was operated by this

830
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,730
person and you can show that that UAV

831
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,650
was paired with this flight controller

832
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:33,180
this radio controller that has my

833
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,570
fingerprints on it it's going to help

834
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:40,220
you make your case use traditional

835
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,220
processes they should work for you I

836
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:46,920
just said you all can do this you all

837
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:48,960
can do it but there's no one tool that's

838
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,180
going to help you get the job done this

839
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,780
is not push button forensics you cannot

840
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,490
plug the image into X ways or n case or

841
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,790
anything else out there and get all of

842
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:02,970
it done to go analyze this one platform

843
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:04,320
and justice one platform I had to deal

844
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,290
with three different versions of Linux

845
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,830
two of which were unfamiliar to me I had

846
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,699
to go look at iOS and Android which were

847
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,440
relatively I mean I'm familiar with

848
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,199
using them but analyzing was relatively

849
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,900
new to me OS X and Windows one of the

850
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,668
other usually six different file systems

851
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:23,220
at last count I kind of did lose track

852
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:25,440
I'd seen jffs2 before because playing

853
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,629
with some android stuff MTD was

854
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,100
relatively new to me layering one on top

855
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,500
of the other was completely new to me

856
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:34,290
how to go figure that one out cr2 net

857
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,679
this is serial to network it's a very

858
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:40,080
cool technology but it was began very

859
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,668
new to me why there's also two blue a

860
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,650
data link stuff that needs to be dealt

861
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:45,540
with you gotta pay attend to that XF

862
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:47,610
data I knew about GPS I knew about

863
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,259
there's a lot of social media analysis

864
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:53,250
you may need to do and their SDKs I

865
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,260
strongly recommend if you need to get

866
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:58,110
into this sort of stuff do your research

867
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,630
on the net all this stuff the bits and

868
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,460
pieces of this are all out there some of

869
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,930
it I had to go create myself but a lot

870
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,050
of it was based on research that other

871
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:09,930
people are doing take your time be

872
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,510
methodical work with people talk to me

873
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,359
talk to each other and together we can

874
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:22,110
all go solve some of these complex

875
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:26,610
solutions UAVs do not exist in a vacuum

876
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:28,590
if you want if you need to do or want to

877
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,700
do UAV forensic analysis you're still

878
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:34,170
not existing in a platform in a vacuum

879
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,180
there's a lot of cybersecurity issues go

880
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,090
around these things

881
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,919
these are unmanned aerial systems if you

882
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:44,790
want to plug these into your environment

883
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,970
be you a solo operator orbit you a large

884
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:51,270
commercial venture please think about

885
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:52,589
the larger cybersecurity issues a lot of

886
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,410
vendors are rushing these things to

887
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:59,970
market the cyber security controls in

888
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:02,160
them are immature in many cases that's a

889
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,680
benefit to us as forensic investigators

890
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,868
it's not a benefit to anybody trying to

891
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,790
use these things commercially think

892
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:12,440
about the intellectual property and

893
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:15,330
where that intellectual property resides

894
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,160
again that benefits you as a forensic

895
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,020
investigator the intellectual property

896
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,270
in that case is where the data is going

897
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,430
to help me make a case from a cyber

898
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,800
security perspective is where is the

899
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,980
data that somebody is going to go try to

900
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,960
steal from me I believe a lot of thats

901
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:34,650
in the imagery and a lot of that imagery

902
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,840
is up in the cloud if that UAV is flying

903
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,970
around over your crops or your mind site

904
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,530
or whatever it happens to be and we

905
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,020
laying in real time nine injuries a

906
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:49,609
cloud where are the credentials for

907
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:51,960
logging into the cloud on the UAV if

908
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:54,150
somebody can hack into that UAV in

909
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,590
flight do you believe they can get your

910
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:01,230
cloud credentials probably if they can

911
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:04,619
hijack your UAV so they may hijacking

912
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:07,470
you ate your UAV may get them one

913
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,710
snapshot of the data if they can hijack

914
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:13,950
your UAV and let you return it to home

915
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:16,080
and you don't know it got modified they

916
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:18,689
now have essentially persistent access

917
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:22,380
into the data you're collecting here's

918
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,910
another point are we flying UAVs to

919
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:28,230
collect imagery over things that we do

920
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:30,720
not find valuable what are we flying

921
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,119
them over we're flying them over new

922
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,189
construction sites we're flying them

923
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,990
over test crops what we're trying to

924
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,990
determine which one of these crops is

925
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:43,830
most suitable to this environment we're

926
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:45,569
flying them over the racetrack where

927
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,650
we're doing the test of our new Ferrari

928
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,020
or whatever it happens

929
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:50,340
to be we're flying over all these things

930
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,280
are of interest to us either as

931
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,970
individuals or commercial entities we

932
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,300
are self selecting that data and we are

933
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,379
uploading that all into cloud solutions

934
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:04,170
some of those cloud solutions are really

935
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,610
well designed some of them are but if I

936
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:09,990
wanted to go find out about all of the

937
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,580
critical infrastructure gas pipelines

938
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,970
high transmission lines and things like

939
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,250
that and the current health of them and

940
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,480
I know that this utility company is

941
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:22,860
uploading their data to this particular

942
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,140
cloud solution am I going to go break

943
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,390
into their facility and pull their maps

944
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,920
I can just go get the data they

945
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,660
collected last week and this applies to

946
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,700
crops that applies all sorts of other

947
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,000
things if I want to go hack into sony

948
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:39,089
pictures again they're flying UAVs to

949
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,400
collect I mean you AV is a beautiful

950
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,590
aerial platform for producing movies

951
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,400
it's one of the groundbreaking things

952
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:49,470
for a lot of those things where are they

953
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,760
storing that I don't know the answer but

954
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,819
if somebody's interested can go find

955
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,100
that out the final thing I want to make

956
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:01,410
a point of is again UAVs or a vehicle if

957
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:04,170
you are involved in lawmaking your local

958
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,089
jurisdiction or national stage if you're

959
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,250
involved in policy or you're just

960
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:11,880
talking to people let's keep something

961
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:14,220
in mind if I fly a UAV over your yard

962
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:24,360
and take a picture am I invading your

963
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:26,250
privacy legally no why should you pass a

964
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:30,030
law against a UAV flying over your

965
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:32,640
property it's a UAV violating your

966
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,320
product is it is making a law against

967
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,750
that UAV flying over your property going

968
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,330
to really fix a problem we need to

969
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,040
address the policy in terms of the risk

970
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,049
not in the technology that's

971
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,430
demonstrating that risk I can fly a

972
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,220
helicopter over your property and take

973
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,779
the same imagery and if you wrote the

974
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,819
law against if you wrote the policy or

975
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,130
law against the UAV you haven't solved

976
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,230
the problem they are a vehicle they may

977
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:58,020
have all sorts of them payloads on it go

978
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:00,090
solve the problem of the payload go

979
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,100
solve the problem of the purpose

980
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:04,320
go solve the problem of the societal

981
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:08,310
issue that you're trying to raise don't

982
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:13,280
write law or policy outlawing uavs look

983
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:18,540
at the larger problem I think that yep

984
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:21,600
this is me um you can reach me at my

985
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,870
gmail account I'm also first name dot

986
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,000
last name at ey com i'm also on twitter

987
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,580
I'm happy to help you all out with

988
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,860
anything it i'm literally very

989
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,420
interested in abling other people i'm

990
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,430
not trying to take make money off this

991
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,890
thing i'm trying to make sure that if

992
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:39,029
you are working on UAVs and law

993
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,400
enforcement and private practice

994
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,590
wherever that you've got the right tools

995
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,900
and technologies that you need to be

996
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,190
successful I'm also very interested in

997
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,960
hearing from people who are running into

998
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,790
these problems out there I know in my

999
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,410
heart and I know from some private

1000
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,240
conversations I knows from some other

1001
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,520
sources that some of this bad stuff

1002
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,200
going on but the more information we can

1003
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,300
share and I'll keep it private or

1004
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,210
anonymous however you want the better

1005
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,700
off we all are in terms of this and a

1006
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:12,900
lot of the other things that we do any

1007
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:14,759
questions yes DGI phantoms runabout

1008
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,990
thousand dollars and that's fully

1009
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,000
capable you can get a lot of other

1010
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,580
things for about five hundred dollars

1011
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,250
what you want is something that has the

1012
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,710
ability to fly autonomously and has some

1013
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:27,960
sort of sensor platform on it DGI just

1014
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:32,510
happens to be very stable 3d are also

1015
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,510
make some really good stuff sir

1016
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,620
we are the law and policy going that the

1017
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,720
all the activity I see in that arena is

1018
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:06,359
based on fear uncertainty and doubt and

1019
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,410
that is being fed by that very small

1020
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,330
percentage of people who are doing

1021
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,190
stupid things they are flying over

1022
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:13,350
crowds or flying into the flight path of

1023
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,660
commercial airliners they are flying

1024
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,279
multiple times in two wire wildfires in

1025
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,640
Northern California shutting down air

1026
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,280
ops these things are happening and the

1027
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,930
way that our political system and

1028
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,970
international political systems respond

1029
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:29,970
to these things is let's just pass a law

1030
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:32,009
against it the best we can do is try

1031
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,120
that you know we can do grassroots stuff

1032
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,240
but the other thing we can do is try to

1033
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:38,160
get out there and influence that I

1034
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:41,100
believe that there is some hope that the

1035
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,140
FAA will say that everything below 400

1036
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,299
feet is essentially no man not no man's

1037
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,850
land but consumers can fly in that air

1038
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,320
space as lawns are flying safely with it

1039
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,810
and they will not require a whole lot of

1040
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,370
regulation I believe that commercial air

1041
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:57,840
operations will require a new type of

1042
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:59,670
certification on a normal pilot's

1043
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,040
license recurring training things like

1044
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,970
that I believe that the FAA is going to

1045
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,990
do the right thing the question is

1046
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:09,390
whether local state and national privacy

1047
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,580
laws and things like that will be done

1048
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,009
right I have doubts I'm already seeing a

1049
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:16,640
lot of local laws that are badly written

1050
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,640
unfortunately

1051
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,390
it sucks to a couple reasons it sucks

1052
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,279
because you just bought one and you want

1053
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,779
to go do it but it's also really not

1054
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,860
helping the public think to the

1055
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,500
government's looking out for their best

1056
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:33,580
best interests because I'm part of the

1057
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,730
prongs we don't have a lot of good data

1058
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,170
we don't know I mean I know that the

1059
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,970
vast majority of people are flying

1060
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,790
safely but we don't have data to support

1061
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:44,740
that and the FAA has not put together

1062
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,840
any sort of process we have this for

1063
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,100
commercial in general aviation we have

1064
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,690
some idea of how many flights are

1065
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,190
executed how many crashes all that sort

1066
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,010
of stuff we don't have any of that data

1067
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,330
for uavs we will get there but we're

1068
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,860
going to get there because somebody can

1069
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:58,960
pass regulations requiring and those

1070
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,550
going to be draconian rather than hit

1071
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,470
let's start with the easy stuff and then

1072
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:05,410
see what else we need to fold into it so

1073
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:09,310
very good question and for asking a

1074
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:11,430
really good question boom sorry anything

1075
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,430
else

1076
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:32,920
um most of the imagery is almost always

1077
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:35,288
saved on the UAV and transmitted either

1078
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,930
down to the ground control station or

1079
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:39,400
out to the cloud that data link is not

1080
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,229
redundant by any stretch of imagination

1081
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,059
that ground control station is not

1082
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:44,710
redundant most of these are designed to

1083
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:45,910
fail somewhat safe so if they lose some

1084
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:53,999
piece of it they're supposed to return

1085
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:53,999
to home in Auto land yes

1086
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:00,160
that's where that data came from earlier

1087
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,530
and the challenge here is that they're

1088
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,580
making these SDKs available and so all

1089
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,880
sorts of people running all sorts of

1090
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,259
applications so there's a lot of

1091
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,460
information in there but you gotta go

1092
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,140
look at each application to figure out

1093
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:19,510
hey here's where the information may be

1094
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:21,640
but exactly and there that that's why

1095
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,960
i'm saying you know the UAVs got the

1096
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,940
exif data on there and things like that

1097
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,650
but the wealthy informations to be on

1098
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,080
those ground control stations because

1099
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:33,310
they want to monitor a lot of different

1100
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,840
variables for improving their product

1101
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:36,340
and a lot of these things are written

1102
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,940
very poorly so they just collecting

1103
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:42,370
everything and storing it there and

1104
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,020
that's I believe they're out there I

1105
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:46,810
know they're on the phone in many cases

1106
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,730
and I believe that for the data services

1107
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:53,040
there's a good chance that they are on

1108
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,040
the UAV in an insecure manner

1109
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,859
a lot of these things are embedded and

1110
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:06,900
they don't have a lot i'm so yeah I

1111
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:10,109
can't change them but the vendors have a

1112
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,240
challenge changing them because the the

1113
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:13,828
the DG I stuff has been out there for a

1114
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,459
couple years they still haven't changed

1115
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:20,040
it so it's a real problem I believe that

1116
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,530
the I don't think there's a lot of

1117
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,730
hoping the consumer side of things they

1118
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,559
want to get the cheapest possible

1119
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,660
product out there you know at the

1120
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,640
highest possible price point so they can

1121
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,470
make money off of it I think in the

1122
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,150
commercial space partly due to

1123
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,270
regulation but also partly due to

1124
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:38,130
educating taking the knowledge that we

1125
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,839
have about what good cybersecurity

1126
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,270
practices are for the enterprise and

1127
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,770
applying that to UAVs that they're going

1128
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:46,470
to get there all it's going to take a

1129
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,270
somebody hijacking you know some thirty

1130
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,520
thousand dollar UAB with a bunch of

1131
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,930
intellectual property on board for that

1132
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,549
sort of stuff to start getting out there

1133
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,308
I've already been talking to some

1134
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:57,960
companies they do get it whether the

1135
00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:00,839
vendors are keeping up with them yet or

1136
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,339
not we're saying there's still this

1137
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,710
enormous amount of competition and I

1138
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:06,990
don't think anybody's really

1139
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,579
prioritizing cybersecurity as being a

1140
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,029
way of differentiating themselves yet

1141
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:14,099
they're more look at endurance

1142
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:16,020
reliability payloads and thing like that

1143
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:18,329
they'll get there um if they would start

1144
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,530
choosing some good existing technologies

1145
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:21,210
for like data links that would help a

1146
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:22,880
lot and so that's why going to cellular

1147
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,970
may help with some of those things

1148
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,970
anything else

1149
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,240
it depends a lot on the DG I as far as I

1150
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:40,830
can tell almost all the information goes

1151
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,509
away when you lose power as you move up

1152
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:43,740
in the ecosystem there's a lot more

1153
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:46,500
retention because they're looking for

1154
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:47,850
fault tolerance um the DJI doesn't have

1155
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,190
a lot of on-board storage except for

1156
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:52,350
that SD card the SD card is really for

1157
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:56,840
the imagery that SD card is really the

1158
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:56,839
persistence mechanism for that aircraft

1159
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,910
that that in that particular case that

1160
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,400
cards only wiped when you intentionally

1161
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,049
wipe it it's just I said it's a standard

1162
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,820
camera with an SD card in it and that's

1163
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:12,920
why we can use standard techniques on it

1164
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,660
with the pics Hawk flight controller um

1165
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,070
things are a little bit different I'm

1166
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,109
still working on figuring out exactly

1167
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:21,530
what persists after we lose power on

1168
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:24,050
that but a lot of that information if

1169
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:27,800
all you've got is that UAV your best

1170
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:29,180
bets that imagery if it's a DJ I fast

1171
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,040
and ur DJI phantom you're not gonna get

1172
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,950
a whole lot off of the dead the power

1173
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,930
down consistent on there as you move up

1174
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:37,430
that ecosystem if you run into something

1175
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:39,140
let me know but I believe that there are

1176
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,799
going to be better persistence

1177
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,470
mechanisms I got like two minutes

1178
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:49,030
anything else hey I got two mins extra

1179
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,029
cool thank you all very much for coming
