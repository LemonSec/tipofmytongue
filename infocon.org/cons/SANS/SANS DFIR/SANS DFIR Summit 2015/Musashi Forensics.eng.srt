1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:07,109
some of you may be familiar with

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,559
miyamoto musashi he was a Japanese

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:13,889
swordsman in the 15 and 1600s not this

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,410
guy this guy he wrote the book of five

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,259
rings which is about the way of strategy

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,050
now in infosec many of us have no

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,710
strategy at all or if we do it's to be

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,720
stuck in a rut but not this kind of rut

9
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,000
this kind of rut we're stuck in a rut in

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,308
our job our career we don't seem to be

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
moving forward there's no opportunities

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,250
or options available to us and so we

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,070
become apathetic discouraged

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:46,019
disillusioned disenfranchised disgusted

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:49,500
disgruntled frustrated maybe even angry

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,129
and we blame the job we blame the

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,219
company we blame the career the industry

18
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:59,849
society or even the government after all

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,109
they're spying on us right so we get to

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,099
a point where we're fed up and

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,770
frustrated and we just jumped ship

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,530
looking for something else not always in

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,960
a good way but there's a distinct and

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,170
subtle problem with our approach with

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,570
our lack of strategy in this area and

26
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,140
that is that in infosec we have this

27
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,529
really bad tendency when we jump ship to

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,619
do so to the exact same job just in a

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,030
different company now we justify it we

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,619
say it's a different company it's a

31
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,479
different title there's different roles

32
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,869
and responsibilities that go along with

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,960
it and to an extent that's true but it's

34
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,670
also not true we end up still being

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,158
frustrated because we didn't actually

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,930
change anything we didn't get to the

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,659
root cause of the issue as important as

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,170
we know that is and we didn't change

39
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,680
anything with our overall status the rut

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,850
goes on forever and the party never ends

41
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,500
so we get to a point that we're so

42
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,390
frustrated and fed up that we quit the

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,850
industry as a whole we say that we're

44
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,788
burnt out and we just need to take a

45
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,209
break from infosec so we look for

46
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,929
something else to do we look we try but

47
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,269
really the problem

48
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,120
is part of Newton's laws and that is

49
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,430
that objects in motion or at rest tend

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,609
to stay in motion or at rest unless

51
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,980
acted upon by an outside force now my

52
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:28,750
hope today is that I can be an outside

53
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,689
force for you all and no i'm not a

54
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,250
recruiter and no i'm not hiring John

55
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:38,590
Turner however is so you can talk with

56
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:40,989
him I say this because it doesn't have

57
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,250
to be that way the future isn't written

58
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:47,769
in stone people it can be bright we can

59
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,159
wear shades we just need to embrace the

60
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,810
way of strategy and we saw she wrote

61
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:54,970
that in order to become the master of

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,060
any one thing you need to become the

63
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:02,709
master of all things and in addition to

64
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:06,159
being a master undefeated swordsman he

65
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,590
was also a sculptor a poet and author a

66
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,530
painter a calligrapher and the list goes

67
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,280
on and on he wasn't a guy that just

68
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,719
talked the talk he also walked the walk

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,510
speaking of which I'd like to introduce

70
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,940
you to Shelley Giesbrecht last year at

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,179
the summit Shelley gave a talk titled 10

72
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,699
ways to rock your sock in it she

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,040
discussed 10 ways or things that she

74
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:33,000
felt he needed to master in order to

75
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,280
improve your security operations and

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,439
that wasn't even her dream job she has

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,599
since leveraged that experience to get a

78
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,668
completely new different job with a

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,379
completely new different company doing

80
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:46,389
completely new and different things that

81
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:52,509
she completely loves and that is

82
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:55,180
completely also so before you get

83
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:57,939
frustrated bent out of shape and quit a

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,310
job company career industry in a huff

85
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:03,578
realized that there's a way that you can

86
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,720
avoid the risk of rut and burnout know

87
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:10,150
the ways of infosec know the ways of all

88
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,978
professions look for things that you can

89
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,750
do where you are right now that you're

90
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:16,000
passionate about that excites you that

91
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,060
interests you and in ways that will

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,440
benefit both you and your employer I got

93
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,389
into digital forensics because I

94
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,639
couldn't stand working in technology any

95
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,070
longer I would say that I was burnt out

96
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,850
but I had a couple of bosses that really

97
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,680
encouraged me to

98
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,960
something in that area that I did enjoy

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,270
and since I wasn't looking for a career

100
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,669
with the hacking team I found digital

101
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:41,500
forensics and I've never looked back I

102
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,170
will also say in all honesty I don't

103
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,870
care that much for infosec it's it's not

104
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,240
that exciting to me it's a job that's

105
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,760
okay though there's benefit in that when

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,770
I moved from consulting into corporate I

107
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,630
saw an opportunity to bring with me the

108
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,700
things that I did enjoy digital

109
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,280
forensics incident response even

110
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,960
e-discovery and in doing so I've been

111
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,090
able to save my company literally

112
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,830
millions of dollars that's good for the

113
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,909
company I've also gotten visibility and

114
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,909
recognition up and down the stack in our

115
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,070
company that's good for me but more

116
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,100
importantly I've had the opportunity to

117
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,070
learn and to grow in new ways that are

118
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,650
completely outside the core competencies

119
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,030
of dfi are and that's been incredible

120
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:32,710
now every job every situation every

121
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:35,380
person is different so I will say and

122
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,690
I'll finish with this quit your job if

123
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,420
you must alyssa is going to talk about

124
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,750
some of that a little bit later but i

125
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,390
would urge you don't quit your job just

126
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,630
to talk about me just to go to the same

127
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,960
job at a different company that doesn't

128
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:56,580
serve a purpose be strategic follow a

129
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,580
new way thank
