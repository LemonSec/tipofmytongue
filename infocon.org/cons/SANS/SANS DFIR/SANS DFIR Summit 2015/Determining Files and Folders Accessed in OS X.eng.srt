1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,500
today I'm going to talk about determine

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,790
a thousand folders to access in OS 10 so

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,679
this is something that people who do

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,299
Windows forensics take for a grant take

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,630
for granted you have the link files in

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,100
Windows you've got shell bags you've got

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,220
recently used entries in the registry

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:26,220
but OS 10 we've haven't had much success

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,630
with having a lot of tracking so what

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm going to go through is I'm gonna run

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:34,649
down how many here use OS 10 okay well

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,180
I'm probably going to run through this a

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,770
little quicker than I normally would I'm

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,390
gonna talk about the graphical user

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,690
interface and some of the terms I'm

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,460
going to use throughout the presentation

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,079
and that's just a setup for how these

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,210
artifacts are created so everyone

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,070
understands what we're talking about I'm

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,020
gonna do quick talk about analysis tools

21
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,480
not too long then we're gonna actually

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,730
talk about this database where it is how

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,379
we identify it we're gonna go through

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,089
the structure a little bit some analysis

25
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,210
I'm gonna show you a couple of my test

26
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,880
cases so I that I use to figure out what

27
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,990
is getting stored in this database and

28
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,670
then I'll talk a little bit about some

29
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,080
of the cases I've used this on so the

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,060
graphical user interface I'm going to

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,310
talk about finder viewing the file

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,590
information what QuickLook is and the

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,450
docs and stacks because these are parts

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,700
of the graphical user interface in OS 10

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,900
that are going to contribute data to

36
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,680
this database or not just gonna let you

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,200
in on a secret

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,970
quick look is up here because the the

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,970
database is called Quick Looks thumbnail

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,009
then when they introduce quick look into

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,630
the operating system they started making

42
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:49,409
this database but it's really just

43
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:51,658
tracking finder activities so this is

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,820
finder if you've used OS 10 when you

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,020
open up a new file or folder this is

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,029
what you're going to see a folder with

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,250
some icons for the files in the folder

48
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,320
it defaults the icon view automatically

49
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,030
you open a new volume it's going to

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,940
default back to icon view that's kind of

51
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,510
how OS 10 works what you see here is

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,920
pictures use pictures for the research I

53
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,829
will tell you that

54
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,329
other file types video media files like

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,490
movies Word documents PDF files they

56
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,490
will put entries in the database

57
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,770
depending on the view so we'll get to

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,310
that a little later but for visual

59
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,320
purposes we have beautiful pictures

60
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,880
this is ListView just another of you for

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,650
finder if you notice down here at the

62
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,720
bottom you still see these little custom

63
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:43,800
icons are created for the files in the

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,870
folder now we have column view what's

65
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,040
interesting about column view is not

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,750
only do you have the little icons

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,359
created for all of the files but you can

68
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,770
actually highlight a file and the

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,870
operating system creates this bigger

70
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,340
picture of the file for you a little

71
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,660
preview over there on the right side

72
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,380
right hand side Cover Flow everyone's

73
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,540
favorite we got this after the iTunes I

74
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,859
think it was one of the updates everyone

75
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,049
needed to see everything in Cover Flow

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,540
um so you can go through your files and

77
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,100
folders and Cover Flow again you have

78
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,840
the icons at the bottoms and then you're

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,739
gonna have a bigger representation of

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,400
the file above so that's your finder

81
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:26,459
view options if you right-click on a

82
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,230
file and find it in well in finder or on

83
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,570
the desktop and you say view file

84
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,429
information it's going to show you the

85
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,540
file information but one thing it does

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,790
when it does that is it creates this

87
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,120
preview of the file so the question in

88
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,920
my research was you know these previews

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,880
are creating entries in a database but

90
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,170
which of these previews is doing it so

91
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,269
here's a preview that the operating

92
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,230
system is created we're gonna find out

93
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,150
if it puts it in the database quick look

94
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,560
push the spacebar when you have

95
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,450
something highlighted and find her and

96
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
it creates this quick look screen if

97
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,780
it's a movie it's actually going to play

98
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,130
the movie for you if it's a picture it

99
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,870
makes it bigger if it's a Word document

100
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,140
you can actually scroll through

101
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,640
PowerPoint presentations PDFs quick look

102
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,518
is just an application so you can

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,750
quickly view quickly look at what's in

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,548
the file your Docs and stacks your Docs

105
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,988
is on the bottom of your screen and over

106
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,120
here on the right hand side is your

107
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,969
stacks that they put in the operating

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,830
system down here well these create

109
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,330
little custom icons when you open them

110
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,710
up and

111
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,050
have a whole bunch of stuff in the

112
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,878
folder this is what it looks like when

113
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,030
you click on your stack it sucks it up

114
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,340
on the desktop so again just another way

115
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:43,318
that the operating system is creating

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:49,138
icons for you so what gets stored in the

117
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:51,780
database so generally speaking if you as

118
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:59,180
a user can see a custom icon for an

119
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:59,179
entry then there's a entry in the

120
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,719
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg just doesn't put

121
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,120
an entry in the database why I don't

122
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:13,860
know it just that's it there's also some

123
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,319
files that it sometimes won't create a

124
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,300
customer icon for not because there's

125
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,069
something wrong with the file you can

126
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,930
open the file it's fine but occasionally

127
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,699
the operating system seems to hiccup in

128
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,860
one of its processes and we don't always

129
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,949
see a custom icon so if it doesn't

130
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,229
create an icon you don't see an entry

131
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:32,610
files on the desktop they're viewed as

132
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,008
icons so they should have entries in

133
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,500
your database files and folders on the

134
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,029
dock will have entries in the database

135
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,940
and whenever a folder is viewed and

136
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:42,990
finder custom thumbnails are created so

137
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,610
you're gonna have an entry in this

138
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,339
database so this is an example of what

139
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,099
I'm talking about I put a CD into my OS

140
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:57,659
10 system I open it up my CDs labeled

141
00:05:53,099 --> 00:06:02,520
shoes because I like shoes nice when you

142
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:04,289
open it up it goes to icon view creates

143
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,080
these little custom icons and when I do

144
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:10,279
that suddenly there are entries for each

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,279
of these files and this

146
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,219
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg nor anyone do an

147
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,889
analysis because what just happened here

148
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:22,229
okay I have a subject that says oh that

149
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,789
cd-rom I never put it in my computer I

150
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:26,190
didn't open look at any of the files on

151
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,360
it that external hard drive I didn't

152
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,580
look at any of those files on my

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,430
computer that's not mine

154
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,020
what what this does is this creates it's

155
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,630
creating a record for us so we can see

156
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,459
what the user was doing in finder what

157
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,509
files they're looking at by putting

158
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,509
these entries in this database

159
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,609
it's actually store tracking user

160
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,260
actions as the users accessing files and

161
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,010
folders entries are being put in this

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,780
database caveat there are some actions

163
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,690
that don't result in an update to the

164
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,638
database and I showed these to you

165
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,960
previously the reason I showed you is to

166
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,060
let you know so when you do the file

167
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,530
previews in column view makes the big

168
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,260
preview on the right side that doesn't

169
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,760
update the database viewing the file

170
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,230
information with the big preview at the

171
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,780
bottom of the file information that's

172
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,520
not going to update the database and

173
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,409
interestingly enough opening a file and

174
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,549
quick look doesn't open doesn't update

175
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,660
the quicklook/thumbnail.jpg so that's

176
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,610
why you don't see quick look in the

177
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,530
title of this presentation okay because

178
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,330
the database has a lot of good

179
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,900
information but it has nothing to do

180
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,000
with okay so let's talk about where we

181
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,450
can find this I can determine the

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,830
account owner for the database and go

183
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:44,130
through some of the information store in

184
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:46,570
the database we'll talk about tools

185
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,250
everyone uses whatever forensic tool

186
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,900
they like this is a database it's a

187
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,789
sequel Lite database whatever sequel

188
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,060
Lite tool you're using is going to see

189
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:57,610
the information little cautionary note

190
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,950
one of the fields is a binary P list if

191
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,260
the tool you're using isn't able to grab

192
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,050
the hex out of that column so that you

193
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,840
can rename it to P list format and open

194
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,190
with some PS viewer or if the tool

195
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,590
you're using doesn't have built-in

196
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,840
capabilities to look at binary P list in

197
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,000
s sequel Lite you're gonna have to do

198
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,219
some more manual processing I'll show

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,479
you what I mean when we get there but

200
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,100
keep that in mind you've got some binary

201
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,139
P list stuff going on so when you're

202
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,130
choosing tools make sure you can see all

203
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:31,500
the information in the database okay so

204
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,500
where is the quicklook/thumbnail.jpg

205
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,950
all this stuff is stored in the darwin

206
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:41,110
user cache which is private VAR folders

207
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:45,160
to random characters followed by 30

208
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:50,170
random characters followed by C and 10.7

209
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:51,790
inure in 10.5 and 10.6 it was in a

210
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,709
different location I put that path up

211
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:58,930
there but it's private VAR folder

212
00:08:53,710 --> 00:09:01,720
random characters random characters and

213
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:06,339
then you'll find a folder called comm

214
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,500
dot apples out quicklook/thumbnail.jpg

215
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,990
and that's that index that's equal light

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,120
is the file we are interested in looking

217
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,230
at what's so great about this location

218
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,680
how many people see the private of our

219
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,650
folder by default yeah I don't either um

220
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,329
a lot of users don't know it's here an

221
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,000
interesting thing about OS 10

222
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,230
it doesn't always delete this location

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,390
for deleted user accounts so talk about

224
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,990
a case later that we'll get back to that

225
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:40,030
okay so this is just going through the

226
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,820
file structure showing you you can see

227
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,530
the two lettered folders followed by

228
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,140
these really long random characters

229
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,520
followed by C and then your combat op

230
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,290
without quick looked up thumbnail cache

231
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,360
and then there's your index that's equal

232
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:57,339
life separate folder for each user on

233
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,710
the system so user activities are

234
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:03,760
tracked per user so it's not oh my

235
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,160
husband must have done that on his

236
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,350
account no every each user profile gets

237
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,360
thrown ok so how do we know which of

238
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:21,660
these folders belongs to which user

239
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:24,010
account we have to associate the user ID

240
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,199
to the folder because private of our

241
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,090
folders is a system area right that

242
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,030
doesn't belong to any one user every

243
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:35,170
user's got a folder in there what's the

244
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,880
problem with using user ID in OS 10 when

245
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,500
the accounts get delete it I have an

246
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,030
account on my system its account 501

247
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,860
later I decide I don't want I'm gonna

248
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,920
give this computer away I delete my

249
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,990
account I make a new user someone comes

250
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,180
along makes another new user later the

251
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,140
point that they can OS time can reuse

252
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:58,569
those user IDs now it's never going to

253
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,990
know it will reuse 5x have seen every

254
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,020
use 501 generally the rule is it takes

255
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,220
the next available number and users

256
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:10,110
so the point is you may have multiple

257
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,750
folders that are associated with the

258
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,000
same user ID if a user has deleted an

259
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,270
account if an accounts been deleted on

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,500
the system this doesn't change things

261
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,480
you should still be able to figure out

262
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,730
kind of what's going on I'll show you

263
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:30,029
how we can do that so how do we know

264
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,300
which folder belongs to whom if you go

265
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:35,100
to the two-letter folder name level

266
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,689
private of our folders two letters you

267
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,580
look at the owner of that folder it's

268
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,410
always going to be the root system down

269
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,510
here at the bottom it says BSD owner ID

270
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,279
zero that's rude that's the system

271
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,870
owning the file you actually have to go

272
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,580
down to the next level with the xxx

273
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,570
random characters and then you'll see

274
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:53,100
the bsd owner ID is 501 now this this is

275
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,170
how my tool is showing me the owner of

276
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,110
the folder different forensic tools will

277
00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:02,069
have a different nomenclature for the

278
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,500
owner of the folder so but however your

279
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,149
tool does it you need to go to the xxx

280
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,529
random character folder to figure out

281
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:12,930
which folder belongs to which user

282
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:16,320
account tools I used I used to backlight

283
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:20,219
if you haven't used it does a nice job

284
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,750
with Mac stuff so my co-workers they

285
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,010
love in case they use encase for

286
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,300
everything so when they go through their

287
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,819
quick looks on me I'll cash database

288
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,410
they use any case in their own whatever

289
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,720
tool you're using it's an a sequel light

290
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,360
database it's got some binary plist data

291
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,100
in there whatever makes you happy I use

292
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,050
Excel an access to go through the data

293
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,459
because I like to have sort capabilities

294
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,930
so what I'm gonna do is look at the

295
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,339
database in the tool that I'm going to

296
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,910
export everything out and be able to

297
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,680
search it sort it etc and access or

298
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,020
Excel or whatever spreadsheet tool makes

299
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,149
you happy

300
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,130
time conversions brings you some time

301
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,620
conversions later epoch converters

302
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,230
version 1.1 does a nice job personally I

303
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,190
just put the conversion formula in Excel

304
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:04,320
because that seems a lot easier but time

305
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,970
convergence or something you need to do

306
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,110
during this process but however you do

307
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:13,110
that is cool okay so now we're getting

308
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,790
to the structure of the database there's

309
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,040
lots of tables in it but we're going to

310
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,110
concentrate on the files table

311
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:24,469
and the thumbnails table because these

312
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,750
are two of the most interesting tables

313
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm look I made them pink so here's all

314
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,040
of the five tables you're gonna see in

315
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,290
the database again we're going to

316
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,430
concentrate on files and thumbnails

317
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,290
because that's where the information of

318
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:43,140
interest is located so your files table

319
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:49,500
has these fields a row ID a folder a

320
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:51,810
file name an FS ID and a version so your

321
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,850
row ID this is an important field in the

322
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,260
files table because this is the field

323
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,390
we're going to use to link the

324
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,390
information in the thumbnails table

325
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:05,370
another thing is it makes consecutive

326
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,079
entries so how is that helpful because

327
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,780
if you're trying to see a pattern of

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,430
user behavior for instance I have a

329
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,030
theory that a user went and downloaded

330
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,319
stuff via Safari and then they once at

331
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,630
their downloads folder and then they

332
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,390
moved those files to an external hard

333
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,010
drive and then they burnt them to a CD

334
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,810
this database is kept in order so I

335
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:26,730
should be able to see the activity in

336
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:28,439
order that had happened right so I'm

337
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,050
gonna see first he's in his download

338
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,790
folder and I'm gonna see next you know

339
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,670
they're placed on this external hard

340
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,900
drive so that actually is helpful when

341
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:41,219
you're trying to figure a pattern of

342
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,230
behavior the folder field gives you the

343
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:47,430
full path of where they're accessing on

344
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,720
the media its OS 10 so whenever you're

345
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,579
dealing with media that's not the

346
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,270
operating system volume it's going to

347
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,550
start with the path volumes one of my

348
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,170
first cases with this the reason I was

349
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,140
using this and relying on this database

350
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:04,110
was we had data on an external hard

351
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:07,460
drive and the subject was cleaning that

352
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:09,480
they didn't know that wasn't their data

353
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,460
they didn't look at those hard drives

354
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,820
anyone could have put the stuff on there

355
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,060
it was in his bag whatever but going to

356
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,490
this database I could clearly see how

357
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,439
the user count on his laptop that's

358
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:25,590
password protected was used to access

359
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,210
these external hard drives and I could

360
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,330
quickly sort stuff by volumes and figure

361
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,460
that out

362
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,350
your bow system ID field is an

363
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,190
interesting one so maybe someone can

364
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,830
help me figure this out someday the

365
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:42,500
first part after file ID equals is a

366
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,470
number right here pointer it's not very

367
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,510
good before the dot there's a number and

368
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,620
that should be a unique identifier for

369
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:53,630
each volume now someone goes how does

370
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:58,820
that unique identifier create it and the

371
00:15:53,630 --> 00:16:01,640
answer is I don't know my inclination my

372
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,740
natural you know gut feeling is it kind

373
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,660
of uses a created date possibly in the

374
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,880
volume header or the header information

375
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,949
of the volume but I haven't figured out

376
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,650
how OS 10 is doing it I just do know

377
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:15,860
that whenever I see one volume and it's

378
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,569
the same volume over and over that

379
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,900
number is the same for all the files on

380
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:24,620
the volume after the dot it's actually

381
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:30,050
more useful after the dot gives you the

382
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,640
seed and number for the file ok now some

383
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,290
people don't like to deal with seen ants

384
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,930
because it makes them uncomfortable and

385
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,400
takes it to a scary place whenever

386
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,579
you're using a people you're doing

387
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,420
analysis on hfs+ or h fsx these seen in

388
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:47,150
numbers are literally a beautiful thing

389
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,880
a couple things generally they're not

390
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,650
reused sometimes if the system's been

391
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,689
used a lot I have had cases volume

392
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:56,660
header puts up a bug and says yeah I'm

393
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,520
reusing seen it but for the most part

394
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,640
they're not reused which means each foul

395
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,250
on the system has a unique catalog note

396
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,000
ID the second thing they're allocated in

397
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,459
order how is that helpful because I can

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,410
do a search sort on my whole volume with

399
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,600
the seen is in order and look at a kind

400
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:19,550
of a timeline of activity famous case

401
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm sure you've heard of it someone was

402
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:26,990
doing a death investigation and you know

403
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,369
someone's dead not alive they look on

404
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,090
the computer and they see all this

405
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:35,030
activity and they see a suicide note

406
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,159
being created and then after the person

407
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,750
dies later

408
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,340
like there's edits to the suicide note

409
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,130
or something anyway the point is that

410
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,600
you see the

411
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,670
were to figure out that someone was

412
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,969
really killed D person and was trying to

413
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:48,660
make the suicide note look real that's

414
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,630
the point

415
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:55,550
so catalog note ID is important um it's

416
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:57,930
helpful here with this database because

417
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,460
when you move a file in OS 10 on the

418
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,150
same volume guess what doesn't get

419
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,400
changed that catalog note ID so while my

420
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,470
folder name may change and even my file

421
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,060
name may change if I'm looking at that

422
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,760
catalogue now and I did and it's on the

423
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,560
same volume I can say hey look that's

424
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,060
the same file because even though the

425
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,679
use of renamed it or even though the

426
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,629
user moved it to know for new folder

427
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,970
this database is showing me that that's

428
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:22,350
the same file that catalog note ID shows

429
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:26,940
the movement of that file through the

430
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,709
system and the last field is this is the

431
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,040
one that's stored in a binary format

432
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,860
binary plist format this is actually

433
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,139
going to give you information about the

434
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,050
file itself that it's recording so it's

435
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:42,690
telling you I'm gonna tell you later

436
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,360
apparently okay let's look at this files

437
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,300
table so this is the sequel I'd database

438
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,750
really pretty isn't it um you have your

439
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:55,820
row ID you have your folder you I've

440
00:18:51,750 --> 00:19:00,900
lost out the user name sorry out there

441
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,700
and you can see all this black stuff can

442
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,110
be helpful and identifying who's quick

443
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
look at cache database this is

444
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,860
especially if it's a deleted account

445
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,750
right let's say there's no accounts on

446
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,240
the system with the number 502 and I'm

447
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,260
this is the 502 database but the

448
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,260
username in there says you know Laurie

449
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,820
well guess what the suspects twice maybe

450
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,710
named Laurie and this could have been

451
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,659
her deleted profile someone has gone in

452
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:29,220
and we did it um so that can sometimes

453
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,840
help you in a case this is the desktop

454
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,790
it's showing you some pictures that were

455
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,679
all in there at the bottom here you see

456
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:41,700
volumes that's an external drive there's

457
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:44,010
no other picture another sample oh wait

458
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,070
one second so you see here in the

459
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,230
version field it says if you plist the

460
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,790
tool I'm using allows me to just click

461
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,890
that button and it's gonna parse the P

462
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,460
list for me a lot of tools don't do that

463
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,780
automatically but that's one of the

464
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,290
they'll use block-like because it does

465
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,240
not automatically but however you want

466
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,270
to get that information out we're gonna

467
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,290
look at it later here's another sample

468
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,790
file see when I put this up here because

469
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,830
anyone who deals with OS 10 you realize

470
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,200
that OS 10 is constantly mounting stuff

471
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:17,520
in that volume point so just because I

472
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,240
showed you a CD previously with shoes

473
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,330
volume shoes this dataset actually has a

474
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,210
couple other things the volumes data

475
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,730
sets folder that was actually a network

476
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,440
connected harddrive so if you're dealing

477
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,880
in an enterprise environment and you

478
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,220
want to know if someone's connecting to

479
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,260
a folder on a share or a server and

480
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,020
getting data off that's going to be

481
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,230
recorded by this and then the volume

482
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:46,600
shared that shared volume was actually a

483
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:50,140
thumb drive that I used so transfer

484
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:52,480
information between my Mac and my PC so

485
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,950
thumb drives get put on here there's a

486
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,030
couple other things that this data set

487
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,890
doesn't show that you're gonna see

488
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:02,560
though when you download stuff

489
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,970
applications like Firefox from the

490
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,940
internet it's gonna come in your nice

491
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:08,920
little dmg but you mount the dmg you're

492
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,810
gonna see volumes you're gonna see that

493
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,730
mounted so anything that's mounted it's

494
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,620
gonna get its own volume mount point and

495
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:18,850
you could see entries for it potentially

496
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:21,550
here in the database okay so here's the

497
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,169
version field when you open it up this

498
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:27,550
is what it looks like it's got a date in

499
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:29,320
there with a number with a date it's got

500
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,240
a generation which is telling you the

501
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,030
version of quick look that generated

502
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,620
this that's not really important that

503
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,810
I've noticed and then it has the size

504
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,479
and that's actually the size of the file

505
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:44,260
of this entry so now I've got a folder

506
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,000
name I've got a file name I've got the

507
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,920
last modified date and time of that file

508
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,570
and I've got a size for that file so

509
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,060
that that's a lot of information about a

510
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,720
file and if that file is no longer there

511
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,179
anymore

512
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,070
most of the seated number so these are

513
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,660
all this simple I've got five data

514
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,879
points for files that may have been

515
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:06,010
deleted and that's a lot to go on

516
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,140
sometimes this is how it relates to the

517
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,470
actual file I kind of did a

518
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,870
a little arrow drawing okay so your date

519
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:18,430
is stored in the number of seconds since

520
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,040
January 1st 2001 once you convert it

521
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,420
you're going to see that that

522
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,010
corresponds that modified date and time

523
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,550
of the file this is just to be showing

524
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,810
the information of that file on the CD

525
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:33,750
and you can see that that size is

526
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:36,280
correlating to the size of the file so

527
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:40,680
that's what this version field is story

528
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:44,110
why does it store it the question ok so

529
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,760
let's say this is what it's a picture if

530
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,649
I open up this picture and I start

531
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,420
editing the picture it's going to update

532
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:52,060
the modified date and time and possibly

533
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,710
the size quick look is using this

534
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,810
information in the version field to

535
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,210
figure out whether it needs to store a

536
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,919
new thumbnail so that's why it's

537
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,160
tracking it it's doing it so it says hey

538
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,720
do I have to do more work but as a

539
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,620
forensic investigator this is helpful

540
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,050
because I can relate this to the actual

541
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,510
file that I'm looking at right I can say

542
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,790
is this entry for the same file well

543
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:22,300
it's got the same size the same date

544
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:24,070
same name etc second table we're going

545
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,810
to look at is the thumbnails table so

546
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,460
the thumbnails table is going to record

547
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:31,840
the size of the thumbnails generated

548
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:36,780
which may indicate which quick which

549
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,780
finder view they were using there's a

550
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,380
file there's a entering this table that

551
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,710
lets us link it to the file ID

552
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,510
information it also has the last hit

553
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,390
date so the last time that the thumbnail

554
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,220
was viewed that could be useful right so

555
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,170
say I didn't look at that I've been open

556
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,860
that folder in 3 years and here's your

557
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:58,420
last hit date of last week total number

558
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,949
of times the thumbnail was shown a hit

559
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:04,810
counts and if there are multiple entries

560
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,080
we can possibly see if multiple find

561
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:10,270
reviews were used we can definitely see

562
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,020
if coverflow is used but we don't know

563
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:17,100
anything about so here are the fields

564
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,060
you have your file ID the size of the

565
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,159
thumbnail

566
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,159
your icon mood field this is going to

567
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,760
show you if it's coverflow it has a

568
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,620
different number in the icon load field

569
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,810
your hit counts the last hit date time

570
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,239
and then it's got a bunch of other field

571
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,040
like width height and it's got a ton of

572
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:44,030
other stuff that's just not useful but

573
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:45,889
maybe someday will be so here's I took

574
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,360
some test data and I said okay so what's

575
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,090
putting stuff in this thumbnail database

576
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,740
and here's kind of the results when

577
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,379
you're in finder if you're find of using

578
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:57,560
icon view you're gonna have one entry

579
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:04,700
and you're some nail size is going

580
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:07,730
between 48 and 64 so I didn't show you a

581
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,740
table yet so when I look at my table if

582
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:12,680
I see an entry and my thumbnail size is

583
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,730
2048 or I can say oh that was an icon

584
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,070
view that's how the user saw it

585
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:22,640
listen column and Cover Flow I'll make

586
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:24,470
the 16 size thumbnail cover flow also

587
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,920
makes a second entry something bigger in

588
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:31,850
this film nails table so here's our

589
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,560
thumbnail table your file ID we got to

590
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,629
use that first column to link it back to

591
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,980
the information in the files table so

592
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,640
that's how I'm going to figure out what

593
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,070
file that three one nine five is - what

594
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,080
does that correlate to right here I see

595
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:47,689
two sizes that are highlighted in blue

596
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,350
one it's 48 and 16 so what does that

597
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:55,160
tell me the user looked at in icon view

598
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:58,459
and some other of you Lister cover

599
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,650
klister column not cover flow this when

600
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,510
I look at that icon mode column it says

601
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,120
one for each of them so cover flow was

602
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,800
not used you see your hit count and for

603
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,560
one of them it's 11 for one of them it's

604
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,409
1 and then it's got that date of when it

605
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,600
lasts hit that date so you can see how

606
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,340
this could possibly be useful the users

607
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,409
continuously going to a folder and

608
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,530
looking at the files in it continuously

609
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,780
accessing that folder especially when

610
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,370
they're denying knowledge of it having a

611
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,389
hit count that's greater than one could

612
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,389
be helpful

613
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:33,240
multiple entries in the thumbnails table

614
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,159
just means different thumbnails word

615
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,279
written generated you're looking at the

616
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,940
folder in different finder views or your

617
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:46,740
icon thumbnail size has changed here's

618
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,179
how you change your icon size just a

619
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,450
side point not really that important

620
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,190
okay so how do we analyze this just

621
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,559
gonna give you my thoughts on this

622
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,360
obviously we all think differently so

623
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,580
when you actually look at this data you

624
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:08,789
may have a different you know path that

625
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:11,939
you run down first thing is your files

626
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:14,460
table can grow excessively large I've

627
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,970
seen one that has over 200 about 200

628
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:22,220
thousand entries in it so it had a lot

629
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:24,929
of data in it about the user activity so

630
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,610
being able to get the data into

631
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:29,610
something that was sorta bull was

632
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:32,490
helpful it's providing a historical look

633
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,428
at things you know the volumes that were

634
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,289
mounted and it will contain information

635
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:42,710
about files that are no longer on the

636
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:44,908
system very helpful the thumbnails table

637
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:47,250
typically I'm gonna say typically does

638
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:51,059
not contain as much data I have seen

639
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,620
instances recently and it's probably

640
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,750
because it's a pretty new computer the

641
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,070
user what account wasn't used a lot but

642
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,360
the thumbnail table had a little bit

643
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,740
more information than the files but

644
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,770
that's because the user was changing the

645
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,510
views but typically the thumbnails table

646
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,908
is not going to store as much

647
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,129
information it gets overwritten quicker

648
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:09,690
it has I've tried to figure out the

649
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,700
exact number of entries that get saved

650
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,149
in it and I've had no such luck with

651
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,529
that yet but you're gonna see stuff in

652
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:18,059
the file table that aren't going to have

653
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:23,970
some entries in the thumbnails table

654
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:25,590
it's just gonna happen okay I talked

655
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,330
about that virgin field and I talked

656
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:31,830
about those seeded numbers in the files

657
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:33,960
table kind of how I approach things is

658
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,639
if I can use that seen it to link an

659
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,110
entry to a file on the system that's

660
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,240
where I'm gonna go first because it's

661
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,580
quick it's easy I can say that's the

662
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,290
file I think it is oh and out here my

663
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,330
that's the file with the same you've

664
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,740
seen it I'm gonna say yep that's an

665
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,060
entry for that file and here's the

666
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,570
information about it when it was looked

667
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:54,570
at the number of times it was hit etc if

668
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,639
cioud is not available why would this

669
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,470
Tina not be available well it's

670
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,030
different if it's different file system

671
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,360
so it has a fat thumb drive or a

672
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:05,250
external hard drive with fat32 I have to

673
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,500
resort to other information to say hey

674
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,880
yes that's that file and then I'm going

675
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,650
to go to the version field and use

676
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,700
things like the file size and the

677
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,710
modified date there's an entry in

678
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,930
thumbnails great that information goes

679
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:23,790
in if not we're going to just rely on

680
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:25,410
the information and files so my first

681
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,970
steps usually is just to export all the

682
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,920
informations out of sequel Lite into

683
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,410
something more manageable for me that's

684
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,150
Excel or access and then I'm gonna use

685
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,220
my sort and search features to look for

686
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,380
information of an interest could be

687
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,510
things like file names it could be stuff

688
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,700
I've already identified paths I've

689
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,410
already identified perhaps you know

690
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,390
you're looking at a fraud case and you

691
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,310
think the person has copied data off the

692
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,990
system then I'm gonna concentrate on

693
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,879
those externally mounted volumes

694
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,000
depending on what you're doing depends

695
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,440
on how you're gonna go through that then

696
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,410
I'm gonna take the thumbnails and I'm

697
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,760
gonna link them together okay just want

698
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,830
to reiterate that that scene it is

699
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,660
really useful is when a user starts

700
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:11,520
moving files around so here was the case

701
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:13,200
I had a user but something in his he was

702
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
downloading stuff from some file sharing

703
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,020
service and then he would copy it to his

704
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,730
external hard drive and then he would

705
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,379
take that file and put it in the recycle

706
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,870
bin and I could look at the information

707
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,060
the fountain in in the files table and I

708
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:28,350
could see that seen it in the folder and

709
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,929
then it got moved to an external drive

710
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,760
so doesn't have the same scene in but

711
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,500
that one with the Cena that I can track

712
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,840
but I haven't any over here for this one

713
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,100
that goes into the recycle into the

714
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,760
trash bin

715
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,620
sorry trash but the nice thing is that

716
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,390
you know using the information that's

717
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,280
seen it and the version field I can say

718
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,810
hey look that's the same file name with

719
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,190
the same version and the same date and

720
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,260
here's how to moving around

721
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,360
and when I tested by to this at a trial

722
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,140
you know that was a very poignant

723
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,760
evidence

724
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,170
the members to consider because the

725
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,480
fouth no longer on the system you know

726
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,070
they he emptied the trash but being able

727
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,580
to say yes that filed that we're looking

728
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,350
at here that is the file that he

729
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,580
downloaded on this state and it was in

730
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,928
this folder and that he moved to the

731
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:16,610
trash and he eventually empty to the

732
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:18,420
trash after he moved to this external ok

733
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:22,320
version field

734
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:24,870
remember binary plist modified date/time

735
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,669
has to be converted you have a tool that

736
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,040
a look at this binary P list that's very

737
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,059
helpful

738
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,620
you're showing you how you could you

739
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,309
click view P list and there's the

740
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,918
information like magic okay here's your

741
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:40,070
date for converting I'm sure you've

742
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,240
converted timestamps before but I

743
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,590
usually put into my presentation cuz

744
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,780
when I gave it to co-workers to always

745
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,459
go hey how do you convert that date in

746
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:51,950
Excel again so I just put it in here so

747
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,169
people just have it simple you know

748
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:58,440
seconds know the time since January 1st

749
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:01,290
2001 and you can even make it a custom

750
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,000
date format in Excel okay this is just

751
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,500
quick showing like if you're using this

752
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,600
clues like eat stop eat pop time

753
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,669
converter does the same sort of thing

754
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,168
decode does the same sort of thing

755
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:18,840
whatever time conversion you want to use

756
00:32:12,169 --> 00:32:22,830
so here is information from files you're

757
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,540
going to notice that always at row ID 1

758
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,399
you're always going to see the same

759
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:28,980
thing okay so this is a new user account

760
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,500
I created on the system and the first

761
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:36,090
entry on every one of these I've ever

762
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:38,160
seen it's always about downloads dot L

763
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,309
PDF and that's because it's on your

764
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:45,330
stack on your doc and so when you log

765
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:49,649
into the system that entry gets me and

766
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:52,020
then after that I put a CD couple CDs in

767
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,360
there and this information was created

768
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,790
you can see that it's two different CDs

769
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,059
because the volume names are different

770
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,730
and because in that file system ID see a

771
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,330
different number before the dot for each

772
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,330
of these files

773
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:16,059
put the date and the last hit date

774
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:17,590
converted birth information then we're

775
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:22,840
going to match the records with file ID

776
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:24,850
and row ID now I'm just gonna walk you

777
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,480
through how I observed and determined

778
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,799
what was reading entries so this is kind

779
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,259
of my test procedure and the reason why

780
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,299
I put this information in it's because I

781
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,639
know I'm telling you how these entries

782
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:38,799
are made but I have believability issues

783
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,149
so oftentimes I don't trust up if

784
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,039
there's no offense or anything but I'm

785
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:44,229
more of a seen as believing type versus

786
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,700
um so I'm gonna tell you what I did

787
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,899
because you may look at that girl well

788
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,940
she's stupid and forgot to do something

789
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:51,008
but I'm just gonna tell you what I did

790
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,419
and how I came to my conclusions and

791
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:54,970
then maybe you can look at it later and

792
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:56,289
say oh I want someone to repeat that to

793
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,789
make sure she's right or you can look at

794
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:59,649
this and say okay I'm gonna trust her

795
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:01,749
whatever you want to do she's gonna tell

796
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:04,449
you what I did I created a new user

797
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:06,369
account I performed actions and as I was

798
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,559
doing it I wrote down on pen and paper I

799
00:34:06,369 --> 00:34:10,480
know crazy what I was doing it when I

800
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,760
was doing it and then I looked at this

801
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,280
index that's equal a database and said

802
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,770
okay that action calls this entry than

803
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,049
we made looking at it in quick look made

804
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:21,399
no observable entry so now I know that

805
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:26,469
quick look has nothing to do with this

806
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:29,138
database I made two CDs see these are

807
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:32,348
just there static meeting us so that's

808
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,790
why I use them one was named shoes

809
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:36,040
woman's name picture and I put some

810
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:39,279
JPEGs on the root of shoes and the

811
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:44,259
pictures I made some folders with JPEGs

812
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:48,369
inside of them okay so this is the

813
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:52,149
resulting information it's hard to see

814
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:58,329
but we'll get through it okay so I put

815
00:34:52,149 --> 00:35:00,578
the CD pictures in change it to ListView

816
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,940
and I open up the photos directory and

817
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:06,760
here I get four entries that's the four

818
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,030
files overs in the folder then I change

819
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:14,140
it to column view and navigate to the

820
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:16,690
Monet folder notice I changed to column

821
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,480
view but we didn't get additional

822
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,160
entries up there for the photos folder

823
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,650
the reason we didn't is because column

824
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:25,149
view and list view use the same size

825
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:29,130
icon so it didn't need to make a new

826
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:31,869
icon so that changed didn't get trapped

827
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:35,950
then the next thing I did was I changed

828
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:37,930
it to I highlighted that one picture in

829
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,419
the column view you know to make the big

830
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,730
one on the side but nothing happens

831
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,859
there's nothing a circle didn't do

832
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:49,839
anything then I changed to Cover Flow

833
00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:53,170
how do I know it's Cover Flow looking at

834
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,910
that icon mode column it says zero so

835
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,050
that means Cover Flow you look at those

836
00:35:54,910 --> 00:36:00,069
widths and Heights they're very

837
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:03,880
different question is how come you don't

838
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,589
see the 16 entries along with these the

839
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,359
reason that you don't is because just

840
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:08,920
above it it was in a different view so

841
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,990
typically with Cover Flow I would expect

842
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,180
to see two entries in a row that's just

843
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:15,609
if I changed to the folder and it's

844
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,629
already in Cover Flow since I was

845
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:19,450
already in the folder and I already

846
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:20,859
created this 16 by 16 icons it didn't

847
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,919
have to do it again so it's just

848
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:28,000
creating the Cover Flow ones down OS x

849
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,390
not doing extra work to see the next

850
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,430
folder I go to you see 0 1 0 1 that's OS

851
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,560
10 when a god first got to the folder it

852
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:37,660
said hey I don't have any of the little

853
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,310
icon so I need to make those for this

854
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,868
folder and I'm gonna make the Cover Flow

855
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:44,980
so I see two entries does that make

856
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:48,550
sense ok just think it through get back

857
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:51,880
to me um the last thing I did was open

858
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,710
the other CD the shoes folder and

859
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,329
defaults the icon view and so those are

860
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:01,270
the entries that you're gonna see there

861
00:36:55,329 --> 00:37:05,619
the icon view 48 by 48 okay these were

862
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,900
the observations I made highlighting

863
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:11,560
that file in the column view to make the

864
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,819
big picture nothing happens you may not

865
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,060
have noticed but when you look at the

866
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:17,619
data closely you will a record was

867
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,960
created for four out of the five files

868
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,690
in the volumes pictures Monet directory

869
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,460
all 5 images were reserved in Cover Flow

870
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,030
but for some reason OS 10 did not make a

871
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,890
picture

872
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,020
do not make us thumbnail did not record

873
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,690
it in the database no I don't know why

874
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,980
it did it I observed this glitch a

875
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:35,080
couple of times not

876
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:40,119
silly with this file but sometimes that

877
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:43,000
happens so it's not always you know 100%

878
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,180
reliable what if there is an entry there

879
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,740
and you know it didn't make us thumbnail

880
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,270
you'll notice there was no entries for

881
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,129
the choose folder which I told you was

882
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:53,440
on that CD but you probably forgot

883
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,660
because of wasn't that important

884
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,760
I didn't navigate to that folder so the

885
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,830
folder was there on the CD the CD didn't

886
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,630
change but I didn't see any entries for

887
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,790
because I didn't open it so OSN didn't

888
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,260
need to make icons so again so OSN it's

889
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,359
not going through making icons for

890
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,560
everything on the volume the user has to

891
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
do something in order to make these

892
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,810
icons that's why I didn't go to that

893
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,640
corner I did some additional testing

894
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:18,759
about this hit count field because you

895
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,379
see the numbers and hit counts they're

896
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,570
all one here but I did some additional

897
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,410
testing once the folders multiple times

898
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:27,790
and it's not always reliable for the

899
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,980
state for the files in the same folder

900
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,270
it would have like eleven for most of

901
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,540
them but a couple of files it would say

902
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:37,600
twelve so the hit count is not like 100%

903
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:40,060
yes the user went there that many times

904
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,900
it could be the user went there at least

905
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:48,580
that many times it's a better statement

906
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:53,440
okay so talked about a couple cases one

907
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:56,319
thing I did want to this is just some

908
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,900
theory stuff obviously I see that you

909
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,960
know intellectual theft this could be

910
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:04,720
useful person connects as a removable

911
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,660
media and they copy files to it that

912
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:12,700
could be important to a company or an

913
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:14,140
organization this is how I've used it

914
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:17,020
files of interest are located in

915
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,730
external media the user account used to

916
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,060
access that external media can be

917
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,820
determined just came back from a case

918
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:26,890
over don't trial the wife had an OS ten

919
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,590
system the husband had a window system

920
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,509
all of the files are found Alyssa these

921
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,869
external hard drives took from the

922
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,070
husband so it comes time the defense

923
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,410
attorney gets up there and they're like

924
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,720
oh did you know his wife liked to watch

925
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:45,940
pornography

926
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,450
okay thanks out well isn't it possible

927
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,040
that

928
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,740
these were her files made on her

929
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,630
computer no because that hard drive that

930
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,560
external hard drive was not connected to

931
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:57,130
her computer oh it's in the

932
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,320
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg connect that

933
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,570
volume to that operating system I would

934
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,820
have seen it and I did not see it she

935
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,200
didn't do it but I did see on his

936
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,200
computer where he connected that drive

937
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,460
to Windows and here are the link so

938
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,460
that's how can be helpful

939
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,839
another case user deleted files and

940
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:21,250
folders so a person in California was

941
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,799
singled out because they were

942
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,820
downloading lots of illicit files I

943
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,680
think they were the number two

944
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,180
downloader in their County so that's

945
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,470
it's a goal

946
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:35,649
not quite number one we get the system

947
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:37,959
no files on it I see some deleted files

948
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,359
that have names that are possibly

949
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,869
suspect so I start looking at his

950
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:45,670
computers there's a laptop he's got the

951
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:46,810
laptop has one user account it has his

952
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,609
sister's name on it

953
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,930
oh he's away at college in California

954
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:53,848
sister lives in the Midwest somewhere

955
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:57,450
was like that is so weird you know weird

956
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:57,450
so go look at the

957
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:06,880
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg

958
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:10,900
and in that database it was a list of

959
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,369
all of these files file names that were

960
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,839
kind of suspect to me because the names

961
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:19,210
had things in it that were probably not

962
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:21,630
very nice so that was very helpful

963
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,680
because he didn't know that this

964
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,849
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg he was tracking

965
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,220
the names of the files he was

966
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:28,480
downloading and all that information was

967
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,790
there for me to read and not only that

968
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,890
but I could you know corroborate what

969
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,509
the investigator said that hey

970
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,690
downloading was happening on these dates

971
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,690
well guess what these entries in this

972
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:42,460
quicklook/thumbnail.jpg jfif ÿû like

973
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,630
it's a hey this is when these files

974
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,010
finished downloading because there's

975
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,640
modify times are when it made it

976
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,640
subsystem

977
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:54,190
if you're talking about shared folders

978
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,660
you can see multiple user accounts you

979
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:59,400
know which user account was doing one

980
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:59,399
these are count specific things

981
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,980
okay I talked about this first case

982
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:07,839
where I looked at the scene in number

983
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,839
and saw the information moving around

984
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,410
I've used the thumbnails table to

985
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,750
confirm that not only did the user

986
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,549
access the folder you know but they saw

987
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,520
there some nail pictures especially and

988
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,140
you know sometimes we have to say not

989
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,579
only does the person have this file but

990
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,170
I know that they've seen it and

991
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:29,210
especially with pictures that's easy

992
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,520
with this because I can say yeah

993
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,890
thumbnail was created this is when they

994
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,810
opened the folder they saw a picture

995
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:38,000
they saw the picture there I can see it

996
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,410
and guess what guess what members of the

997
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,790
jury here's a little screenshot of what

998
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,259
that would look like to the user of this

999
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,300
system because we can all make

1000
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,740
screenshots of what things look like you

1001
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:50,000
know the icon view of a folder that's

1002
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,799
easy to do so that was very helpful the

1003
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,569
other thing to remember five of our

1004
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,490
folders users don't know where this is a

1005
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:57,290
lot of times they don't know that this

1006
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,020
database is tracking what they're doing

1007
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:01,960
and they don't get rid of it so finding

1008
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:05,780
those for the deleted accounts can be

1009
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,790
very illuminating about this information

1010
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,720
that was on the system and the

1011
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:20,319
activities that occurred on the system

1012
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:20,319
okay yeah okay

1013
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:37,560
um I did not measure that no no I know

1014
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,480
it's less than that okay so I had that I

1015
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,790
remember I had this idea about changing

1016
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,540
those I'll show you a picture because

1017
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,540
that's my help

1018
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:52,290
someday I'll get there okay so remember

1019
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:54,420
I was here and I was like hey if you

1020
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,820
change the size of your icons it's gonna

1021
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,350
make more entries so one day I was like

1022
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,870
okay let's see what we can do with that

1023
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:04,860
so I slowly very slowly scroll the crawl

1024
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,720
cannot tell you the number that we've

1025
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,210
made hundreds of entries so it's doing

1026
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,609
it very fast because it's reacting to a

1027
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,140
user and actually for some of them

1028
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,900
because I'm a human I'm not a computer

1029
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,660
I know scary huh but as I was scrolling

1030
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,340
across I must have paused on a number so

1031
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,270
sometimes you would see the hit count go

1032
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,440
up where I didn't scroll evenly um so

1033
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,680
those entries are pre-made pretty

1034
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,680
quickly

1035
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,910
right so I've been doing some side

1036
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,939
research on that and I had a big huge

1037
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,560
spreadsheet of what I see as far as the

1038
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,150
number of entries contained in these

1039
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,099
database and there's no rhyme or reason

1040
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,930
to it like I looked at my math book

1041
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:56,420
which I one of my map books that I've

1042
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:59,440
had since let's seize my girls I've had

1043
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:08,180
it since 2008

1044
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:11,240
and it had it had like 20,000 entries in

1045
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,919
this files table but then I go to

1046
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,259
another case that I'm working on and

1047
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,380
it's not as old as my computer but it

1048
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,910
has 200,000 entries so I don't know what

1049
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,830
the differentiator is or how the

1050
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:27,879
operating I haven't seen any pattern or

1051
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:27,880
been able to determine that yet yeah

1052
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:40,130
oh it does end up in this database yes

1053
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:44,200
it just doesn't you just won't see that

1054
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:49,550
that's Enid number won't mean seen it

1055
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:52,250
it'll mean whatever OS 10 is creating

1056
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:55,190
for it so if you look here that volume

1057
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,830
shared fold in green that's actually a

1058
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,930
fat32 thumb drive but when you get over

1059
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,850
to that file system ID if you look after

1060
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:03,710
the green after the dot it says like 46

1061
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,299
and 47 just that number doesn't

1062
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:08,780
correlate to a scene in there anymore so

1063
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:17,050
I have to use other information so there

1064
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:17,050
that answer yeah yeah

1065
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:24,069
the share that was connected it's called

1066
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:28,960
datasets there but that's the name of

1067
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:30,849
the share that I connected to know as

1068
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,890
far as like the remote servers name it's

1069
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:34,390
just at the mount point so if I said

1070
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,920
mounted this folder it's going to put

1071
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:37,920
the folder name where I mounted it

1072
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:48,069
yes

1073
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:59,360
I have not

1074
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:59,360
I have not so that's a good test

1075
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:12,199
yeah it could be now to throw a bigger

1076
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:13,910
monkey wrench into the equation I was

1077
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:15,019
helping a colleague look at his quickl

1078
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,009
thumbnail cache database because

1079
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:18,258
everybody wants me to look at their

1080
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:22,219
database now very naughty

1081
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:25,329
anyway so I go over and he's got you

1082
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:27,680
know users and then he's got a user name

1083
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:31,430
interesting ly enough at some point in

1084
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:35,180
time that identifier for his OS volume

1085
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:37,038
changed now I don't know what was gone

1086
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,948
what happened on the system whether he

1087
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,680
did some sort of OS pen update any cause

1088
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:44,599
it's changed whether he was repairing a

1089
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,578
file system in a call center I don't

1090
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,689
know what happened my colleagues like I

1091
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,459
thought you said this number is gonna be

1092
00:47:47,689 --> 00:47:51,229
the same for the volume but this is

1093
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:52,430
obviously the same internal volume and

1094
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:54,669
now it's changed now I was like I don't

1095
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,669
know

1096
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,810
so if the entire systems encrypted this

1097
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,980
file would being inside the encrypted so

1098
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,450
you would expect to see to see numbers

1099
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,190
now that is a good theory though because

1100
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,290
he could have at some point encrypted

1101
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:22,660
his user profile was filed ball one and

1102
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:24,700
that could account for the change so I

1103
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,890
don't have a lot of answers I just know

1104
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,470
typically it tends to be the same number

1105
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:33,009
but the CDs it doesn't change within the

1106
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:35,919
file system but within the same computer

1107
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:39,910
and the internal tends to be the same

1108
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,000
number but we did see where he had his

1109
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:45,700
what was it TrueCrypt container was

1110
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:52,110
melted and then had this its own unique

1111
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:52,109
number yeah

1112
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:01,520
so the operating system is very

1113
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:03,830
protective of itself I have been able

1114
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,570
while it's running and live to go in and

1115
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,480
delete this database and then it goes

1116
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:10,670
away like magic it's gone and that

1117
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,500
pretty systems okay with that it will

1118
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:15,980
not let me open it from its current

1119
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,860
location so I can copy it out of private

1120
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,990
of our folders big long path and I can

1121
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,940
copy it to my desktop and open it up and

1122
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:25,339
possibly change it and I have been able

1123
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:28,730
to put it back and it's ok with that so

1124
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:32,710
yes you can but it's not as simple as

1125
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,710
opening making some changes in clothing

1126
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:47,939
yes yes

1127
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,940
yes

1128
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:58,710
and there's somebody and it's still in

1129
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:58,710
the Darwin user cache area same location

1130
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,868
so it should be private bar folders and

1131
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,869
then

1132
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,490
Wow that's easier

1133
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:42,269
any other questions
