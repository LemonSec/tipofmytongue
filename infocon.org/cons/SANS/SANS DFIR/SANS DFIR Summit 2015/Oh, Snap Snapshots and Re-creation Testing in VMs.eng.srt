1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,610
best-font I possibly could to sugarcoat

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,809
it the title is oh snap why because you

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,559
think you're doing something really

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,410
smart you think I'm going to actually

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,020
test things I'm gonna be the smart

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,359
person who doesn't screw up and when

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,880
maybe my analysis goes over to someone

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,710
else maybe me I'm not going to be the

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,810
guy who's wrong or the gal who's wrong

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,789
and so you create a virtual machine and

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,229
you create a snapshot and then you make

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,969
another snapshot and you make another

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,430
snapshot and you testing you test new

14
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,079
testing you revert you're like haha it's

15
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:42,649
not there but guess what you're wrong

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:48,510
why because the virtual machine is

17
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:50,610
ruining you with snapshots because

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,039
what's really happening is that your

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,710
virtual machine is buffering all those

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,230
changes and it hates to commit them

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,750
hates hates hates to convince them I'm

22
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,120
not joking about how many times I try to

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,489
force it to commit them because I wanted

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,380
to be a smart person and use snapshots

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,479
so I could row back and retest and

26
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,420
retest and retest and instead it

27
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,950
punished me over and over and over and I

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,689
tried this with virtualbox and I try

29
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,610
this with VMware and I tried this with

30
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,189
parallels and I tried this with hyper-v

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,900
and everything else I could and all the

32
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,169
developers have the same idea which is

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,299
screw you Dave you can't get the data

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,520
you want because you made a snapshot so

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,640
forever on i am going to maintain this

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,100
image in a way that you not want it why

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,170
because snapshots contain the data you

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,179
save but the second you enable it it

39
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,579
starts to buffer those changes and it

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,890
doesn't let it commits to the image so

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,000
what happens is is you make a change I

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,009
know this because it's happened to me

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,470
about two years ago and I said I've made

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,049
my change i'm testing shell bags I'm

45
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,640
pausing my VM I'm going to go look into

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,780
the image because I'm so smart and I'm

47
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,920
gonna pull out the registry and

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,829
nothing's there and I'm like I can lie

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,969
to all this testing damn boyega dawn is

50
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,408


51
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:08,060
well no it turns out that when I

52
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,459
actually went into the image and i

53
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,390
extracted the live hive all the data was

54
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:16,340
there and I was like okay obviously I'm

55
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,470
just doing this wrong clearly I should

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,230
just read the documentation and force

57
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,750
this so that I went in and I forced it

58
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,420
my said push in that commit make another

59
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,370
change consolidate the snapshots and I

60
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,548
looked again and it still wasn't there

61
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,129
and I said well screw virtualbox i'll do

62
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:37,220
it in vmware clearly Oracle is wrong and

63
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:41,480
the vmware is that no you still can't

64
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:44,690
have it and ice it damn it what can I

65
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,578
possibly do so I said well is it just

66
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,560
VMware images in general is it just

67
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,569
virtual disks and I said well I'm gonna

68
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,329
do what I shouldn't do I'm just not

69
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:56,780
gonna enable snapshots and that it was

70
00:02:53,329 --> 00:03:00,049
there suddenly the damn data showed up I

71
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,170
was looking for this stupid key for

72
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,640
weeks might and the funny part was I

73
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,720
just assumed everyone else already

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,920
figured this out so I didn't say

75
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,440
anything about it for a long time and

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,238
that a couple months ago I'm working

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,799
with one of my guys and we're going

78
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:15,889
through and we're testing some stuff and

79
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,560
he says Dave nothing's there I said

80
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,389
really nothing's there he said yeah I

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,780
said using a p.m. right he says yeah

82
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:27,230
said you make snapshots of course I said

83
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,359
gratulations you're wrong so he went

84
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,750
here anitha live image pulled out the

85
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,670
data I was right I don't always have to

86
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,230
say that but there's times specifically

87
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,268
when certain people try to say things

88
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,638
like no no you're wrong Dave today

89
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:43,069
you're wrong good and pure that's how it

90
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,030
is and I say no I'm sorry in this case I

91
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,319
actually asked you to test at this

92
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,260
because I already knew this but I need

93
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:52,130
you to validate this please try again

94
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,160
and so what you'll find if you're trying

95
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:58,060
to be smart like we were is that you're

96
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,790
going to have a stale virtual image

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:04,970
every time and I haven't found a easy

98
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:08,060
way yet to fix it the only way I found

99
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,160
is not to ever enable snapshots or just

100
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,409
really use a real machine use your own

101
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,819
machine and put on an agent or run

102
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,530
inside the virtual machine with an agent

103
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:17,659
pull out the day to live but otherwise

104
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,269
when you go against those flat

105
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,430
IM decays vhd SVD eyes whatever it is

106
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,000
and you try to pull data out of that

107
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,160
image you're just gonna be sad and wrong

108
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,990
now it gets even worse I know you're

109
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,680
saying Dave how could it get worse oh it

110
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,170
does because I get a lot of opposing

111
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,760
expert reports I do a lot of work and

112
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,770
I'm not going to tell you about this

113
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,930
case what I'm gonna tell you is that

114
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,450
they made a conclusion about shim cash

115
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,090
and they said certain executables don't

116
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,670
show up in shim cash we know we tested

117
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:55,489
this and I said that's utter crap I've

118
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:57,020
read everything I possibly can about Jim

119
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,120
cash I've read the Microsoft documents

120
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,240
I've bought people drinks about it I've

121
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,100
done everything I possibly can I've sent

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,630
all sorts of interesting things would do

123
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,190
everything I can possibly can to make

124
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,040
sure that I am right before I write

125
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,360
something down and then I locked it the

126
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,800
report and I said that's really weird

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,900
because we both have the same virtual

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,190
image and so we rebooted the image

129
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,840
rebooted the image after running this

130
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,910
program and it still didn't show up on

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,340
the shim cash until we shut it down and

132
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:28,040
suddenly a program that had been run

133
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:31,280
five reboots ago showed up it's dumb I

134
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,950
don't like it I don't want it and I want

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,590
to make sure that you know never ever

136
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,930
trust a snapshot you may revert to it

137
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,760
use it in live analysis but if you're

138
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,230
ever planning to look at that disk your

139
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,760
ever plan to extract from that image

140
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:49,490
never ever trust a snapshot don't turn

141
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,090
them on don't use them don't like them

142
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:56,290
don't adopt them just leave them alone

143
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,289
thank you very much
