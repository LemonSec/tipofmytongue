1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,000
everybody thanks a lot for tuning in

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,040
um today we're going to talk about this

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,679
uh The New Normal in cyber security

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,719
which I think pretty much everyone is

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,539
aware of a quick introduction my name is

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,300
Michelle takur you can leave the tea out

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,359
it's uh my last name sounds much better

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,580
without that

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,519
um and I am the senior director for dfir

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,000
at Ankara and we are in Australian

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
practice and my core speaker for today

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
is John Lopez he's also a senior

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,879
director of the fir and at Encore as

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,399
well we're both based out of Sydney but

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,040
today I am coming to you from Hawaii uh

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,680
John is in Sydney so we hope everything

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,980
works out pretty pretty good

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,620
a quick look at the agenda guys um we'll

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,620
have a quick look at um the current

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,300
transcape um basically our friends away

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,860
oh how how's it going and what's

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,220
happening out there we'll look at uh the

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,740
major ransomware groups uh producters

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,299
behind them and uh what's their

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,979
motivation and operation how do they

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,080
actually operate what do we see in the

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,460
real world

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,260
um we'll quickly talk about

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,960
um managing ransomware attacks based on

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,020
our experience in the in the industry um

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,420
working with the clients who've been hit

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,400
by ransomware attacks and what we have

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,640
learned um to be really good in managing

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,100
these these kind of attacks uh we'll

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,080
quickly share a couple of uh interesting

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,759
real world cases

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,520
um to give you an idea of the kind of

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,020
incidence we see in the ransomware field

40
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,479
and some interesting uh things about

41
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,400
them that we've seen

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,100
um we'll talk about detection a little

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,799
bit uh which is um I think very

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,979
important uh to focus on to prevent or

45
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,439
actually you know at least contain these

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,020
attacks when they happen and how to wipe

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,700
those detections and use them in your

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,960
environment

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,420
we will also look at some of the

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,580
forensics best practices again based on

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,760
what we've seen while dealing with these

52
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,819
incidents in in real world and what we

53
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,940
think are really important practices

54
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,239
that that help responders like us to to

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,280
do a good job basically at the end of

56
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,599
the day

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,660
um cyber insurance policies uh I'd say

58
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,700
definitely one of the most important

59
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,379
aspect of um

60
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,420
dealing with ransomware or dealing with

61
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,780
cyber incidents as a whole we will uh

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,060
talk about that we will talk about what

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,280
you should look out for based on our

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,860
experience going in helping people after

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,260
the incidents have occurred

66
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,900
um some gotchas uh you should you should

67
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,940
be aware of and some other ways of

68
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,459
making sure the policies you are looking

69
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,000
at really give you enough bang for your

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,319
buck

71
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,739
um and the most important slide of this

72
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,739
presentation according to me and John as

73
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,080
well will be talking about communication

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,720
strategies um we really do believe

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,760
that's one of the most important aspect

76
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,220
of managing ransomware incidents

77
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,440
we will finish off with some further

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
resources

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,260
um and some further reading for you guys

80
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,120
to have a look at in your own time after

81
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,260
the um

82
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,260
presentation and um we will take

83
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,239
questions and answers and try to give

84
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,340
answers after that uh just a couple of

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,159
quick points um this is only a 30-minute

86
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,200
uh 30 minutes

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,260
for the entire presentation which is uh

88
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,599
not enough to talk about ransomware we

89
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,420
could literally go for hours so we will

90
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,599
cover as much as we can but please

91
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,940
remember we will be around after the

92
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,920
talk to to answer your questions and

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,700
even after this Summit we we will share

94
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,599
um

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,700
information with you to get in touch

96
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,019
with us and you know we can keep the

97
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,780
conversation going so please do not

98
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,640
hesitate to ask questions

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,739
um another important point I should make

100
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,439
quickly is this is mostly around how to

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,980
manage incidents uh how you can you know

102
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,079
get prepared for these incidents when

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,100
they happen

104
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,279
um and also we will share some some you

105
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,660
know Real World experience that we've

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,840
had this is not a technical uh hardcore

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,660
technical presentation but if you do

108
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,580
have any technical questions again do

109
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,419
not hesitate to reach out on slack or

110
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,400
even after like I said we'll share

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,139
LinkedIn details emails and all that

112
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:38,699
stuff

113
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,520
so with that we'll get started for this

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,020
current slide I will hand over to John

115
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,900
hi folks um as as Michelle uh introduced

116
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,520
my name is John Lopez and I work

117
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
alongside Vishal as a senior director at

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,840
and career Consulting in the Australian

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,540
dfir practice and it's a pleasure to be

120
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,699
part of the deeper Summit today and

121
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,500
share some of our experiences and

122
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,380
insights about ransomware with you it's

123
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,060
quite early in the morning in Australia

124
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,300
news so so hopefully I am quite coherent

125
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,120
and as you can tell there's a bit of a

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,860
noise coming from the outside where the

127
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,259
birds have decided to go crazy apologies

128
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,120
about that and hopefully you can hear me

129
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,860
okay

130
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,680
uh as the title of our talk suggests

131
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,780
ransomware is now a staple of the threat

132
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,580
landscape and it's a bit like covert

133
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,259
that it's just part of life now that we

134
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,419
have to manage cyber criminals are

135
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,720
exploiting systems or more usually

136
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
purchasing access to compromised systems

137
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,039
via an access broker in order to conduct

138
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,440
their ransomware attacks and the attack

139
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,600
itself is usually quite simple and

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,520
involves preventing a victim from

141
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,199
accessing their critical business data

142
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,600
and then demanding a ransom payment to

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,759
release the access

144
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,680
and the effectiveness of these attacks

145
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,479
are alarming with attackers able to

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,000
identify the data take steps to ensure

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,979
access by destroying the backup data

148
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:01,199
where possible and then post the demand

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,180
in a matter of hours or days

150
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,160
and you'll see in some of our examples

151
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,800
some examples of that later in the talk

152
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,840
and then realizing that they could

153
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,699
return increase their return on

154
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,919
investment this is a simple attack model

155
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,800
basically trended to a dual attack of

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,560
data theft with the attackers demanding

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,780
a further Ransom payment in order to

158
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,000
prevent the threat of the data being

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,039
released publicly whether or not they

160
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,560
followed through with that threat is is

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,759
hit and miss

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,800
in a lot of cases

163
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,259
and all all business types unfortunately

164
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,419
are potential targets but according to

165
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,180
many industry reports the most impacted

166
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,000
sectors appear to be Health Care

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,400
education research and government and

168
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,380
despite some disruption activity by the

169
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,880
government and law enforcement on key

170
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,979
operators the problem is still not going

171
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,539
away

172
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,120
crowdstrike's 2022 Global threat report

173
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,180
attributed at 82 increase in ransomware

174
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,880
incidents in 2021 from the previous year

175
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,740
and to give you some scale of the

176
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,960
problem in that same year the U.S

177
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
treasury is reported to have tracked up

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,280
to 5 billion US dollars in transactions

179
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,259
linked to ransomware payments from

180
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,080
players such as Regal Alpha quantity and

181
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,699
Phobos

182
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,840
back over TV show

183
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,639
thanks Sean um so quickly looking at

184
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
what motivates these guys I mean money

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,099
obviously is the main motivation uh for

186
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,259
for all these attacks um

187
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,680
we see pretty much you know most of

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,660
these cases end up in here give us money

189
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,660
or else you know we'll destroy your data

190
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,599
um we have over the last few years seen

191
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,780
disruption being a motivation as well

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,180
where basically this just won't bring um

193
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,819
you know companies down or research

194
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,680
facilities down and basically you know

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,020
there's um that's that's the that's the

196
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,539
actual goal of the attack

197
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,120
and uh

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,599
at some point we've also seen um maybe

199
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,819
not reported that much but we've

200
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,440
definitely seen um testing or

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
experimentation basically someone's

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,340
writing new ransomware code and they

203
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,380
just want to test it and see how it goes

204
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,060
and you know if they've got a pipeline

205
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,240
of people who can distribute it and test

206
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,419
it we've definitely seen that as well

207
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,300
operation is uh

208
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,180
um as most of you would be aware mostly

209
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,620
it's just ransomware as a service

210
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,080
nowadays it used to be different but we

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,539
we have seen a trend of people moving

212
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,919
towards that because it's much easier

213
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,958
anyone can literally just hire this

214
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,659
service and just run it run a campaign

215
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,520
or you know distribute it in whatever

216
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,260
way they feel like or whatever they can

217
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,260
and go from there

218
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,600
um there is in-house development as well

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,940
some traductor groups are using their

220
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,399
own code they're you know well basically

221
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,440
using the code that's already out there

222
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,540
and then uh modifying it a little bit

223
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,080
adding more features to it and then um

224
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,100
Distributing it and you know trying to

225
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,220
make money out of that or disrupt

226
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,680
um and we still see

227
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,320
um if you if you go on looking for it

228
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
you can still buy finished products and

229
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,740
then you know use your other channels to

230
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,360
distribute it

231
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,899
um so that's just a quick look at what's

232
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,180
the motivation behind these attacks um

233
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,019
pretty obvious really and uh some of the

234
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,420
operation modules that these guys are

235
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,040
using to to

236
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,800
um cause disruption in the you know

237
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,660
basically just bring companies down

238
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,100
whenever they can

239
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,180
forward to you John

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,279
thanks fish okay let's take a look at

241
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,080
some of the things that we've seen that

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
uh make a real impact when it comes to

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,580
managing ransomware attacks and it'll

244
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,320
probably come as no surprise but those

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,300
organizations that have given some

246
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,459
consideration to the attack before they

247
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,680
actually occur often very reasonably

248
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,519
well

249
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,040
uh yes it does not always prevent the

250
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,959
incident from happening but it means

251
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,360
that the during stage is less dire less

252
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,700
stressful and far more considered and

253
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,519
controlled the clear standout is

254
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,080
ensuring that a well-designed backup

255
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,540
system is in place and most importantly

256
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,680
tested

257
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,800
we've had cases in Korea where the IT

258
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,380
team thought that the off-site data

259
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,240
backups were in place and then only to

260
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
realize that the backup job had been

261
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,440
failing for the last 12 months during

262
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
the incident and that's not really a

263
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,580
good look for them and it's a real game

264
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,560
changer as far as the incident recovery

265
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,000
goes

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
more mature organization more more

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,440
mature organizations might have a

268
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,600
documented incident response plan or a

269
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,000
documented Disaster Recovery plan which

270
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,339
they can consult but it's important even

271
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,080
if that's in place to ensure that these

272
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,839
are up to date and of course a regular

273
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,820
rehearsal of the plan usually from the

274
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,459
form of a staged or a tabletop style

275
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,680
incident means that senior business

276
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,320
stakeholders incident responders and the

277
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,360
IT team can prepare themselves for this

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,700
type of questions that they need to ask

279
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,860
and the decisions that they may need to

280
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,620
take during an incident during the

281
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,720
incident and the ransomware through the

282
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,920
scenario

283
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
there's just so many good tabletop in a

284
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
box type resources available and we'll

285
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
link a couple at the end in the in the

286
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,380
slides and many of them are free and

287
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,260
they help guide this type of scenario

288
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,940
discussion

289
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,459
and the preparedness will really greatly

290
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,500
assist with Key activities required

291
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,079
during the incident

292
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,700
activities like coordinating with the

293
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,560
multiple stakeholders including the IT

294
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,540
team the legal team the business

295
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,300
operation teams

296
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,920
and the third parties like the insurance

297
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,500
providers and outside legal council and

298
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,720
other regulatory bodies and even the

299
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,459
need to formulate Communications to

300
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,740
those bodies and decide when to send the

301
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,959
communications and and if to send the

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,000
communications

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,220
from a dfir perspective the number one

304
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,500
issue we see is the Lost opportunity to

305
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,360
capture forensic evidence

306
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
while the focus of the business is

307
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,980
typically on the business continuity the

308
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,200
systems are being rebuilt VMS get

309
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,899
deleted or log data gets aged out and

310
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,420
deleted all of which could be could have

311
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,519
provided valuable insight to resolve the

312
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,620
incident faster and answer key questions

313
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,019
about the threat actor activity in the

314
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,820
environment and they could all be

315
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,440
avoided with some proper planning and

316
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,060
preparation

317
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,920
once the incident is completed it's

318
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,660
important to consolidate the learnings

319
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,880
from the experience and feed that back

320
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,220
into the prepared stage so that next

321
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,800
time things go much smoother or they

322
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
don't go at all and they get prevented

323
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,700
the attack gets prevented

324
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,959
back over tvish

325
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,640
thanks Sean um

326
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,760
like we said at the earlier slides we'll

327
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,639
discuss a couple of interesting cases we

328
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,079
John and I deal with a lot of ransomware

329
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,000
incidents in our team is um always

330
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,160
involved in um you know helping people

331
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,500
out once they've they've been attacked

332
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,180
and compromised

333
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,639
um but we thought we'll share a couple

334
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
of real world cases that we've actually

335
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,079
seen and worked on um to to give you a

336
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,940
bit of an example of what we see in the

337
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,760
industry today so one of the cases we

338
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
helped out a fry company and

339
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,680
it was a pretty deep-fried company and

340
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,579
um

341
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,500
an interesting thing we found was when

342
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,440
we started uh investigating um the the

343
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,560
organization and their infrastructure

344
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,779
um the actual exploitation that we found

345
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,779
uh had occurred way back in 2020

346
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,600
um the threat actors had got them in by

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,240
using an exposed RDP

348
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,000
vulnerability and uh basically they've

349
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,160
been coming in and out pretty much

350
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,680
unchecked which is

351
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,839
um sounds pretty unusual but

352
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,240
unfortunately we do see that every now

353
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,399
and then

354
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,600
so this was really interesting to see

355
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,940
that they've been coming in and out as

356
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,860
as

357
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,959
they wanted for

358
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,060
um more than a year by the time we got

359
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,500
involved

360
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,660
um obviously the network was left

361
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,180
exposed for a long time they were like I

362
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,959
said coming in and out as they wanted

363
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,420
another interesting thing we saw and

364
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,980
this is probably something we don't see

365
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,519
that much they were using the pretty

366
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,200
well-known application called megasync

367
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,019
which is usually

368
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,019
um designed to basically back up your

369
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,639
data or you know have you have your data

370
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,279
transfer over to a different location

371
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,120
um

372
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,700
and it's really efficient in doing that

373
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
it's it's been designed and developed to

374
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,380
to do that particular

375
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,160
um that particular purpose and they had

376
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,980
gotten in they installed it on the on

377
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,779
the organization's Network and uh

378
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,820
basically just exfiltrated data using

379
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,500
Mega sync

380
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,899
um and that went on for for quite a bit

381
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,920
as well

382
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,639
um

383
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,420
and um

384
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,279
once all of that had been done in the

385
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,860
end around maybe a year and a half after

386
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,199
initial access they use ransomware to

387
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,360
basically just encrypt all the citizen

388
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,420
ask for money in this case

389
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,480
um we are not sure and um

390
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,180
it's pretty hard to really really um a

391
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,160
certain for sure that it was the same

392
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,519
threat actors that that encrypted the

393
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,260
servers in the end or did they just sell

394
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,300
the access to some other group or you

395
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,800
know share information with each other

396
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,420
or whatever

397
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,940
um but that's um how it all ended in the

398
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,699
end um and uh it was um it was an

399
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,459
interesting case and uh the report was

400
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,139
pretty big as you can imagine

401
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,959
uh I'll hand over to John for the next

402
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,959
example

403
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,959
ah thanks fish uh in this next case the

404
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,120
incurred dfir team responded to a

405
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,579
ransomware incident about uh last year

406
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:52,620
which impacted an australia-based

407
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,199
national law firm uh with several

408
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,660
officers in the country

409
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,339
um

410
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:00,600
the time frame from the initial

411
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,180
compromise to the ransomware actually

412
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,920
encrypting the files was approximately

413
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,380
four hours so it's a very quick

414
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,680
turnarate turnaround from the operator

415
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,600
um to to actually kick off the The

416
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,100
Ransom

417
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,720
um the the initial access to the

418
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
environment environment was obtained via

419
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,579
exploitation of the exchange proxy logon

420
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,660
vulnerability

421
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,240
uh and this was reasonably soon after

422
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,579
the Patch was released and unfortunately

423
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,160
for the client the IT team thought that

424
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,300
that patch had actually been

425
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,940
successfully applied and we actually saw

426
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
this with with multiple clients in that

427
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,560
instance where where they they failed to

428
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,899
properly verify that the patch had been

429
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,220
applied and they thought that they were

430
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,199
protected

431
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
um once inside the environment the

432
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,160
threat actor leveraged some tools such

433
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,800
as process hacker to bypass AV and

434
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,839
advanced Port scanner to to do internal

435
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,240
Recon on the environment and then access

436
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,279
to network shares and internal remote

437
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,620
desktop Prof

438
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,440
protocol to to move laterally amongst

439
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
the systems

440
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,699
and the ransomware in this case uh

441
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,619
actually deleted volume Shadow copies

442
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,079
and system report restore points and

443
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,020
security event logs in order to really

444
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,939
make that recovery process far more

445
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,980
difficult and less feasible for the

446
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,679
client and we also saw that they use

447
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,900
scheduled tasks to trigger the execution

448
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,319
of the ransomware across the environment

449
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,299
from a forensics perspective the key

450
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,340
thing that facilitated the investigation

451
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,280
was that luckily the IT team detected

452
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,140
the incident quite early on in that four

453
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,080
hour window as they were in the process

454
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,820
of investigating a failure with the

455
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,760
backup system at the time and um and

456
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,620
they and they managed to take some

457
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,080
snapshots of the virtual servers prior

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,020
to the systems being encrypted and that

459
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,600
allowed us um some evidence to to do

460
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
some analysis and and actually find out

461
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,080
a lot about what happened uh in that in

462
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,580
that incident

463
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,380
since there was some concern around the

464
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,720
backup system Integrity

465
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
um the client engaged in negotiations

466
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,240
team with the threat actor who during

467
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
the process actually lowered the payment

468
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,740
demand multiple times and significantly

469
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,440
uh during the incident as if they were

470
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,059
losing confidence that the victim was

471
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,880
actually planning to make the payment

472
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,320
um so that was quite an interesting

473
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,720
anecdote on that one

474
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm back over to you Vish

475
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,919
thanks John and just quickly on this

476
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,840
slide um that the reason we're sharing

477
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,240
these real world examples um just a

478
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,500
couple in this case because we don't

479
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,539
have a lot of time but he's uh just to

480
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:34,799
give you an idea of what actually

481
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
happens because a lot of people

482
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,700
um have obviously everyone's heard about

483
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,980
ransomware but uh

484
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,780
um unfortunately there's not a not

485
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,160
everyone has to go through the entire

486
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
process right and not everyone has to go

487
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,240
through these uh interesting scenarios

488
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,500
where you know

489
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,419
there's negotiations happening with the

490
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,640
threat actors and Ransom demands have

491
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,620
been changed and you know stuff like

492
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,140
Mega sync being used for Expo training

493
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,120
data the takeaway from this all really

494
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,580
is to tie it back to that the title of

495
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,780
the talk which is you know living with

496
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,840
rats or and just to get some

497
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,760
beautiful Lessons Learned sort of a

498
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,620
thing where you know you can see all of

499
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,799
these things for example uh is checking

500
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,020
regularly when you're applying

501
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,600
um patches and you know new violent will

502
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,340
these come out and you you know think

503
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,860
you fixed it but if you

504
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,780
fail to check

505
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,880
um or double check on that it might

506
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,679
still be a problem so these are sort of

507
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,340
lessons learned that you know um we

508
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,200
haven't really had to do much in the

509
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,539
past but now with the whole ransomware

510
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,400
game exploring

511
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,919
um to to new heights now it's become a

512
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,660
bit of a bit of a necessity to keep

513
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,940
checking uh what's happening there for

514
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,580
example you know new tools being

515
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,200
introduced into environment there has to

516
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,580
be some sort of detection

517
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,520
um for all these things just so that we

518
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,220
we can make sure that we're covering all

519
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,640
all angles um so that's sort of a bit

520
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,260
more context why we're sharing all these

521
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,440
things

522
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,419
um

523
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,100
detections are probably one of the most

524
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,720
important things if you want to prevent

525
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,380
or at least contain

526
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,640
ransomware attacks or any attacks really

527
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,340
even for that matter as soon as possible

528
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,020
um I'll quickly go into how you can you

529
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,320
can write detections or get detections

530
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,080
in your environment some bigger

531
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,940
organizations can have their in-house

532
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,700
detection teams which we do understand

533
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,720
is not not for everyone but if if you

534
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,340
can't afford to have a team in doing

535
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,940
that that would help a lot um for others

536
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,280
you can subscribe to treading tailfeeds

537
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,660
which release new detections

538
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,980
fairly regularly

539
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,700
um

540
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,720
and um another way of doing this is also

541
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,940
just uh keeping it look look out for you

542
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,799
know research Publications and um

543
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,980
there's a lot of analysts who who are

544
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,360
analyzing these things and then

545
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,080
publishing papers on that you can grab

546
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,580
um stuff like you know the commands

547
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,559
being run for example you know base

548
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,500
detections on that and if you have some

549
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,600
sort of a capability some sort of you

550
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,419
know in-house ADR system or even uh you

551
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,059
know commercial ones you can manually

552
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,980
put these detections in as soon as you

553
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,160
you get them and basically the moment

554
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,520
these detections are fired triggers

555
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,059
basically you can go in and take steps

556
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,760
you can you know kill these processes or

557
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,640
take these machines offline so that they

558
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,320
don't keep spreading through you

559
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,840
throughout your organization uh or

560
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,820
basically the moment you've detected it

561
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,500
um it's it's anyone's game at that point

562
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,080
it can do a lot as far as containment

563
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,059
goes

564
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,360
and I know this is a bit of a

565
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,299
technical type of a slide and if you

566
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,820
have any questions about it

567
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,100
um please let me know I'll just uh slack

568
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,860
me about it um now the the screenshots

569
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,120
you're looking at

570
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,720
um are mixed up of Windows and Linux uh

571
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,840
ransomware variants as you can see the

572
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,260
bottom most is one of the

573
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,919
Linux based uh ransomware we've seen in

574
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
the past six months or so

575
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,860
um they are they basically are going

576
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,400
after uh VMware ESX servers you know

577
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,799
running a lot of commands trying to kill

578
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,039
the um VMS running on those CSX servers

579
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,140
before they encrypt um

580
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,480
stuff like that uh it's pretty pretty

581
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,700
easy to base detections on these things

582
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,720
once you've got this information

583
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,559
over to you John

584
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,640
we've touched on a couple of these

585
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,200
already but from a forensics best

586
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,820
practice perspective when it comes to

587
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,559
ransomware incidents there's a couple of

588
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,480
common ones that regularly stand out on

589
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,640
the cases that we've been involved in

590
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,679
pretty much all of these are themed

591
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,059
around the timely capture and

592
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:04,799
preservation of digital evidence and

593
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,659
Telemetry and there's nothing more

594
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,280
challenging than working on a case where

595
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,440
little or no usable evidence exists

596
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,539
because the client I.T has deleted the

597
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,640
impacted systems or logs of late have

598
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,820
aged out because they weren't copied

599
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,559
many systems run as virtual machines and

600
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,059
it's quick and effective to take a

601
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,520
system snapshot either during or prior

602
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,039
to the ransomware being executed where

603
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,960
snapshots are not possible take some

604
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,000
system images or memory captures of a

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,580
sample of the impacted systems

606
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,100
and additionally export and collect the

607
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,080
system log data such as antivirus

608
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,120
endpoint detection and response systems

609
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,659
IDs IPS and firewall logs especially

610
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,400
where these are not already securely

611
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,280
stored centrally and possibly the key to

612
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,080
enabling these if you don't already have

613
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
an established process or Playbook is to

614
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,760
engage a digital forensic specialist as

615
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,740
early as possible and even if you don't

616
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,840
end up taking their services you

617
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,880
probably will but that but they can

618
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,620
provide some initial guidance on what

619
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,659
evidence would be the most valuable for

620
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,820
your particular environment for forensic

621
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,200
analysis

622
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,000
one of the main hurdles we see to

623
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,919
achieving some of these is when the

624
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,720
affected organization uses an I.T

625
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,480
service provider provider and in these

626
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,460
cases it's off it can often take many

627
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,620
days or even weeks to obtain the data

628
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,900
and the key obstacle seems to be the

629
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,520
ambiguity and the contractual

630
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,039
requirements for the IT service provider

631
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,220
to conduct the activities or otherwise

632
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,380
some reluctance to do so and get

633
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,539
involved it's important to have the

634
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,100
discussion of head of time ahead of time

635
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,140
with the IT service provider about their

636
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,059
capability to support the evidence

637
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,159
acquisition and any of the other

638
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,600
incident response activities

639
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,480
okay moving on to uh cyber insurance

640
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,059
policies nowadays cyber insurance

641
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,100
policies is an important almost

642
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,720
essential part of managing the

643
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,020
ransomware risk and for victims that

644
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,240
have a cyber insurance policy the

645
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,740
insurance provider or the insurance

646
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,380
broker is often the first Port of Call

647
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,539
for assistance when they experience an

648
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:11,880
incident in Australia in the last few

649
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,799
years we've really seen this as a growth

650
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,140
industry as the insurance industry

651
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,120
itself has adapted to the growing demand

652
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,580
for services and it's common now that

653
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,260
they provide a central point to the

654
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,000
client for the facilitation of the

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,220
incident response management engaging

656
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,080
specialist services such as legal

657
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
counsel digital forensic experts

658
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,580
ransomware negotiators and of course

659
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,620
advice on the claims management process

660
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,539
itself

661
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,820
possibly the most important gotcha when

662
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,740
it comes to cyber insurance is the

663
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,900
coverage not just in terms of the

664
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,940
business disruption value or the excess

665
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,460
amount to make the claim but the

666
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,080
specific items that are being covered

667
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,960
for example many policies do not provide

668
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,000
courage for temporary or replacement

669
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,120
hardware and any security uplift outside

670
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,580
directly managing the threat actor as

671
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,500
part of the incident and this can be a

672
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,779
bit of a gray area there's a TV

673
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,220
advertisement in Australia where a

674
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,200
caboodle runs around the house holding a

675
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,360
lightsaber basically destroying the

676
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,700
place and at the end the owner asks are

677
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,080
we covered for that

678
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,840
cyber insurances can be a bit like that

679
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,659
in terms of digital forensics this is

680
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,460
often a critical component of the claims

681
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,039
process in order to provide validation

682
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,480
of the incident type and answer

683
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,039
questions like

684
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,840
what what was the initial compromise

685
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
Vector has it been fixed

686
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
what was the scope of the compromise and

687
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
did the threat actor access or

688
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,600
exfiltrate any data of regulatory

689
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,940
significance

690
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,799
the rising cost of cyber Insurance

691
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,140
presents A new challenge as the number

692
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,480
of and size of the ransomware claims has

693
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,820
grown insurers have responded by passing

694
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,320
on the cost in the form of increased

695
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,080
premiums it's not necessarily the case

696
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,000
now that organizations can afford to

697
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,100
mitigate the ransomware risk primarily

698
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,679
with cyber insurance and it needs to be

699
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,960
complemented with the investment in

700
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,640
increasing the security posture of their

701
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,200
I.T systems

702
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,840
another challenge is for organizations

703
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,460
that are required to provide certain

704
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,679
coverage levels due to their contractual

705
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,659
requirements with their clients

706
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,600
especially government contractors these

707
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,820
organizations may now need multiple

708
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,059
policies to meet those require required

709
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:22,980
coverage levels for example in Australia

710
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,779
sometimes you need insurance coverage of

711
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,640
up to 20 million dollars and that can be

712
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
hard to cover with a single policy

713
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,900
on a positive note some insurance

714
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
providers are now pushing proactive

715
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,919
measures asking more questions about the

716
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,260
existence of Baseline controls such as

717
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,720
multi-factor authentication data backup

718
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,640
regimes and even security awareness

719
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,799
programs

720
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,020
back to your Vish

721
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,840
thanks Sean um yeah this is one of the

722
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,140
most important aspects of managing these

723
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,179
incidents to make sure you've got the

724
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,980
right insurance policies in place and

725
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,580
their coverage is you know just a white

726
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,919
type of coverage for your organization

727
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,039
it's very important and again feel free

728
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
to Ping us if you brought some specific

729
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,500
questions so we can try to help you the

730
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
experience we've got in working in the

731
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,659
industry and with clients and you know

732
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,760
taken from there

733
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,520
um communication strategies um so having

734
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,980
worked in um really really big

735
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,860
organizations and you know financial

736
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,100
sector and software and all that and

737
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,440
also um having experience working with

738
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,900
clients this is probably I would say one

739
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,940
of the most important aspects of

740
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,559
managing um

741
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,260
any any incident really but more so they

742
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,000
ransomware

743
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,400
um uh incidents because obviously we

744
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,140
know with ransomware there's a certain

745
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,779
level of

746
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:50,820
drama involved so it's really really

747
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,340
important it's uh managed in the right

748
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,360
way

749
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,820
um

750
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,320
obviously with any incident not just

751
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,179
ransomware but definitely with one so

752
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,080
where there's many different

753
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,360
stakeholders involved um there's you

754
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,400
know regulatory notifications and

755
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,200
inquiries that we need to take care of

756
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,320
on media is a really really big part of

757
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
it and customers obviously the most

758
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,700
important part of it uh and then

759
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,340
internal staff as well more so from you

760
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,220
know managing who is communicating and

761
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,100
how and having policies in place

762
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
um based completely on the way to

763
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,179
communicate with with all of these

764
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:28,860
stakeholders when the incident actually

765
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,600
does occur

766
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,580
um it's really important we do have a

767
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,200
single point of contact for bigger

768
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,179
organization that could be an entire

769
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,700
team for smaller could be just one

770
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,520
single person it's very important

771
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,340
because we need to make sure the

772
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,940
information that's going out is

773
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:50,100
consistent with the communication

774
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,840
strategy we've already built and the

775
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,940
policies we've brought internally

776
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,299
worked on and ready to go we do not want

777
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,919
people to

778
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,720
specifically people who should not be

779
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,659
talking to um uh outside parties uh

780
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,760
communicating at all

781
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,460
um again really important that the

782
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,440
information that is being released

783
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,720
regarding the ransomware attack is

784
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,700
consistent it's very timely and uh

785
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,580
we want to make sure that there's no one

786
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,679
asking questions that are pretty basic

787
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:23,940
like what's happening with my data

788
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,860
what's happening with uh you know the

789
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,960
backups and where is my basically

790
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,720
where's my data uh stuff like that and

791
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,580
also really really important one of the

792
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,299
last ones I think on this slide is

793
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,640
uh need to know bases really I mean when

794
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,440
you are under attack

795
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,640
um you need to really quickly uh analyze

796
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
the situation and come up with a

797
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,720
strategy that allows you to pass on

798
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,480
information uh to people who need to

799
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,980
know about it basically not everyone

800
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,840
should know about everything that's

801
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,880
going on in the background as well it

802
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,980
just creates more confusion um and

803
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,080
uncertainty than than you require and

804
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,340
you require while you're running an

805
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,779
incident

806
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,279
um so yeah definitely communication is

807
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,559
one of the most important aspects of it

808
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,659
and again and reach out to us I think

809
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,240
we're we're almost at time uh reach out

810
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,500
to us if you have any specific questions

811
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,200
about it but this is definitely one of

812
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,580
the most important things that we've

813
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,080
seen while running these incidents

814
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,960
with that we are at the end of this

815
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,460
presentation

816
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,620
um we have some resources and further

817
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,080
reading there you can quickly check them

818
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,940
out they will help you for different

819
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,799
things

820
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,020
and uh we're open to q a
