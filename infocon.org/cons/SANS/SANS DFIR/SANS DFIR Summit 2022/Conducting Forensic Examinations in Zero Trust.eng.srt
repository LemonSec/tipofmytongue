1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,900
so I'm Justin Tolman I'm with us tarot

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,000
and if you've never heard of extero

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,559
maybe you've heard of Access Data they

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,900
bought access data about

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,880
almost two years ago and I came over

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
with that

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,400
um

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,640
with that acquisition so my background

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,859
is in forensics specifically law

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,720
enforcement-based forensics

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,599
um and then I jump to access data and

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,820
taught forensics there for a couple

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,700
years and now

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,480
um I got into creating content and kind

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,219
of coming to these things because it was

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,440
it was a lot of fun and so now I

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,820
technically work in the marketing

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,040
department but I know nothing about

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,260
marketing I'm the technical guy that

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
they keep in marketing so that I can

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,520
translate content between uh

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
you and them so we're going to do an

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,940
overview of zero trust kind of what it

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,379
is

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,059
um we've had a couple mandates come out

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,459
recently uh we'll talk about remote

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,020
forensic collection and forensic review

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,400
and how they play into zero trust so

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,479
let's get into it it's kind of a

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,280
blessing and a curse

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,560
being right before lunch

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,600
because you're like let's just get

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,640
through it uh

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
okay so first off

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,920
um zero trust is not really A New

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,860
Concept uh

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,720
it's kind of become a buzzword in the

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,759
last few years I'm sure many of your

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,560
organizations have started talking about

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,200
it uh and implementing various things

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,939
around it but uh the mentality of zero

43
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,020
trust has been around for a while

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,360
originally kind of started out as a name

45
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,479
called Black core and apparently that

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,159
was a bit too hardcore for mainstream uh

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,560
so they changed it to zero trust and the

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,020
basic tenet of zero trust is as the name

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,780
suggests you don't trust anything or

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,640
anyone this includes services and people

51
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,979
so we're going to talk about that

52
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,619
and how it impacts forensics

53
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,360
um and one thing to keep in mind is zero

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,180
trust does not necessarily

55
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,340
um a product now there are companies

56
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,080
that sell a lot of helpful things and a

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
lot of Solutions in this space but zero

58
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,420
trust is not just software okay so it's

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,879
a way of approaching your network it's a

60
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,340
paradigm it's a it's an architecture

61
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,760
okay that combines both software and

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,319
hardware and all that sort of stuff but

63
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,379
also policy and a mentality within your

64
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,739
organization of protecting that which

65
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,780
matters most to your organization which

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,980
is the data

67
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,519
okay and what that data is totally

68
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,360
depends on your company's mission

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,060
and when I say your company's Mission if

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,220
you're say a federal civilian executive

71
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,560
branch that may be you know things

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
related to National Security and maybe

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,220
government information if you're a

74
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,019
private company it may be user data it

75
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,300
may be company data IP whatever the case

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,920
may be the point is to protect that data

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,840
not say

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,879
um some perimeter defense or something

79
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,580
we'll talk about that in a second so the

80
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,620
key thing is zero trust is not a single

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,840
solution

82
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,840
um but a workflow or a set of principles

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,060
that you're going to go by within your

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,019
network

85
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,720
and this can cause conflict

86
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,819
um between forensic examination teams

87
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,640
forensic teams uh post breach teams even

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,459
and I.T teams if they're not

89
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,220
um communicating very well and so as we

90
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,959
go through this we're going to talk very

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,720
much about how communication is the key

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,799
to getting forensics working fluidly

93
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,220
within companies or agencies that are

94
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,379
implementing zero trust

95
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,360
okay

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,959
so just a bit small history

97
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,060
and this is again like I said this has

98
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,640
been degrading this has been kind of

99
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,420
changing for years but the old style and

100
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,040
a lot of companies unfortunately still

101
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,799
behave this way a little bit is that

102
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
we're going to protect at the border at

103
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
the perimeter right we're not going to

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,738
let anything in but once you're in hey

105
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,660
it's all good

106
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,339
um

107
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:22,680
were were just going to protect at the

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,900
edge obviously this is

109
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,940
um not cool

110
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,320
uh for multiple reasons first off uh

111
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,000
the work from home culture we'll talk

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,419
about that later uh but our companies as

113
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,040
well have become more remote just in

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
your resources I mean is there a company

115
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,600
or an agency here that uses no cloud

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,000
based

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,340
anything

118
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,259
yeah I mean it's just that it's not a

119
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,080
thing like there's some aspect of your

120
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,620
agency of your company that has

121
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,960
endpoints resources servers something in

122
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,560
the cloud that's not going to be on-prem

123
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,479
um you're going to have workers you guys

124
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,180
are here you may or may not be connected

125
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,360
to the VPN through your laptops uh but

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,180
you still may have company resources on

127
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,360
your machine that sort of thing so what

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,479
we've done is we've de-parameterized and

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,220
uh I'm not sure if Microsoft Office

130
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,199
actually has that in its dictionary so

131
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,680
it may uh flag but nist calls it de

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,020
perimeterized so we're gonna make it a

133
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,639
word whether it is or not

134
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,220
we've de perimeterized our Focus

135
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,580
and focusing in on the data and that's

136
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,500
what zero trust is all about we don't

137
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,020
trust anything that accesses the data

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,580
that's what we're going to protect so

139
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,259
anything that is going to access the

140
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,000
data we're going to go through a set of

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,300
security and a set of authorization and

142
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,820
what do you do as forensic examiners

143
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,460
well you're after data

144
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,660
and so this can create a little bit of

145
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,960
conflict between you and an IT team who

146
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,020
is trying to lock everything down and if

147
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,060
you're part of the IT team realize that

148
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,979
the forensic people need to get access

149
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:11,639
to that data to do their job so

150
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,139
in in this uh becomes a conflict so uh

151
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,240
the I.T people aren't just setting up

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,860
all these rules so they can exact

153
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,360
control over your lives I mean that's

154
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,180
part of it because they're in I.T but

155
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,120
it's really because

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,539
um these zero trust High trust uh lack

157
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,720
of trust policies are all about uh

158
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,880
protecting that data

159
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,740
Okay so

160
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,380
what is the goal of zero trust again

161
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,660
prevent access to data what are we doing

162
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,639
we're going to authenticate authorize

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,600
and validate every bit of access and use

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
of our data within the network from

165
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,259
anything and that includes both the

166
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,560
users as well as resources

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,680
now if you're say a simple example would

168
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,479
be if you have

169
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
um no external point of sale system then

170
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
you probably don't need your website

171
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,759
accessing your financial stuff okay very

172
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,580
segmented networks that sort of thing if

173
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,259
anything does have access to something

174
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,080
we're evaluating all the time whether it

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,560
needs to maintain that access okay

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,099
so always checking into that

177
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,919
so recently and especially if you work

178
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,419
for

179
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,000
um a government agency fcev a federal

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,759
civilian executive branch agency

181
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,680
um and then some of this actually

182
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,300
extends to some of the third party

183
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,620
contractors that are also working with

184
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,280
those fceed agencies okay

185
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,139
the president of the United States

186
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,319
President Biden put out the executive

187
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,599
order on improving the nation's cyber

188
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,620
security

189
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,500
and they set a pretty ambitious deadline

190
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,479
um you can see a quote up there straight

191
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,180
out of the

192
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,319
um

193
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,319
the document and

194
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,479
what they talk about is that and this is

195
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,860
how business kind of goes right we do

196
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,479
incremental steps we'll get there when

197
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,680
we get there

198
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,680
we're going to fix what needs to be

199
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,560
fixed as we encounter that problem

200
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,599
and so in this mandate they say nope

201
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,280
that's not good enough

202
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,560
we need to set a firm deadline in all

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,020
these agencies anything within basically

204
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,900
the executive Branch's control needs to

205
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,800
implement uh zero trust policies by

206
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,719
September 2024.

207
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,700
and

208
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,380
for those of you who have implemented

209
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,440
new departments new policies new I.T uh

210
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,059
things you know that that's pretty

211
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,339
ambitious and especially with something

212
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,480
as widespread as zero trust so what are

213
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,740
the security goals of zero trust that

214
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,720
laid out in this

215
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,060
um moving to single user identities

216
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,959
single sign-on that sort of thing

217
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,100
multi-factor authentication avoiding

218
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,720
things like text messages and easy

219
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,459
phishing stuff okay so fixing all that

220
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,320
um applications now this is going to

221
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,140
impact you directly as

222
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,860
um

223
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,100
uh forensic analysts sometimes is

224
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,720
there's various aspects of your

225
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,279
applications your forensic or

226
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,820
post-breach incident response tools that

227
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,100
um exceed what it typically wants to

228
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,899
give you as far as permissions I know

229
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,100
when

230
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,120
xtero

231
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
required access data we did this big

232
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,220
presentation a bunch of the access data

233
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,399
people showing them ftk right ftk imager

234
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,399
in fact and a bunch of the people from

235
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,980
the exterior side wanted to install and

236
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,200
play with ftk imager so we're like yep

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,700
here's the download it's free on the

238
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,380
website just go pull it down you can

239
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,839
play with it all you want so there was a

240
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,220
bunch of them that did that and then

241
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,779
they couldn't even install it on their

242
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,540
laptops due to it policy

243
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,760
um because ftk integer requires admin

244
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,339
access and so that was kind of the first

245
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,080
kind of

246
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,040
um

247
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,380
slap in the face there as we kind of

248
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,140
integrated and the kind of conflicts

249
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,899
continued not not conflicts but like how

250
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,279
do we solve this problem and we'll go

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,140
through those but something simple like

252
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,980
that

253
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,680
I need to run imager or I need this

254
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,300
person to be able to do that you can't

255
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,160
you're going to treat these applications

256
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,140
as hostile pretty much all the time

257
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,140
constantly checking for vulnerabilities

258
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,880
um and going through it one of the key

259
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
basic like if you wanted to sum up zero

260
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,300
trust

261
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,540
is give the least amount of access

262
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,820
necessary to do the job

263
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,399
okay and that goes for both services and

264
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,600
people and we're going to wrap back

265
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,240
around to that and how you can

266
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,760
facilitate communication with I.T

267
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,160
departments and find that middle ground

268
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,980
and able to do your job effectively

269
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,620
while stilling while still allowing it

270
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,899
to do this of course because that's

271
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:00,060
that's the game uh is proper

272
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,140
communication

273
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,360
uh we heard this morning from I think

274
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,740
Rob right be kind right so if you uh you

275
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,019
want to approach this uh with open

276
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,880
dialogue so data this is the primary

277
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,500
objective of course

278
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,360
um in enough in zero trust is what we're

279
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,519
protecting in in forensics you're

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,320
protecting that as well typically you

281
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,100
need high level access to it and so

282
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,839
again that creates an issue we'll talk

283
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,240
about in a second

284
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,680
devices

285
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,740
So within zero trust you have to be able

286
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,380
to monitor or be aware of audits okay

287
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,540
inventory every single asset within your

288
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,240
network that is a stipulation of zero

289
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,660
trust okay so every device now the

290
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,279
interesting thing it's not interesting

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,640
but it's interesting is that there is no

292
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,220
concession given for whether that device

293
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,100
is sitting in an office sitting at a

294
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,860
home at Starbucks or at a Sans Summit

295
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,640
okay you have to be able to react to

296
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,300
that device in the event of a breach

297
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,220
well how do we do that

298
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,200
and all these different types of

299
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,480
scenarios you need to have tools and

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,300
policies and procedures that allow you

301
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,680
to

302
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,760
um react to that we're going to talk

303
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
about that as well in a second

304
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,459
okay so forensics this is what we deal

305
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,740
with right devices

306
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,959
so our Network again

307
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,800
um focused on protecting the network and

308
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,420
tighten up your network so these are the

309
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,640
five basic over line over group what

310
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,339
anyway words uh of what the zero trust

311
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,820
mandate focused on and they go in depth

312
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,959
there

313
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,019
on each one and we'll talk about here

314
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,399
shortly

315
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,839
um the cyber security incident and

316
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,440
Security Agency uh sisa released A

317
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,620
playbook in November for uh the

318
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,420
playbooks for incident response and

319
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,279
vulnerability

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,579
um and so you should check those out if

321
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,480
you deal in first off if you're an fceed

322
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,760
agency hopefully you are already aware

323
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,459
of it but it actually lays out a lot of

324
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,899
good information

325
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,139
for implementing zero trust post-breach

326
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,660
response to your infrastructure that's

327
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,700
published by sisa and it was published

328
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,680
just in November of 2021 so it's

329
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,899
relatively new

330
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:33,180
um and CIS is kind of a relatively new

331
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,060
organization as well so we'll look at

332
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,279
their playbook here in a minute

333
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,980
so one of the key things of xero trust

334
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
is that you need to have visibility into

335
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,700
every aspect of your business that deals

336
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,680
with data okay and that's just what

337
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,300
we've been talking about and that's

338
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,440
really what zero trust architecture is

339
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,019
um is the ability to see what's

340
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,040
happening

341
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
and to react to that

342
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,740
uh securely and to mitigate the risks

343
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,200
associated with any breaches or forensic

344
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,540
investigations

345
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,180
okay so this is the cisa incident

346
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,120
response Playbook again this is on their

347
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
website you can download it of course

348
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,139
there's a lot of documentation actually

349
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,220
did

350
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,320
um an eight-part YouTube video series

351
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,079
Breaking it down as well

352
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:25,800
um

353
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,120
but

354
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,899
this can be super helpful for you guys

355
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:34,320
uh in how to implement forensics

356
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,139
post-reach response and data protection

357
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:41,699
into your network even if you are not an

358
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,440
FCB agency or something like that it's

359
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
written for them there'll be certain

360
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,699
aspects of it that don't apply to you

361
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,100
like and if you're not an fcev agency

362
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,880
for example an fcev agency has

363
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,760
um 48 hours to report any breach to sisa

364
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,160
well if you're not an fcev agency you

365
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,720
don't necessarily have to abide by that

366
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,000
uh rule but it's a lot of good

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
information a lot of good workflows

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,339
um in that Playbook and here's kind of a

369
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,440
the outline this is just the incident

370
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
response one I don't have the

371
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,800
vulnerability one but it's in the same

372
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,019
document and check it out really good

373
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,019
work they pull from two different nist

374
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,240
documents their own research and a

375
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,620
couple other things to build this up

376
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,040
so

377
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,860
let's get into the actual forensics of

378
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,180
it

379
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,260
um

380
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,139
most of you probably are in distributed

381
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,880
environments whether that's in a single

382
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,160
building work from home multiple

383
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
building satellite offices those types

384
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
of things

385
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,380
so we need to be able per zero trust to

386
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,019
see all those devices and react to them

387
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,480
in the event of a breach or a forensic

388
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,920
investigation

389
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,639
so you need a tool that can see over the

390
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,139
network

391
00:15:58,139 --> 00:15:59,399
um

392
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,839
there's a bunch of tools out there

393
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,720
obviously I work for Xterra but your

394
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,320
tool needs to be able to reach out

395
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,339
and access that box

396
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,620
poll images remediate we'll talk about

397
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,260
remediation here in a second so how do

398
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,940
we do this though in a zero trust

399
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,120
environment where that La that

400
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,100
endpoint's probably not going to accept

401
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,540
any you know signals from outbound or in

402
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,339
inbound signals

403
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,779
well what you want to do is have

404
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,519
something that you can work with I.T

405
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,120
again and install an agent so again just

406
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,980
with the example of ftk Enterprise again

407
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,899
there's whatever tool you use you want

408
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,500
to pre-install your agent work with your

409
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,540
it teams to get your agent in the gold

410
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,779
image okay the agent is the same so they

411
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,940
can validate it and then just roll it

412
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,519
out with each one and you can set up

413
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,740
your connections after the fact and this

414
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,160
will make it happy because you've worked

415
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,680
with them okay and this makes you

416
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,720
effective because now you can connect

417
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,299
through that they've whitelisted your

418
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,699
traffic and you can now communicate with

419
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,540
that

420
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,699
your agent's communication is encrypted

421
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:15,059
which also satisfies the network

422
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,099
requirement to keep all data secured

423
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,740
across the wire and the cool thing about

424
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,079
this is you don't have to go anywhere

425
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,199
you can do the forensics from your desk

426
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,480
and reach out through the network

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,540
it's important to be able to react in

428
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,100
these situations so what is it that your

429
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,559
forensic investigation wants to do first

430
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,240
off these agents are installed typically

431
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,120
as admin access which has a dual effect

432
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,280
of one giving you all the keys to their

433
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
laptop again you're going to have to

434
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,640
communicate with your it Department if

435
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,860
you have a segregated kind of I.T

436
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,960
forensics setup

437
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
and then the other thing that's cool

438
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,900
about that is in a zero trust

439
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,760
environment nobody has admin access

440
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,340
typically on their box which

441
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,100
is a hassle for forensics as well

442
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,400
um but they can't mess with your agent I

443
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,080
can't even delete shortcuts off my

444
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,720
desktop on my company laptop which for

445
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,000
me I keep a very sterile desktop on my

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,440
personal stuff

447
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,539
and so it drives me nuts I filed a

448
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,860
ticket with it to have them delete it

449
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,600
they said no and super sad uh so I made

450
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,860
them as small as they would go but

451
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,160
anyway that's that's my personal battle

452
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,020
right now

453
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,980
um so we need to be able to uh access

454
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,260
that image or access that computer to be

455
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,820
able to maybe image it we're probably

456
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,039
not going to do that in a breach

457
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,860
response speed is speed is key we need

458
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,720
to react we need to determine what's

459
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,160
going on

460
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,200
um so maybe we need to pull memory we

461
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,440
need to uh pull files whatever the case

462
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,419
may be maybe we want to remediate we

463
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,100
want to shut down the computer we want

464
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,780
to delete some files kill some Services

465
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,120
whatever the case may be

466
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,400
we don't have to worry about going out

467
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
to that box we can increase our speed

468
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
securely through zero trust because

469
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,340
we've worked with RIT we have encrypted

470
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,760
traffic and our agent was pre-installed

471
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,100
uh within the gold image or it could be

472
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,380
deployed if um if that's what you work

473
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,059
out with it

474
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:16,200
uh to the box and we can react the way

475
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
that we need to to prevent the spread of

476
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
the breach through our Network or to

477
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,919
just pull files and do our forensic

478
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,320
examination if that's what we are doing

479
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,480
as well

480
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,960
so very important there and again we

481
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,820
need to

482
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
um be able to handle our Cloud

483
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,799
repositories as well so your forensic

484
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,240
solution will need to be able to pull

485
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
from your various SAS connectors SAS

486
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,620
sources I'm sure many of you use uh

487
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,220
Google drive or box or uh office or

488
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,660
whatever the case may be there's many

489
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,160
out there

490
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,799
remember that zero trust says you need

491
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,200
to have access to all your data

492
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,640
all the time

493
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,059
so make sure you're getting that as well

494
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,940
now covet kind of

495
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,039
um accelerated this but the work from

496
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,799
home and and travel concept definitely

497
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,799
was around for a long time before that

498
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,419
joined access data back in

499
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:17,760
2015 or something and they were a work

500
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,340
from home culture back then

501
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,400
uh so when covet hit I mean a lot of

502
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,660
things changed of course but as far as

503
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,100
my work schedule

504
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,100
my commute was the same uh

505
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,840
every now and then my daughter's a

506
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,480
little like crowd the stairwell and I am

507
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,480
delayed five seconds but you know

508
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,160
traffic jams but zero trust

509
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,559
um and covid kind of accelerated this

510
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:45,360
whole thing of pay everybody's kind of

511
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
going home but you still need to be able

512
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,380
to manage that

513
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,080
so you need a solution

514
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,140
um that can reach out and still read

515
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,200
these things uh remote whether they're

516
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,660
on or off the network okay and when I

517
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,039
say off the network I don't mean not

518
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,260
connected to the internet

519
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,220
um

520
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,840
if they're not connected to the internet

521
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,299
you can't communicate but what I mean is

522
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,280
they're not connected to like the VPN or

523
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,980
something like that okay you want an

524
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,960
agent that can communicate back but wait

525
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,600
a minute here we have another

526
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,140
inbound communication and zero trust is

527
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,140
very much not about inbound

528
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,700
communication from outside of your

529
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,919
network there's various Solutions out

530
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,440
there that can help you I'm just going

531
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,059
to name one but it's because it's the

532
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,500
only one I know right off the top of my

533
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,620
head but like Z scalar is a company that

534
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,500
facilitates these type of zero trust

535
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,799
back communication they help tunnel and

536
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,780
secure those Communications to make it

537
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,419
so that you are still in compliance

538
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:49,380
um

539
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,200
as you do these things but remember this

540
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,900
is important because zero trust makes no

541
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,840
concession for where your resources are

542
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,600
okay you can't say well there was a

543
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,419
breach and all of our stuff was stolen

544
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,500
or damaged or lost or whatever but you

545
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,600
know they were at Starbucks and that's

546
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
why we didn't do anything nope you still

547
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,280
have to be able to

548
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,340
uh react to those situations you still

549
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,919
need to be able to reach out across to

550
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,799
anything and this can of course create a

551
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,419
hassle for forensics

552
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,059
uh for instance professionals if your

553
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,980
agency your company your department

554
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,799
doesn't have that ability to reach out

555
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,679
across the network and mitigate those

556
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,020
risks on remote

557
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,000
um devices

558
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,440
and of course when they're not connected

559
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,000
to the VPN how are you going to address

560
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,280
that as well

561
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,919
so one thing I want to talk about there

562
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,840
was a there's actually two articles I

563
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,139
think

564
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,659
I reference one

565
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,799
um but it's actually been updated so uh

566
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,820
this this says 600 000 short if cyber

567
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,320
Security Professionals many of you

568
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
probably feel this as you may have

569
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,100
openings or you may feel overworked or

570
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,240
something

571
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,640
um and that in this article said it's

572
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,140
only going to grow there's already been

573
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,500
another article so that was March uh

574
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,080
2020 uh two there's already been another

575
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,640
article that has upgraded this another

576
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,360
150 000 short in the cyber security

577
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,039
space

578
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,960
and which I would include forensics in

579
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,980
that

580
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,720
um we're always looking for

581
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,720
new people and I don't think we can hire

582
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,419
our way into compliance I don't think we

583
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,480
can hire our way into

584
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,419
um effective uh

585
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,520
you know coverage that's not to say

586
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,400
we're not going to hire we're all still

587
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,179
necessary the thing is here we're short

588
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,299
how do we how do we bridge that Gap well

589
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,740
within your environment

590
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,320
automation plays big into filling this

591
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
Gap and also allowing you to configure

592
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,120
forensics and post-reach response in a

593
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,400
way that is compliant with zero trust

594
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,380
because you can literally program it to

595
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,419
do certain things at certain times and

596
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,919
you can change that

597
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,280
and so uh you know

598
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,080
maintaining the right amount of access

599
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,559
necessary to do the job so the cool

600
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,940
thing about automation is you can

601
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,159
integrate your forensics with your sore

602
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,159
and scene perimeter uh

603
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,960
Solutions whatever those may be through

604
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,200
apis or whatever okay so that you're not

605
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,419
losing valuable time if you get a call

606
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,220
at two in the morning how long does it

607
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,600
take you to get to work well your

608
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
automation can actually be working

609
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,460
already to collect remediate

610
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,679
um image whatever the case may be so

611
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,900
that when you arrive at the office

612
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,240
you're ready to do what humans do and

613
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,000
that's analyze draw conclusions create

614
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,200
next steps that sort of thing okay

615
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,940
now

616
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,500
um

617
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,539
the trick here like I said is

618
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,700
communication with your I.T departments

619
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,780
and so the minimum amount of access

620
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,120
necessary to do the job and this is

621
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,659
where when I talk to people at various

622
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,039
conferences

623
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,039
whatever about zero trust and forensics

624
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,900
they always come back and they're like

625
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,120
hey RIT department they don't want us to

626
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,919
be able to do this uh one of the things

627
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,659
is to be able to communicate remotely

628
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,340
with endpoints

629
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,559
and they say that that's not in

630
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,720
compliance with zero trust

631
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,600
so we talk about this minimum level

632
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,120
and so the key thing

633
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
um when talking to it is to talk kind of

634
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,980
in their language and business language

635
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,020
and you need to establish your business

636
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,940
case for why this type of access why you

637
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,679
need to be able to forensically respond

638
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,900
in these ways why you need to have

639
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,400
access at these levels and present the

640
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,340
business case or the mission critical if

641
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,880
you're more of an agency type of your

642
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,940
workflow because that is what zero trust

643
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,980
isn't about saying hey because we could

644
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,919
be Totally Secure if we just listen

645
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,539
nobody has access to the day we're just

646
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,500
going to cut it off we're going to put

647
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,940
it in a vault and you don't have access

648
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,679
you can't do anything of course your

649
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,480
business would go out you'd have other

650
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,340
bigger problems but you'd be secure

651
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,799
that's for sure

652
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,779
um so the key thing here is to present

653
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:30,539
the business case okay you've got a

654
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,000
you've gotta talk like vit man

655
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,419
and uh to to kind of soften them up and

656
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,940
get them in but this is not even that's

657
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,039
not going to be easy but the point is

658
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,679
you lay out why it's Mission critical

659
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,720
why the business case of securing your

660
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,260
network and what type of access uh you

661
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,179
have and also

662
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,520
um one thing as people come and talk to

663
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,440
me is uh hopefully laying out the

664
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,260
the um issues of what would happen if

665
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,539
they don't have that hopefully before it

666
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,240
does happen uh that's always the trick

667
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,700
is

668
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,440
implementing before you learn through

669
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,900
the School of Hard Knocks

670
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,100
so

671
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,799
once we get this data what are some of

672
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,440
the blockers that we have for reviewing

673
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,279
the data and this is something that

674
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,960
we come across a lot when talking to

675
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,020
people is forensic tools typically

676
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,659
require an installation okay that's most

677
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,480
software I can't install anything on my

678
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,480
company laptop I have to file a ticket

679
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,360
um that's fun

680
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,179
uh so creates an issue right off most

681
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,919
forensic tools require administrative

682
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
access well again admin access is almost

683
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,260
like the one thing like that is never

684
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,720
given out if your I.T or forensics you

685
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,179
may have admin access on certain boxes

686
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,820
but maybe not on others so for me I have

687
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,260
the company laptop

688
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,419
have I can't delete shortcuts off my

689
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,580
desktop and then I have a group of other

690
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,159
laptops that I have

691
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,000
um

692
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,240
you know forensic tools on admin access

693
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,539
but the trick is it does create some

694
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:14,940
hassle is I can't connect to like our

695
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,240
company Google drive with those so you

696
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,799
know I can't get my images without

697
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,200
downloading them on my company box

698
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,960
throwing them on a removable Drive which

699
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,460
I had to fight to get removable Drive

700
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,080
access for which I think is on the list

701
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,539
yep next one on the list and then

702
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,120
transfer it over so your workflows may

703
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,720
not be as optimized as they could be but

704
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,980
again remember we're trying to protect

705
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,120
our data

706
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,179
so forensic workflows uh may be required

707
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,220
to transfer data between departments

708
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,380
this was more

709
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,840
um you know something that I experienced

710
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,179
all the time in

711
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:54,059
um my law enforcement career actually uh

712
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,919
I'll be honest we weren't really

713
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,320
operating the zero trust environment uh

714
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,140
due to the forensic nature of it but how

715
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,000
many times do you have where you're

716
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,799
going to collect a bunch of data from a

717
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,380
machine you're a forensic expert you're

718
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,419
a post-breach incident response expert

719
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,100
you're a cyber security expert how many

720
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,960
of you are also accountants maybe some

721
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,460
of you

722
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,440
um I don't know anything about

723
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,360
accounting other than to make sure I'm

724
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,240
bringing in more money than I'm spending

725
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,039
uh so we would send data over to our

726
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,419
forensic accountants well how are you

727
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,500
going to do that in a zero trust

728
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,480
environment did your it Department give

729
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,600
them access to that well okay now how do

730
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,919
we how do we work through that we'll

731
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,000
talk about that

732
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,299
and then of course reviewers may change

733
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,279
um between cases I need accounting this

734
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,860
time I need Personnel next time HR or

735
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,399
whatever so uh constantly managing user

736
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,980
access can become an issue

737
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,020
so some of the ways that you can get

738
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,179
around it regardless of what tools or

739
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,520
solutions that you're using is to move

740
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,500
at least in the review maybe not

741
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,159
analysis but at least in review to a

742
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,380
cloud-based solution or a browser-based

743
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,520
solution

744
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,640
and the benefits of doing something like

745
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,100
that is that the end user all they need

746
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,039
to do is have a web browser and access

747
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,980
to the internet or intranet depending on

748
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,020
uh where it's housed and this

749
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,760
facilitates the ability for it to be

750
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,559
happy because you're not asking to give

751
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,140
admin access to anything anybody that

752
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,240
doesn't need it you're also not

753
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,880
installing more software onto machines

754
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,760
which is super happy about they don't

755
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,140
remember if we think back to our

756
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,080
applications of zero trust

757
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,419
if they have to do vulnerability scans

758
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,399
on different things and then there is a

759
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,020
vulnerability that needs to be fixed

760
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,600
within a forensic tool or a incident

761
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,399
response solution or something and it's

762
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,620
installed on everybody's machine or at

763
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,240
least a lot of machines that's a lot of

764
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,980
places to fix one Central Cloud

765
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,020
repository they can fix that really

766
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,220
quick

767
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,020
user management typically comes with

768
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,760
these so you can give access remove

769
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,000
access only when they need it okay and

770
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,100
then of course data management typically

771
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,000
when you pull data in this networked

772
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,140
environment they're going to go to a

773
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,880
centralized location somewhere that the

774
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,340
cloud can access process

775
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,260
and distribute

776
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,720
uh very easily so your data management

777
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,520
becomes more secure because you don't

778
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,559
have data floating around the office on

779
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,100
jump drives anybody still burn disks

780
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,159
yeah nobody does that uh floppies no

781
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,200
okay uh

782
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,880
and hard drives moving around your

783
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,740
office okay

784
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,539
there's also

785
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,760
um self-com contained various portable

786
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,059
cases for uh you know ftk has one magnet

787
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,159
has one uh celebrate has their uh

788
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,860
it's their reporting tool I just face

789
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,059
the name

790
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,500
um these types of things that do not

791
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,440
require any installation are also very

792
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,260
valuable Solutions because they run

793
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,020
self-contained out of a directory

794
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,740
um the uh kind of the downside to these

795
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,500
but they're still good is either you're

796
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,059
going to have to do a jump drive they

797
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,520
may not have access or you you can share

798
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,460
it through your company Cloud repository

799
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,080
uh to

800
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,240
facilitate that review

801
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,120
but again these are good kind of Middle

802
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,919
Ground

803
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:24,480
um review options and I'm talking review

804
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,220
here if you're in the forensic

805
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,899
Department

806
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,059
you're doing a deep dive analysis you

807
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:31,679
need to look at malware you need to

808
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,539
break out executables you need to look

809
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,760
at hex to recover a database in

810
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,520
forensics or data carve you're still

811
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,779
going to have your thick clients

812
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,220
installed on boxes within your

813
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,380
department and your it Department

814
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,240
hopefully will see

815
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,419
that's a necessary minimum amount of

816
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,820
access for the job but how many times do

817
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,740
we just need to review the data read

818
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,080
some documents read some emails some

819
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,480
chat logs those types of things

820
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,399
we can get around those with lighter

821
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:01,620
weight review platforms

822
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,899
um and also distribute the work as well

823
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,200
and maintain that zero trust compliance

824
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,059
so that the data can be protected but

825
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:13,679
you can still do your job

826
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,960
so yeah

827
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,440
so about five minutes

828
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,700
um on the clock but that's me uh you can

829
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,380
connect with me on LinkedIn but zero

830
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,399
trust is

831
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,380
super important because we need to

832
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,960
protect the data breaches are happening

833
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,880
it's it's kind of like put the news put

834
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,380
the new back in news they don't even

835
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,080
really re report on breaches anymore

836
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,539
because it's almost like it would be

837
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,880
more news if a breach didn't happen so

838
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,480
zero trust is going to become more and

839
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,760
more of a thing if it hasn't in your

840
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,580
company already and what you need to do

841
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,100
is get out in front of that to make sure

842
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,919
that you're still effective because we

843
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,140
can't secure the data

844
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
at the cost of

845
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,039
um

846
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,019
losing our ability to react and protect

847
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,159
the data

848
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,580
so yeah I think there's probably yep the

849
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,619
uh feedback survey and if you have any

850
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,980
questions uh slack I'm on that and then

851
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,440
of course you can reach out to me on any

852
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,650
social media platforms thank you
