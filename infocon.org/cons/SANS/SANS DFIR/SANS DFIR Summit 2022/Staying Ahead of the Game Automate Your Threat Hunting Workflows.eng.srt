1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,860
everybody I'm going to start off by

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,900
introducing myself here

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,660
um do I click to get the slide started

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,720
yeah all right so my name is Tony Bessel

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,520
I know it's not spelled traditionally

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,760
but it was like that since I was born so

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,320
um nice to meet you guys and I'm a

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,680
security engineer at Cisco my job is to

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,599
automate solutions for customers to help

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,239
them reduce their risk and complexity

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,100
today I want to share with you a couple

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,960
of techniques that I use to help

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,059
customers perform this automation

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,340
so let's get started

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,660
first we're going to do some quick

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,520
housekeeping I'm going to introduce you

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,140
guys to threat hunting which is why

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,000
we're all here right then we're going to

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
talk about security automation how it

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,020
works and how we can use it and finally

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,280
we're going to play a little game and

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,320
have a little Adventure we'll finish up

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,079
with some use cases

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,120
if I show of hands how many people here

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,920
have a definition of threat hunting in

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,059
the organization

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,559
most people should have their hands up

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,060
now how many of us have the same

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
definition

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,960
all right well the theme that you might

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,060
notice in most most of these uh

33
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,159
definitions is that we're trying to find

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,020
adversaries that have found a way to

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,240
bypass our security controls they're

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
already in our Networks

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,500
it happens I know it happens to every

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,799
customer

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,979
but the important thing that we need to

40
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,159
focus on is why do we hunt we spend a

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,140
ton of money every year to deploy

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,900
security tools depending on which uh

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,640
depending on which article that you read

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,979
the estimated cyber security Market is

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,799
between 300 and 500 billion dollars

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,500
we spend this money on tools agents and

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,180
other solutions to help us defend our

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,460
networks and prevent data breaches but

49
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,799
they still find a way in at the same

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,439
time we hear about a skill shortage and

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,619
the inability to find professionals

52
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,840
regardless of this Gap it's still the

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,619
dfir community that has the triage in a

54
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,719
triage investigate and respond to these

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,619
alerts

56
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,080
and we all know that time is money right

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
so the longer that we're investigating

58
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,879
the more money we're losing the longer

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,780
that we're they're in the net

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,819
adversaries are in the network the more

61
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,200
money that they're making

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,540
however the inverse is also true if we

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,340
can reduce that time for investigation

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,560
that's less money that we will be losing

65
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,780
in breaches and less money that the

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,860
adversaries will make

67
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,020
and when we hunt what do we hunt for

68
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,700
let's start with the simplest one which

69
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,400
is an indicator based driven hunt this

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,040
is where you take iocs such as IPS

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,080
hashes and domains and you check for

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,819
them in your environment

73
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,620
this is certainly something easy that we

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,239
can perform but it's also easy for

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,459
adversaries to modify a small little

76
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,200
change in a tool that they use will

77
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,819
change the hash value

78
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,620
we also have heard about the Pyramid of

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,420
pain and we understand that adversaries

80
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,980
can change things like they're in their

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,540
infrastructure such as domains or IP

82
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,980
addresses

83
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,099
so a more advanced type of detection is

84
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,920
TTP or tactics techniques and procedures

85
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
this is more behind the how the

86
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
adversaries are performing their actions

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
instead of what they're using

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
for this type of investigation we want

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,220
to do a perform systematic approach this

90
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,400
is also useful to to discover uh tools

91
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,540
that are in your environment that

92
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,580
shouldn't be there we saw a discussion a

93
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,379
few moments ago about TeamViewer should

94
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,180
you have that in your environment

95
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,980
some other examples of things we look

96
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,940
for in GTP driven hunting is the use of

97
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,620
things like a PDF weaponized PDFs or

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,819
fast flux domain number

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,959
and finally the most advanced type of a

100
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,000
threat Hunt is an anomaly driven hunt

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,860
this is where you collect your

102
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,099
information and you create a Baseline

103
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,540
many times we're going to be in

104
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,640
including things like machine learning

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
to create a behavioral analytics and

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,780
alert you when things have been deviated

107
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,360
today I'd like to focus on intelligence

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,739
driven threat hunts

109
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,540
a lot of our time is spent on looking at

110
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,120
our internal collection our tools our

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,979
firewall rules

112
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,020
and things that we have deployed we

113
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,699
spend a lot of this time reviewing these

114
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,259
alerts and making sure that they're true

115
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,699
positives and we want to try to

116
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,320
eliminate the false positive as much as

117
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
possible

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,380
and how do we do that well we usually

119
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,759
incorporate some type of threat

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,780
intelligence

121
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,520
that intelligence is an essential part

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,680
to every threat hunting program

123
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,940
now I want to take a moment to talk

124
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,100
about threat intelligence the most

125
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,600
important information that you can

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
collect and store on threat intelligence

127
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,040
is your previous intrusions this is the

128
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,660
most relevant information

129
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,580
because adversaries that were already in

130
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,320
your network will usually try to find a

131
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,820
way back in and if you knew how to

132
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,560
remove them the first time this is the

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,300
most important way to understand how to

134
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,740
remove them next time

135
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,240
then we also need to talk about threat

136
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,340
feed everybody out in that hall right

137
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,960
now will try to sell you a thrift feed

138
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
but not every threat feed applies to all

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,460
data sets make sure you're applying the

140
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,160
appropriate threat fee to your data set

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,660
and finally it's open source

142
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,520
intelligence places that you find like

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,900
blogs like Cisco Talus or a Twitter

144
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,520
there's lots of good use for information

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,020
out there but be careful because

146
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,759
sometimes this information is outdated

147
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,259
and again it may not apply to your

148
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,639
environment

149
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,479
foreign

150
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
using this information we can

151
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,139
cross-reference the data and determine

152
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,539
the proper course of action

153
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,300
this is the this takes up the biggest

154
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,639
portion of our time to determine what

155
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,199
should we be doing should we respond to

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,539
the malware should we be isolating the

157
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,560
host

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,660
Etc the quicker that we can get to a

159
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,699
course of action the quicker that we can

160
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,380
get the adversaries out of our

161
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,440
environment luckily this portion can be

162
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,479
automated we can reduce a large overhead

163
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,979
in our security operations center

164
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,780
not every single organization hunts the

165
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,500
same

166
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,479
when organizations start threat hunting

167
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,220
they usually start by using the tools

168
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,960
that they have deployed whether it's EDR

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,780
or Sim Solutions but they'll quickly add

170
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,460
threat intelligence to try to enrich

171
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,320
that information

172
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,199
as organizations begin to mature

173
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,900
you'll see that they start to document

174
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,319
routine procedures and or most leading

175
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,360
and most Innovation or Innovative

176
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
organizations are analyzed have

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,940
identified their analytic techniques and

178
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,500
are automating the majority of these

179
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,580
procedures

180
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,400
this is a the hunting maturity model is

181
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,139
a is a reference to the squirrel

182
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:45,360
networks which is now part of Amazon and

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,039
if you visit the QR code in the corner

184
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,919
you can read more about it

185
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,900
all right now that we've had that

186
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,819
Baseline let's understand how security

187
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,000
analytics sorry security automation can

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,400
help us out

189
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,580
we spent a lot of time using tools and

190
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,139
scripting languages to help us build

191
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,139
solutions for our our teams I myself

192
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,639
have built many projects that have

193
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,919
helped my organizations perform their

194
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,560
actions quickly quickly while these are

195
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,960
great and uh great solutions they all

196
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,240
come with their own risks I'm sure that

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,000
some of us myself included have a whole

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,039
entire project running on a single box

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,259
sitting underneath my desk

200
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,000
that's a huge risk in our environment

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,940
but you might say hey Tony we don't do

202
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,740
that we have our stuff deployed in the

203
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,960
in in data centers right we have our

204
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,460
stuff deployed in the cloud

205
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,099
well that's my point though

206
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,919
we're too busy focused on coding and

207
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,720
maintaining infrastructure when our job

208
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
is instant Incident Management in

209
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,960
forensics

210
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,039
foreign

211
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,280
not to mention that when individuals are

212
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,900
maintaining our tools for us and it's

213
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,400
not something that we're sharing it

214
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,960
creates a pocket of knowledge that

215
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,940
certain individuals might uh that that

216
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,160
they have that others don't this is a

217
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,020
huge risk to your organization because

218
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,180
when these individuals move on

219
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,919
for whatever reason they take that

220
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,479
knowledge with them and this can

221
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,300
seriously impact your environment

222
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,039
you also have to consider the the

223
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
secrets that you're using your your

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,880
tokens

225
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,860
um and other things how are you using

226
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,259
them where are they stored how are you

227
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,060
accessing them are they encrypted at

228
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,900
rest

229
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,419
you also have to understand

230
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,220
if the credentials that you're using are

231
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,900
they shared does everybody in your sock

232
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
use the same crit login for example

233
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,240
and let's not even let's talk briefly

234
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,399
about rollback Access Control

235
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,559
many times developers will remove the

236
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,039
burden to their solutions by checking

237
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,740
every box and creating an API client for

238
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,360
example that has all the permissions

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,120
while this might be a good solution not

240
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
a best practice but it might be a

241
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,959
solution for developers many times this

242
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,180
leaks into production so are you guys

243
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,180
monitoring for these kind of risks

244
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,519
and also have you thought about rotating

245
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,339
your keys how often do you do it and do

246
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,200
you have a process to revoke those keys

247
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,940
if they're compromised while in

248
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,240
production

249
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,600
and supply chain risk especially through

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,580
uh libraries and dependencies is a huge

251
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,519
risk when using open source tooling

252
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,320
many of us have heard about vulnerable

253
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,180
dependencies that have been discovered

254
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,060
even in February there was 25 or so

255
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,740
vulnerabilities discovered in the

256
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,399
official npm repo for JavaScript but

257
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,320
that's not the only one I was reading

258
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,360
that even the the package manager for

259
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
python pip even has multiple

260
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,380
vulnerabilities in it and let's not

261
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,959
forget about log 4J we're still having

262
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,240
trouble from that there's a remote code

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
execution vulnerability that's been in

264
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,279
that since 2016. this is a major Gap and

265
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,640
major risk in our assessments

266
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
most of this uh

267
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
all of this is wrapped around a

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,839
specialized skill set which is devsecops

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
which is is different than digital

270
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,700
forensics and incident response these

271
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
analysts know how to do rapid risk

272
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,500
assessments code reviews and build

273
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,180
secure pipelines like we saw on the

274
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,320
previous talk

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
now these skills are great and we want

276
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,660
to advance our our operations teams

277
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,080
however this costs time and money

278
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,180
or you could hire new staff but that

279
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,399
costs even more time and even more money

280
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,240
what I'm saying is that it's dangerous

281
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,399
to throw uh automate threat hunting

282
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,779
luckily you're not alone

283
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,320
there are new and exciting tools that

284
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,140
are available to you to help us automate

285
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,820
this and reduce the risk and in some

286
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,220
case transfer the risks to to other

287
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,079
other Solutions

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,120
for example tines and torque are new

289
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,920
players in the industry that do no to

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,959
low code Solutions this will help you

291
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,880
build workflows to automate Your

292
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,500
solution

293
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,360
The Hive is also great with some

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,980
built-in automation but it has a case

295
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,720
management built into it which is

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,399
essential for your security operations

297
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,680
team to document what they're doing and

298
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,060
to communicate

299
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,620
now if you're going to use something

300
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,899
like python make sure you're using

301
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,940
jupyter notebooks which allows you to

302
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,220
provide notes documentation and even

303
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,140
Graphics so that way you can share your

304
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,940
intentions and the reasons for your

305
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,260
tooling with everyone in the security

306
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,600
operations center and we should all be

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,360
familiar with maltigo if not let me tell

308
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,459
you real quick this is a great tool to

309
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,560
help you enrich information by using

310
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
what they call transforms this is where

311
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
you provide a single bit of information

312
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,760
like an IEP and it'll regress and

313
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,620
determine all the relevant information

314
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,560
for example from an IP address you can

315
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,480
get a domain name that domain name has

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,060
SSL certificates those SSL certificates

317
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,399
are used on other domains on other IPS

318
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,860
even though you might discover a single

319
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,380
piece of information using an enrichment

320
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,540
tool like multigo will help you map out

321
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,820
the adversary's infrastructure which is

322
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,740
super useful for your hunts because if

323
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,420
they've performed a phone home or

324
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,060
command and control to oneip Chances Are

325
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,220
they're using other infrastructure as

326
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,779
well

327
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,820
if you visit the QR code of the corner

328
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,339
it'll take you to the GitHub repo for

329
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,260
awesome store where there's a list of

330
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,240
multiple tools that I have listed here

331
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,060
as well as commercial tools like Cisco's

332
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,839
secure orchestration

333
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
great now that we know how the game is

334
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,579
played let's go ahead and get started

335
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm going to give to you guys a simple

336
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,779
three-step process I use

337
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,600
to automate most everything the first

338
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,700
thing is most important is to document

339
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,220
your procedures this is an essential

340
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,320
element and as we saw in the maturity

341
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,920
model as organizations mature they begin

342
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,680
to identify their routine tasks

343
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,079
next we need to visualize our data flow

344
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,940
and what I mean by that is we need to

345
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,800
see where our data is coming from

346
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,660
and where is it going we need to

347
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,000
identify our inputs and outputs and for

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
this I'm going to use a flowchart

349
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,740
and last you need to determine your

350
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,440
workflow categories this is essential so

351
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,720
that way you can identify what actions

352
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,220
are occurring inside of your workflow

353
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,500
and you can swap out the underlying

354
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,240
technology while maintaining the

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,459
structure of what you're performing

356
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,540
let's get started

357
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,680
all right

358
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,540
work with me here

359
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,980
theoretically

360
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,959
some researcher out there just found

361
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,540
some really Choice Cobalt strike and

362
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,160
they want to tweet about it so they post

363
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
about it on the C2 on uh their favorite

364
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,860
uh favorite social media now our

365
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,720
security operations center is tasked

366
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,620
with

367
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,839
um monitoring the social media and

368
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,399
determining if there's any observables

369
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,600
that are available

370
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,240
when an observable is found our security

371
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,279
analysts will enrich that data using

372
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,779
their threat intelligence

373
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,040
they're looking for things like

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,620
malicious ratings or high threat scores

375
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,300
that could indicate

376
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,980
trouble

377
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,959
they then search their events and logs

378
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,839
to see if there's any connections and if

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,980
there are they'll raise a ticket

380
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,320
documenting the time stamps the host

381
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,660
information and that enriched observable

382
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,040
information

383
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,600
we'll then escalate to our security

384
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,579
operations center by posting the ticket

385
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,920
into our chat room so our senior analyst

386
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,899
can pick it up perform an investigation

387
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,500
and determine that course of action

388
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,899
all right let's see what that looks like

389
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,220
if you think about what we're doing here

390
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,519
is we're taking from Twitter and pulling

391
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,320
out any things that look like

392
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,019
observables IPS and hashes but many

393
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,000
times we'll defang these by putting

394
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,680
special characters in there that

395
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,959
prevents users such as myself from

396
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,639
clicking on it and visiting the malware

397
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,019
or or going to the phone uh C2

398
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,519
after we've determined that there are

399
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,199
valid observables then we're going to

400
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,120
have to enrich it so at this point we've

401
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,639
gone from a tweet to an observable and

402
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,060
observable to enriched now depending on

403
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,339
the amount the threat rating we'll take

404
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,040
our enriched observable and go check our

405
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,620
logs and events and in the presence that

406
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,720
there is a detection we'll take the

407
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,760
enriched observable and the logs and

408
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,860
events and create a ticket now the

409
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,079
ticket itself even becomes an output for

410
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,639
our chat Ops

411
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,560
why am I talking so much about inputs

412
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,839
and outputs one of the core principles

413
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,120
of cyber security is a feedback loop and

414
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
the feedback loop goes back to the human

415
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,019
and all the automation that's occurring

416
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,760
needs to make sure that we're keeping

417
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,800
the humans involved in this case I'm

418
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
using chat Ops to notify our operations

419
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,420
team that a new tweet has just been

420
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,180
detected that is malicious and on top of

421
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,860
that we've seen multiple sightings in

422
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,180
our environment

423
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,800
quickly getting to a course of action

424
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,540
like isolating a host might be a need

425
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,740
all right now in my line of business

426
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,500
I've worked with lots of customers and

427
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,360
in the process I've come up with a

428
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,060
couple of high level categories now

429
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,279
these categories are not exclusive

430
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,019
meaning that your categories are

431
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,660
probably different than mine and they're

432
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,120
um a workflow might actually belong to

433
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,399
one or multiple categories

434
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,959
let's go ahead and take each of these in

435
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,160
order

436
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
first of all is the hunt category this

437
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,660
is essential for identifying hidden

438
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,459
threats in your environment for example

439
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,040
an IP address that that matches a hash

440
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,139
this is great for finding those hidden

441
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,120
threats in your environment

442
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
um and uh I use this one a lot

443
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,399
second of all is the correlate category

444
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,380
this is useful when you have more than

445
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,600
one asset especially in this remote

446
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,300
world where we're working not in office

447
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,639
you might have more than one device in

448
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,079
fact I have a work laptop that's

449
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,940
assigned to me but I also have a desktop

450
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,160
back at home I also have a phone that I

451
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,440
use for work if my password was

452
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,240
compromised and I had to reset my

453
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,880
password or my phone gets lost as a

454
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,740
security analyst you need to know how

455
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,019
wide your exposure is but it's a really

456
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,699
great category

457
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,759
next is the track category this category

458
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,859
I like to use to find threats that go

459
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,199
under the radar for example

460
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,260
if I had a failed login attempt I typed

461
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,240
in my password wrong sure but if that

462
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,919
failed login attempt has been occurring

463
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,959
every single day for the last 30 days

464
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,480
and on nights and weekends you might

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,099
have yourself a Brute Force attempt that

466
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:23,240
you just weren't seeing

467
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,079
next is the document and notify

468
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,419
categories this is the ways that we keep

469
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,700
our humans involved it's our feedback

470
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,940
loop versus the document category with

471
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,000
this category we document our findings

472
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,340
and our investigations as we're

473
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,100
progressing such as creating tickets or

474
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,840
putting enriched information into our

475
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,100
case books

476
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,380
but don't forget notify notify separate

477
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,480
because it lets the user know that some

478
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,580
action occurred whether automation

479
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,539
occurred or you need to push an approval

480
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,460
have you guys ever seen dual pushes

481
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,620
that's a notification that you're trying

482
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,840
to log in that's that feedback loop I'm

483
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
talking about again

484
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,340
and last is the response category this

485
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,840
is a category that's useful for any

486
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,880
actions that are complicated or prone to

487
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,140
human error

488
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,880
things that I use response categories

489
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,059
for are like isolating a host moving a

490
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,880
server to a new VLAN or updating uh

491
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,460
Cisco umbrella when the for for blocking

492
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,860
your DNS command and controls I've also

493
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,120
heard other talks where people were

494
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,500
saying that certain actions are

495
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,720
reoccurring and it's overly complicated

496
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,340
they don't want to have errors the

497
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,200
respond category would be perfect for

498
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,340
you in that case

499
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,460
great so in our adventure

500
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,520
how do our analysts

501
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,320
or how do our security Engineers perform

502
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,380
threat hunting well let's check some of

503
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,700
the Strange Magic in play

504
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,660
all right so it's our good friend

505
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,740
Twitter

506
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,120
I'm going to show you this example

507
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,980
because it helps us

508
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,840
um people uh

509
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,299
security analysts use use Twitter to

510
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,100
post information to share with the

511
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,960
community I'm going to be looking at the

512
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,240
opendir hashtag for those of you that

513
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,940
don't know it's used by a dozen or so

514
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,919
researchers to post fresh indicators of

515
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,660
compromise in their environment

516
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,179
by following this hashtag you're able to

517
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,100
get these indicators as soon as they

518
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,140
post them and check for them in your

519
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,600
environment but opendir isn't the only

520
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,640
one for example if you're worried about

521
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,400
spam the emotech has a lot of good

522
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,980
information and there's an at Cold broad

523
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,780
strike user which puts out great

524
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,160
information

525
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,740
now understanding the format in these is

526
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,500
important because not every time uh not

527
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
every

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,679
not every post is going to have an

529
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,720
indicator in it for example sometimes

530
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,120
they they push off to like paste bin or

531
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,700
something like that okay so

532
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,940
um find the things that work for you

533
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
um

534
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,039
Let's uh let's take a look at this this

535
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,080
is what I call a retro hunt

536
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,460
um this is to go back to your

537
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,039
information and determine if anywhere in

538
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,720
your environment

539
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,919
um you see prevalence of information

540
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,140
this is how we uncover

541
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,780
um uncover hidden enemies

542
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,340
so in this case we're going to take the

543
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,860
tweets from opendir and parse them like

544
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,020
I was telling you here

545
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,700
next we're going to send this

546
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,380
information to our endpoint solution

547
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,900
tool at Cisco we have a secure endpoint

548
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,320
tool which runs a fork of os query and

549
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
that allows us to actually assess the

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,520
environment in lifetime

551
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,380
lots of these endpoint tools that you

552
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,240
assess in lifetime have a slight DeLay

553
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,940
So in this case after we wait for the

554
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,679
information to come back we're going to

555
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,539
check to see if our endpoint tool has

556
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,400
discovered anything

557
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,380
in the event that there is a discovery

558
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,120
we're going to document this in a ticket

559
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,340
and escalate to our senior security

560
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,760
staff using slack in this example

561
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,820
however if there was no citing occurred

562
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,140
we're not just going to throw this

563
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,200
indicator away in this workflow I update

564
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,059
a watch list of my endpoint tool to

565
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,460
alert us automatically in the event that

566
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,960
one of our endpoints do make a

567
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,299
connection to one of these indicators

568
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,280
and again I'm posting that information

569
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,080
to slack so we're keeping our feedback

570
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,940
alive

571
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,980
Isn't that cool

572
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,580
all right

573
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,799
well

574
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,440
I think that that workflow is pretty oh

575
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,940
let's go back so we could talk about it

576
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,740
this workflow has a couple of categories

577
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,380
let's talk about that we have the hunt

578
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,299
category that we're using we also have

579
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:36,059
the document and the notify categories

580
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,220
what I like about this workflow is that

581
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,740
it's flexible and it saves time and more

582
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,240
importantly it's not running underneath

583
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
my desk anymore

584
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,280
all right now we'll go on to the next

585
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,600
one

586
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,960
um I want to show you how you can uh

587
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,299
reduce your alert fatigue

588
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,460
I don't know how many times I've looked

589
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,700
at an alert and a review to review a

590
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,340
firewall and determine that it's just

591
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,620
the source IP from a security researcher

592
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,500
that's the that's just investigating a

593
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,720
new vulnerability but they don't have

594
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,480
any real malicious intent and for that

595
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
matter how do you determine intent

596
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,860
especially on the internet

597
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,840
well I'd like to introduce you guys to

598
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,820
gray noise if you don't know about it

599
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,919
already it's a great tool

600
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,140
um the UI is free and so I'm showing you

601
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,640
this here

602
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,919
gray noise is a sensor Network that

603
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,200
collects scans against internet-facing

604
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,780
IPS it then analyzes this information

605
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,659
and provides context in the form of tags

606
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,860
and labels

607
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,860
these labels include things such as PHP

608
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,159
invoke function or Confluence scan or

609
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,360
Hadoop yarn worm they also have tags for

610
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,520
malicious or unknown or benign

611
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,900
Greenways also contains two separate

612
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,419
databases that they can label Riot and

613
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,059
noise the riot database is an acronym

614
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,700
and it stands for rule it out and this

615
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,039
is for legitimate businesses that you

616
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,980
can ignore such as Google's DNS or

617
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,539
cloudflare's DNS

618
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,179
where where the noise category is used

619
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,580
for scanners that you can ignore such as

620
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,039
Showdown and senses while we should

621
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,559
certainly block these categories we

622
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,380
don't need to spend much time on it

623
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,480
let's go see how we can use gray noise

624
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,500
in a workflow

625
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,539
in this workflow I'm going to show you

626
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,840
how to reduce your alert fatigue by

627
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,000
removing false positives and at the same

628
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,919
time reduce the investigation required

629
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,840
for your analyst

630
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,059
let's begin

631
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,340
this workflow is configured to run every

632
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,620
hour and it pulls the last hour's worth

633
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,880
of tickets

634
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,980
it then filters those tickets down to

635
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,659
just the alerts that have firewall

636
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,880
information in it and it pulls out the

637
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,159
IP addresses we then take those IP

638
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,720
addresses and submit them to gray noise

639
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,140
on their quick API I'm using the quick

640
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,000
API because it'll let you know if the

641
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,460
host is on the riot or the noise

642
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,500
database or if it isn't found on either

643
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,600
of those

644
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,880
if an IP address is found on either of

645
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,220
these databases we want to call the gray

646
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,919
noise context API and pull in on as much

647
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,440
information as we can we then update the

648
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,600
ticket that we just pulled and notify

649
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,580
our security operations center

650
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,799
that there's a no log this ticket is no

651
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
longer needed in fact in this workflow I

652
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,700
have actually marked the ticket to close

653
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,500
itself and then we're letting our team

654
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,840
know that it's completely completed

655
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,360
however in the event that it's not on

656
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,760
the riot or the noise database then

657
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,320
we're going to want to get the context

658
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,419
as well as all the tags that Greenwich

659
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,640
has collected on this IP

660
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,400
we then combine that information update

661
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,260
our ticket and notify our Operation

662
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,520
Center

663
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,799
unless there's a malicious tag then we

664
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,720
go down the third path right there where

665
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,299
we update the tag but then assign this

666
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,059
ticket to our senior security staff

667
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:05,100
and then we notify them that of the

668
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,200
investigation and the need to respond

669
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Isn't that cool

670
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,880
this workflow contains

671
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,059
the hunt as well as a aggregate I would

672
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,159
have called it combined category it also

673
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,559
contains the document and notify

674
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,659
I like this workflow because it'll help

675
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,400
you reduce the amount of time your

676
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,000
investigators need to to invent uh

677
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,220
to get the contacts right and then it

678
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,020
also helps you not have to worry about

679
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,299
tickets that I spend so much time on to

680
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,580
find out that I can close them so this

681
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,559
is really really powerful and I hope you

682
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,158
guys enjoyed it

683
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,520
well I think this little Bobby comic

684
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,000
sums up our talk quite well because even

685
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,039
if we are trying to automate threat

686
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,380
hunting we got to remember to keep the

687
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,900
humans involved look I'm not trying to

688
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,760
Advocate that to replace anybody's job

689
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,980
around here in fact security automation

690
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,600
isn't trying to take anybody's job away

691
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,520
it's trying to help you do the more fun

692
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,220
things because if we took away all the

693
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,559
boring stuff like looking at Twitter all

694
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,980
day you wouldn't be out of a job right

695
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,480
plus your boss doesn't want you looking

696
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,440
at Twitter all day no way

697
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
all right

698
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,820
so in conclusion I'd sleeve you with a

699
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,159
couple of points here threat hunting is

700
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,559
about finding those adversaries that are

701
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,820
in your network that have already

702
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,220
bypassed your controls

703
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,840
while threat intelligence will help you

704
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,940
enrich this information and get to the

705
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,380
point that you can determine a course of

706
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,840
action as quick as possible and security

707
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,299
automation is a great way and there's

708
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:40,980
lots of tools out there to help you

709
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,559
reduce that risk and the complexity to

710
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,720
tie it all together

711
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,840
look I do this all day using that

712
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,820
three-step process I just showed you and

713
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,380
I love it when customers come to me and

714
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,840
say Tony you've saved me time or I don't

715
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,279
have to look at this category of tickets

716
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:57,779
anymore

717
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,360
I hope that this example and these steps

718
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,159
that I've given you will help you

719
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,220
um in your organizations and I'm open to

720
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,140
talking to anybody if they're if they

721
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,860
have any questions

722
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,539
you can reach me at GitHub I've got

723
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,059
LinkedIn and then I'm crazy I guess I

724
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,700
put my personal email on there but

725
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,659
um

726
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,700
yeah thank you guys for coming out

727
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,320
