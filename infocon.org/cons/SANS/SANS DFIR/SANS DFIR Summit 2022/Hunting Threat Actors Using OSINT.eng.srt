1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,580
hi everyone my name is Abby Waddell um I

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,260
currently work as a digital forensics

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,360
managing consultant and I'm also the

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,580
founder of inquirics which provides

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,039
research and services on OC

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,380
vulnerability assessments primarily for

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,699
non-profits

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,859
I'm going to talk to you about some open

10
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,080
source intelligence techniques to locate

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,420
the source of cyber breaches and the

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,939
identity of cyber crime and non-cyber

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,800
crime suspects that have been used

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,399
successfully

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,440
um so why ocean so breach Recon

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,660
activities are not usually captured by

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,300
existing tools and methods either pre or

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
post incident mainly because such

19
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,020
activities occur away from the corporate

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,480
Network and what if you don't have a

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,579
physical device uh belonging to the

22
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,160
suspect so async Gathering can be put

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,140
into different categories according to

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,660
the type of repository of data the

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,059
expected levels of permission and the

26
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,760
level of sensitivity so categories can

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,500
include anything that's freely available

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,200
to the public data that's only meant to

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
be shared with a specific group for

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,740
instance most free deep websites

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,320
information that requires an applied for

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,060
account in order to access it such

33
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,400
accounts require payment and or further

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,640
screening Beyond a simple device

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,380
verification for example paid for news

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,960
or media sites subscription sites and

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
then there's the data which is out in

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,280
the open but shouldn't be for example

39
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,259
um which is usually from unintentional

40
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,299
leakage so an example could be that I

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,360
email a hotel reception about my room

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,240
booking but they reply to me including

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,640
the email of a different customer by

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,280
mistake or a web a web page is

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,860
misconfigured and shows a list of hidden

46
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,840
files and directories which anyone can

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,579
access if they are technically able to

48
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,920
find them as configured URL so I'll talk

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
about some methods useful methods of

50
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,700
obtaining information from documents

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,579
social media password leak repositories

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,159
um and uh websites and forums with some

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,200
examples of how for actors have been

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
identified using these methods which

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,038
have been developed from years of

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,780
research and original discovery

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,200
so firstly I'm going to discuss some

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
little tricks to reveal hidden material

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,980
just to note that any blue rectangles

60
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,720
covering the stuff in this present

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,220
presentation are for reduction and

62
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,500
privacy purposes along with any other

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,879
changes that have been made to the

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,640
viewable data so for user profiles

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,580
images in Instagram and Twitter it's

66
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,620
sometimes possible to reveal the parts

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,840
of the image hidden by the way the image

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,120
is presented on these platforms so not

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,580
everyone's profile photos show allow

70
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,200
this to be done but when they do it can

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,720
sometimes reveal useful information so

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,300
in the example on the left this person's

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,360
neck tattoos are revealed very useful if

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,000
there is a need for identification the

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,819
example on the right shows more clearly

76
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,099
the woman standing next to this user's

77
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,560
photo so it's very simple to view the

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
entire image to save it locally and open

79
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,940
it up from there or you can open the

80
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,739
photo from the platform in a separate

81
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,340
browser window

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,440
another useful trick is to be able to

83
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,440
view a PDF file before any edits have

84
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,019
been made using editing tools so on the

85
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,360
left is a PDF of an invoice from Amazon

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,540
and on the right key details of the same

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,360
document have been altered in order to

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,940
forge the invoice amount details and the

89
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,379
delivery recipient

90
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,140
so the edge browser PDF editing tool was

91
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,599
used to do this if one opens this

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,120
document in Google Docs however not

93
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,580
Google drive but Google the preview but

94
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,040
the Google Docs then this strips away

95
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,260
these edits so you can see the document

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,019
as it was before the changes were made

97
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,120
foreign

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,379
screenshots and images within Microsoft

99
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,360
files such as PowerPoint Exxon where

100
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,220
documents can reveal the portions of the

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,440
area deleted but not completely removed

102
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,540
so low classification files can

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,860
therefore still present a risk of

104
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,840
sensitive data leakage leading to

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
reputational damage and so on so

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,860
examples of sensitive data should be

107
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,139
anything could be anything sorry visible

108
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,839
on one's desktop at the time of either

109
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,540
performing the screenshot or using

110
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,639
images such as internal web directories

111
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,340
in the URL visible in the browser staff

112
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,300
personal details calendar entries

113
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,220
contents of open sensitive files and so

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,840
on so in this way one can use this

115
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,100
technique to find out more about the

116
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,780
author and origin of any Microsoft

117
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,960
created media that's under assessment so

118
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,460
this is an example of how this happens

119
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,860
so the screenshot of the inquirics logo

120
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,800
is taken note the surrounding views of

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,100
open websites and other documents The

122
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,780
Unwanted parts of the image are crops

123
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,460
but then the user forgets to actively

124
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,680
delete these crop to pass so this is an

125
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
easy mistake to make because it requires

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,820
remembering to do this and manually

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,400
doing this step in the application and

128
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,580
there's no software control

129
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,539
that does this automatically

130
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,540
so this is a nifty-free tool which can

131
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,759
be obtained on the inquirics site it

132
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,919
reveals those parts and screenshots in

133
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:18,960
Microsoft files which have been cropped

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,060
but not fully deleted so you don't need

135
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,340
to install anything and you only need

136
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,039
Microsoft Excel installed with any

137
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,100
third-party add-ins disabled so you

138
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,720
basically just very simply upload any

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
files you want checked it will extract

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
all the images save them to a results

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,000
file and then you can view these images

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
which will show the full screenshot with

143
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,440
any undeleted areas so as can be seen

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,020
from this example the deleted or crop

145
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,539
parts of this image are revealed and the

146
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,639
yellow box surrounds what was intended

147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
to be viewed but instead the whole

148
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,940
screenshot prior to any cropping can be

149
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,160
seen so restricting editing rights

150
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,620
within Microsoft in the Microsoft

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,660
program won't prevent this and there's

152
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,380
no patch

153
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,880
so one useful method of getting internal

154
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,259
on suspects is to use the account

155
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,240
recovery function on applications as

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,340
this sometimes reveals user details such

157
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,740
as email addresses usernames and device

158
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,240
details

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,100
um it requires attempting to log into

160
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,960
the website using the suspect's email

161
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,840
address or username and then seeing what

162
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,240
information comes back so it's the

163
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,039
offline equivalent of knocking on the

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,780
front door of a suspect's house and

165
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,580
seeing who answers so there's no

166
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,039
trespass or account compromise necessary

167
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,080
the examples here show the information

168
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,660
returned on Facebook and Gmail when one

169
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,520
goes through the steps to reset these

170
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,039
users passwords their passwords are not

171
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,319
actually reset and as you would stop the

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,360
process at this point as it's enough to

173
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,060
get the information shown namely partial

174
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,740
email addresses and device phone numbers

175
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,660
and often it's possible to guess the

176
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,660
redacted emails even having the last two

177
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,819
digits and even having the last two

178
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,860
digits of the phone number can help

179
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,960
cooperate information held elsewhere

180
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,259
and the same method can be done on many

181
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,539
applications for example the UK's

182
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,539
British Telecom BT website only a

183
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,340
username or phone number can be guessed

184
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,599
here to get the redacted information

185
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,560
likewise Microsoft Office provides this

186
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,440
kind of user data and is useful is a

187
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,759
very useful Source because it appears

188
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,860
most of the world's computer users have

189
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,080
a Microsoft account so Twitter allows

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,759
the guessing of someone's username which

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,039
is useful and here is one of the UK's

192
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,199
main Banks providing Clues as to the

193
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,300
length of a user's password so the

194
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,860
user's NatWest customer account number

195
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,840
which is made up of the of their date of

196
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
birth is needed it's needed to log into

197
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,759
their NatWest account on the website and

198
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,259
then without needing to know any other

199
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,699
information and you don't even need

200
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,620
their password one can see how many

201
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,660
characters their password has when the

202
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,940
application

203
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,340
requests various characters to be

204
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
entered from this password so knowing

205
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,660
the length of this word can help guess

206
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,759
their current password using previously

207
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,039
leaked password data and this password

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,020
is likely to be used on other sites

209
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,120
where the user has reused it obviously

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
this is more applicable to those who

211
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,259
have a legal Badge of authority to get

212
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,240
into a particular suspect's device

213
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,419
so one way of tracing or profiling

214
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,039
suspects is to look for matches of the

215
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,020
writing they use so this is an example

216
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,360
of running a search of the exact wording

217
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,120
used on the user profile of an advert of

218
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,580
a particular malware vendor on Alpha Bay

219
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,320
um which is then uh

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,599
which then gave some results of other

221
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,420
black market sites that he was using so

222
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,459
in this case the wording of his terms

223
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,440
and conditions are exactly the same on

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
these other banking hack sites and it's

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,320
also useful to determine the gender of

226
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,820
the user by analyzing their writing

227
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,920
through an online analysis tool such as

228
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,699
gender guesser

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,880
so whilst this is not strictly ocean

230
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,600
um

231
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,399
for those who already have legal access

232
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,200
to a suspect's account there are some

233
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
sites worth exploring to get a better

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,860
picture of their activities and their

235
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,260
location so grammarly profiles may show

236
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,820
draft documents even with the free

237
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,260
version and these documents might

238
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,700
contain personal details and other

239
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,760
metadata Fitness and sat nav apps can

240
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,019
obviously show a user's location

241
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,140
including historic locations not just in

242
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,060
their vehicles but if they set up

243
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,180
walking or jogging routes Hotel train

244
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,220
and flight booking sites are also good

245
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,140
for location data

246
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,640
um it's also useful to link their

247
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,899
current credit cards with physical

248
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,120
addresses in use so current email

249
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,000
addresses as well I would estimate that

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,300
the vast majority of users in the UK and

251
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,440
certainly in probably most other

252
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,180
countries are registered on any one of

253
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,519
the the Tesco or your equivalent

254
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
countries big Supermarket Amazon BBC and

255
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,260
the Netflix sites

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,860
so understanding the sites where a

257
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,240
suspect is registered can help with

258
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,100
profiling them for instance if they have

259
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,920
accounts on lifestyle and clothing sites

260
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
they're more likely to be women women

261
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,580
make up 90 of the users on the popular

262
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,399
mom's net site site registrations on

263
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,620
Sports sites tend to be uh point to a

264
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,860
higher likelihood of the user being male

265
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,660
parking apps May point to use or

266
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,120
ownership of a car and school sites like

267
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
parent payables just will show if they

268
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
have kids National Train and phone

269
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,680
company sites uh registrations May point

270
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,140
to a country of origin so just to

271
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,700
reiterate that in these cases we're

272
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,440
looking to profile not just cyber

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,540
criminals but those who have committed

274
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,519
other crimes such as drug trafficking

275
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,440
robbery murder and so on

276
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,300
um there's some techniques that can be

277
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,920
used to discover the person behind a

278
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
forum pseudonym in the Forum search area

279
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,760
you can do a search for the username

280
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,500
plus the first two digits of the

281
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,180
commonly used phone prefix for your

282
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,120
country for instance Sami one and zero

283
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,640
seven so this may bring up uh the

284
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,200
person's phone number in this case the

285
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,820
mobile number and then search can be

286
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,740
done on the entire number in Google and

287
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,220
so on in some instances users mention uh

288
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,079
their email address in their messages so

289
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,600
a search for the at symbol is worthwhile

290
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,399
it's noticeable that people are much

291
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,440
more cautious about mentioning their

292
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,060
personal details in recent years than

293
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,160
before so it pays to research the oldest

294
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,680
messages as well as the new ones where a

295
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,480
user may have been more likely to

296
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,000
divulge personal information

297
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,740
another technique is to search for the

298
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,959
username plus the words for sale are

299
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
wanted because if this user has

300
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
mentioned buying or selling they

301
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,720
sometimes give Clues as to where they

302
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,760
live so even a mention of a HomeTown

303
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,800
maybe enough to cross much this with

304
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,680
their username to lead to results uses

305
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,260
Avatar or motto in their intro on Bio

306
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,940
Section could provide further Clues as

307
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,459
to who they are and some users mention

308
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,920
landmarks near to where they live and it

309
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,600
sometimes becomes a simple case of

310
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
deduction using online maps to work out

311
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,040
their location so we had one real

312
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,899
example recently a user mentioned in

313
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,120
various posts and at various times over

314
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,980
the years that he lived equidistant to

315
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,500
three Alternative Energy Farms two miles

316
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,720
south of the specific River next to a

317
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,459
railway Line near a newly built

318
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,980
supermarket and with a close view of a

319
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,740
famous specific famous landmark so then

320
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,839
it was possible to triangulate with 95

321
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,220
accuracy whose home address

322
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,380
another useful technique is to

323
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,420
scrutinize any uploaded media for

324
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,399
instance images sometimes these images

325
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,040
are hosted on another server where their

326
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,720
username which may be different to the

327
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,920
one they have on the Forum that you're

328
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,079
looking at is visible in the URL and

329
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,820
further searches of this username on

330
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,680
Google and popular deep websites May

331
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,560
then point to their real life identity

332
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,839
often informed discussions especially

333
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,399
with users who have been on the Forum a

334
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,959
while who have made a lot of posts the

335
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,060
other users May address this user by

336
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,740
their real name either because they've

337
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,600
met in person or because they've engaged

338
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,639
in a lot of private messaging so in one

339
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,500
actual case a user of Interest was given

340
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,420
a nickname by another user based on his

341
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,820
surname because he knew who he was a

342
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,260
Google search was then run on this

343
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,700
nickname which then led to easy

344
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,740
discovery of his real name and then

345
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,720
obviously uh by the by this tone

346
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,300
searches can be made in the form for the

347
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,000
user for the username plus the sign off

348
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
words and abbreviations are sometimes

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
they're usable let's slip their real

350
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,620
first name so for example sami1 and ATB

351
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,980
for all the best or thanks or THX or

352
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,720
take care and so on and sometimes they

353
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120
let slip their their actual first name

354
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,720
um yeah

355
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,820
um the Skype online directory is a

356
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,380
useful place to find Details such as

357
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,240
alternative usernames country location

358
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,180
and images and less useful but still

359
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,100
worth knowing uh torrent file names

360
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,720
which sometimes give away the user's

361
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,639
operating system and username in the

362
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,060
directory

363
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,579
and as mentioned before one should

364
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,019
always check links to media and other

365
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,300
sites uh from foreign posters these can

366
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,040
also give alternative usernames such as

367
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,779
in this example where this particular

368
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,459
user had a different username on the

369
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,420
photo bucket site

370
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,320
and this is just to quickly highlight

371
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,060
the benefits of using Bing Maps over

372
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,639
Google Maps so these are images example

373
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,920
images of the same two map locations and

374
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,420
you can see how Bing Maps shows the

375
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,220
colors in detail much more so it's

376
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,380
always worth using Bing for ocean type

377
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,620
work

378
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,019
Facebook is often a valuable information

379
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,420
source and this highlights uh useful

380
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,519
methods of doing this so unlike the

381
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,440
search functionality on most websites

382
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,180
where there are more results with fewer

383
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,399
search criteria Facebook search produces

384
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,779
more results the more the search

385
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,760
parameters are defined for instance a

386
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,260
search can be made of a standard phone

387
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,720
prefix with the option to just look for

388
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,540
content posted by that user checked and

389
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,339
this will sometimes bring up past posts

390
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,199
that the users the user has made

391
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,940
mentioning their full phone number on

392
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,740
which further searches on other

393
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,839
platforms can be made which in turn can

394
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,399
lead to finding out their other personal

395
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,339
details to find employees working for a

396
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,959
specific company as before the more the

397
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,180
search is defined the the greater the

398
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,940
results so the example shows uh here so

399
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,180
it shows um all those who say in their

400
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,800
profile they work for Electronic Arts

401
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,779
and whose name contains the letter s

402
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:27,180
checking the profile name as shown in

403
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,279
the URL of a profile is worthwhile as

404
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,839
this can show a person's maiden name

405
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,560
their middle name nickname and also

406
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,079
point to the fact that the profile might

407
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,500
be fake

408
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,180
um this is another example of having to

409
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,279
add more search parameters in order to

410
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,940
get any results so a search here for

411
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,500
obeda212 in this example comes back with

412
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,199
no exact match but refining the search

413
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,480
for instance as in this case specifying

414
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
a year produces an exact match along

415
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,699
with a tweeted post from Twitter on

416
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,500
Twitter itself this post has actually

417
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,139
been deleted but it was actually deleted

418
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,360
but it's still partially visible on

419
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,880
Facebook so Facebook's useful place for

420
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,019
finding deleted tweets

421
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,420
it's useful to know how to construct

422
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
queries manually when the search

423
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,019
parameters need to be more defined so

424
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,579
searches are made up of parameters which

425
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,459
are then base64 encoded locations and

426
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,620
user IDs have their own ID number as

427
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,500
shown in these examples location IDs can

428
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,360
be found by running any search query

429
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,579
using the platform search function and

430
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:34,860
entering the location of choice which

431
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,620
after the base64 string and the URL can

432
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,139
be decoded to get the specific numeric

433
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,019
ID for that location and one can

434
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,839
retrieve a user ID by viewing the HTML

435
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,699
source code of the profile of interest

436
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,579
and search in the source code for the

437
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,000
user ID

438
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,779
foreign

439
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,419
so um this gives an example of a search

440
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,119
query uh so the word top here means all

441
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,520
categories such as posts people or

442
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,319
photos but you could just have a single

443
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,520
category

444
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,100
um the Q equals is followed by a keyword

445
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,040
and in this case it's knitting then the

446
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,020
filters parameter which refines the

447
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,020
query can include a user ID location ID

448
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,720
and exact date and the query is then

449
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,419
base64 encoded and run from the URL

450
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:48,000
so to find contacts of a user who has

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
prevented others from seeing their

452
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,059
friends list one can view any photos

453
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,760
images and videos that may be present in

454
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,340
their profile and view the list of users

455
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,799
who have reacted to them via the likes

456
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,840
loves comments and so on so with the

457
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,640
list of friends it's useful especially

458
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,700
if you have a case um in the case of a

459
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,160
man as they do not usually change their

460
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,140
surname after marriage to search for any

461
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,360
users who have the same surname as the

462
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,120
user so as they're highly likely to be

463
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,280
family members so researching family

464
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,740
members can then help to build a fuller

465
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,020
picture of this user

466
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,640
um and where there are lots of photos in

467
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,500
the profile of interest it's useful to

468
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,140
check only those pictures which have a

469
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,640
higher likelihood of having a greater

470
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,740
number of users react with them rather

471
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,299
than having to Wade through hundreds of

472
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,580
photos which have minimal user reactions

473
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,679
so in general there are certain types of

474
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,620
photos with which attract more user

475
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,419
response than others though photos

476
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,000
showing close-ups of the face generally

477
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,799
generally receive a higher number of

478
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,559
user reactions as do photo as do

479
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,080
pictures of special occasions

480
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,539
um or like such as weddings and

481
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,820
ceremonies and people wearing smart or

482
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,980
attractive looking clothing and finally

483
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,059
studio quality images

484
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,080
it's often useful to discern whether a

485
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,120
social media account is fake so fake

486
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,860
profiles on Facebook and to a lesser

487
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,140
extent other social media sites tend to

488
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,059
have the following Hallmarks and the

489
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,500
greater number of these characteristics

490
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,880
than the greater likelihood the profile

491
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,880
is not genuine so uh the join or first

492
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,039
post date is relatively recent So within

493
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,840
the last few weeks or months it's

494
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,940
possible to back date or hide Facebook

495
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,220
posts and so using the app that we've

496
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,660
created which I'll mention in the next

497
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,640
slide this can help to find the actual

498
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,460
date a profile was created the profile

499
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,500
name is different to the profile name as

500
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,419
seen in the URL as previously mentioned

501
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,980
this usually means that the name has

502
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,360
been changed from what it originally was

503
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,679
which could have been the user's real

504
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,480
name or the name of an account bought

505
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,780
from a third party the likes photos and

506
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,820
posts are on a single topic fake

507
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,100
profiles especially those created for a

508
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,960
single purpose are usually dominated by

509
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,179
one overriding theme for instance if the

510
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,100
profile was created to Market a

511
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,840
particular brand of lawnmower there

512
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,100
would be predominantly photos of

513
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,720
lawnmowers and likes around specific

514
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,780
gardening and tools businesses but to

515
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,820
the exclusion of much else as such you

516
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,620
wouldn't find photos of the kids the

517
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,840
family holidays mentions of other topics

518
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,360
and so on and the profile photo may even

519
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,919
represent that particular topic rather

520
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,020
than being of a person

521
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,059
um the posts and photos go over the top

522
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,340
so if if the fake profile belongs to

523
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,480
someone who's Keen to show the world

524
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,520
that they are of a certain View and or

525
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,140
of a certain type their photos mentions

526
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,179
and likes us with um the point before

527
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,980
will often be single themed but also

528
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,299
exaggerated

529
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,919
perhaps to encourage others to believe

530
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,660
that they conform to a standard social

531
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,520
stereotype and this is particularly in

532
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,440
the case of those whose strong views May

533
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,179
incur a lot of reactionary behavior from

534
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,860
others

535
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,960
um there are no posts or photos or other

536
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,820
content so an empty profile may just

537
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,260
mean that they haven't got around to

538
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,660
populating the sections yet or it may be

539
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,700
a profile which only needs to be a Bare

540
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,919
Bones one to fit a singular or temporary

541
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,360
purpose

542
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,340
the person's age does not Accord with

543
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,960
the profile content so there was an

544
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,120
example of a fake a fake account scene

545
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,620
recently where the person was pretending

546
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,720
to be a 19 year old man but he said he

547
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,580
was dating a college age woman who had a

548
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,520
name which was common in the 1960s

549
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,780
um the friends are from a different

550
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,059
culture location and possibly language

551
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,440
which is more obvious when a Facebook

552
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,760
account has been bought from a third

553
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,780
party

554
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,640
there are no friends who have the same

555
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,679
surname so most normal profiles have

556
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:25,320
some family members shown as friends and

557
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,580
if there are no other friends showing

558
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,080
the same surname this may point to the

559
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,340
account being fake

560
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,140
the presence of links to friends whose

561
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,179
profiles are also fake uh particularly

562
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:34,980
common if many of them are engaged in

563
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,600
contentious activities

564
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,580
a reverse image search reveals the

565
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,320
presence of the same image on other

566
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,260
sites so this is a fake accounts may use

567
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,500
stock images from Google and so on

568
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,960
profile pictures which do not show a

569
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,820
clear image of the face

570
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,679
depending on the purpose of the account

571
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,780
the presence of a thousand or more

572
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,419
friends or under 20 friends May point to

573
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,880
the account being fake so two for too

574
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,679
few friends May indicate that it was a

575
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,900
recently created account and too many

576
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,220
maybe due to the fact that the account

577
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,080
has been bought secondhand or is being

578
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,520
used for a single purpose such as

579
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,020
marketing or sales

580
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,340
if the account has been bought

581
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,080
secondhand there are there is more

582
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,820
likely to be inconsistencies in the

583
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,220
about section of the profile so one

584
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,900
should look at the location and timing

585
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,039
of events to see if there's anything

586
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,360
unusual

587
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,340
if there's no reply to private messages

588
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,740
then this may point to the presence of a

589
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,120
bot created account or an account

590
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,159
created for a single purpose for

591
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,919
instance putting likes on other pages

592
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,260
and single instances of of all of this

593
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,940
doesn't necessarily mean that the

594
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,039
account is fake it's just any one of

595
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,960
these factors would not ring alarm Bells

596
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,640
it's when you have lots of them together

597
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,900
it becomes suspicious

598
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,440
the Facebook LinkedIn joined a estimator

599
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,059
tool which you can download for free

600
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,220
from our site can ascertain with 98

601
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,919
accuracy the data profile was created on

602
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,440
these platforms to within the closest 60

603
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,780
days it's been updated since the slide

604
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,640
so now has a different user interface so

605
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,500
you basically enter the target profile's

606
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,840
name and their join date will come back

607
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
instantly a profile's join date is not

608
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,580
is not readily available even sometimes

609
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,039
to the owner of a profile it's only by

610
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,840
cross-matching the platform's user ID

611
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,419
number with the dates in the app can a

612
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,700
user's join date be discovered if a

613
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,039
suspect profile has a join date that is

614
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,260
very recent or much more recent than

615
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,120
their stated posts and this may point to

616
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,379
the profile being fake

617
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,799
it's worth exploring um the chain of

618
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,539
contacts in a profile of interest in

619
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,940
order to generate further profile leads

620
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,039
so as already mentioned on many profiles

621
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,299
it will not be possible to see the

622
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:43,919
friends list of someone because the

623
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,380
access level is restricted in such cases

624
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,880
it's possible to retrieve some of the

625
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,100
target profiles contacts through the

626
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,620
image and other content reactions so in

627
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,900
the diagram on the right a is the start

628
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,380
profile and B C D E and F are A's first

629
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,059
immediate first level friends of

630
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,120
interest and their friends are A's

631
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,440
secondary level friends and their

632
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,140
friends in Turner Ace tertiary contacts

633
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,299
an example of how such analysis can

634
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,400
assist in illicit trade research is this

635
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,740
so Janet doe lives in New York and runs

636
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,720
a shop which has Greek and Roman

637
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,480
Antiquities for sale it's suspected that

638
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,580
she may have links with dealers and

639
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,500
others who are facilitating the sourcing

640
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,840
and transport of stolen Antiquities

641
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,460
her Facebook settings have been

642
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,960
configured to prevent her non-friends

643
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,940
from viewing her friends list a search

644
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,620
of her name produces a list of 30

645
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,020
Facebook names who have made comments on

646
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,360
her Facebook profile a further search of

647
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,679
these comments reveals that there is a

648
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,720
user Jerry green based in Munich who

649
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,760
owns a freight and storage company

650
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,220
a search of Jerry shows that he has many

651
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,900
Facebook connections to people who work

652
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,299
or live near archaeological sites in

653
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,520
turkey and one of these contacts has

654
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,559
videos and images of using and selling

655
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,419
metal detecting equipment and another

656
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,940
contact here is advertised unclean coins

657
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,980
for sale so by tracking the chain of

658
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,720
contacts it may be possible to surmise

659
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,000
how and where Janet doe is obtaining the

660
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,799
Antiquities for her store

661
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,539
so we've developed a Facebook profile

662
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,400
Intel tool to automate this analysis

663
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,380
this scrapes the Facebook profile to

664
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,240
show and at a glance view of a profile's

665
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
contacts and their contacts in turn and

666
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,620
their interests and likes and so on and

667
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,299
keyword searches can also be done on

668
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,059
scrape data it works entirely within the

669
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,640
context of your Facebook credentials and

670
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,960
in this respect you'll only be able to

671
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
view the same details as if you logged

672
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,460
on to Facebook in the normal way

673
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,659
um so you wouldn't be able to see

674
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,100
personas friends if you couldn't

675
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,140
normally do this um in the context of

676
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,419
your account so at present this this

677
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,000
tool whilst it works uh runs far too

678
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,620
slow and some so some further

679
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,960
development work is needed and when it

680
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,520
works other enhancements will also be

681
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,679
added such as automatic language

682
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,320
translation quantifying how many times a

683
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,480
particular profile has been added as a

684
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,520
friend image recognition and contact

685
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
location mapping

686
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,400
search engine backlinks are often a

687
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,960
useful way of generating leads and

688
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,419
investigating breaches so backlinks are

689
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,100
inbound links to a website which get

690
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,559
which get added to a site's search

691
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,480
engine ranking and there are a number of

692
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,640
sites which record these backlinks so

693
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,260
the higher the number of backlinks the

694
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,240
more votes the site has which pushes it

695
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,760
up the rankings they're also useful for

696
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,159
showing old and current links to a site

697
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
along with relevant dates and times so

698
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,240
this example shows some backlinks to the

699
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,740
anon.com Anon files.com site and this

700
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,600
site is often used as a repository for

701
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,539
leaks malware and other nefarious files

702
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,880
and this is a screenshot of one

703
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,620
particular link found which offered a

704
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,960
file of leaked emails and passwords for

705
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,140
download

706
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,960
these examples Show links to a carding

707
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,360
site and a dark net hacking service site

708
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,860
all found through backlinks

709
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
publicly available lists of account

710
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
leaks are useful when trying to

711
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,980
ascertain more about a person or an

712
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,260
identity passwords often represent

713
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,520
something which has a strong personal

714
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,679
significance such as family member's

715
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,960
name a favorite sports team hobby or

716
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,240
meaningful data or location in some

717
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,820
leaked repositories it's possible to

718
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,320
search under many different criteria

719
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,480
even when the data the known data is

720
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,880
sparse so for instance a search can be

721
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,640
done on just a phone number a surname an

722
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,580
email address username and IP address

723
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,200
such repositories also allow lead

724
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,940
generation of searches of potential

725
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,700
suspects in criminal matters so in this

726
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,260
example the account list revealed

727
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,539
hundreds of users globally who had

728
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:35,279
chosen passwords which pointed to a very

729
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,900
high likelihood of their involvement in

730
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,820
specific crimes such as terrorism drug

731
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,139
dealing and child pornography

732
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,580
recently I conducted a study of

733
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,159
passwords uh felt a study of thousands

734
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:49,200
of leaked passwords and the gender of

735
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
those that they belong to those

736
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,039
passwords which contained special

737
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,080
characters belonged equally between the

738
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,179
genders but what was interesting is that

739
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,580
of these special characters placed in

740
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,140
the middle of a password so not at the

741
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,539
beginning or the end 26 of such

742
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,960
passwords belong to women and 74 to men

743
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
so even more noteworthy was that the

744
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,460
special characters used only by only

745
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,380
used by the women in this sample were

746
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,900
the at symbol the hash and percentage

747
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,659
signs and only the men chose the

748
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,760
underscore the dollar and question mark

749
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,960
symbols

750
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,400
there were even more definite

751
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,500
differences between the genders on their

752
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,600
choice of password so women were over

753
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,100
three times more likely to use their

754
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,900
first name and their password than men

755
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,120
but men were over twice as likely to use

756
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,580
their surname in their passwords men

757
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,860
were also almost four times more likely

758
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,200
to use their first name and surname in

759
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,539
the same password than women are nearly

760
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:44,100
twice as likely to use their email

761
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,559
account domain name in their password

762
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,779
perhaps the most interesting uh find of

763
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:51,360
all though is the use of the first names

764
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,640
in passwords so I looked at whether the

765
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,620
gender of the password owner affected

766
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,200
the choice of first name used males were

767
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,440
1.39 times more likely to choose a

768
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,240
female name as opposed to a male name

769
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,520
and out of the females choosing first

770
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,799
names they were over twice as likely to

771
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,799
choose a male name so what we have here

772
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,840
what we have here is that men are more

773
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,159
likely to choose a female name and

774
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,419
females are more likely to choose a male

775
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:17,760
name for their password so could this be

776
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,679
why ships and other forms of Transport

777
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,360
like cars are traditionally given female

778
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,340
names is this because the ship's

779
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,559
engineers and owners were mostly men so

780
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,059
standard theory on this is that ships

781
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,500
are usually given female names because

782
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,480
it symbolizes the product protective

783
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,580
goddess or the mother with its womb-like

784
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,159
container vessel I would propose that

785
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,480
the more likely reason is that the

786
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,399
ship's owners and designers were men who

787
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,620
naturally thought of a female name as a

788
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,659
ship like a car or a password is

789
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,779
essentially an inanimate object nothing

790
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,419
more complicated than this likewise if

791
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,279
the ship's owners and Engineers be

792
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,840
mostly women in the past we might have

793
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,039
seen more male name ships

794
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,860
public records are useful investigations

795
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,260
to link common entities and to build a

796
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,480
picture of any corporate relationships

797
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,700
so two apparently separate business

798
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,260
entities may be shown to be linked

799
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,720
through common domain contact names and

800
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,360
web service providers looking at domain

801
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,220
registration records on local Registries

802
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,080
can sometimes reveal the administrative

803
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
and Technical contact data as opposed to

804
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,179
the others which remove this data due to

805
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,940
privacy regulations so in this example

806
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,220
we can see the contact address addresses

807
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,080
of this particular website based in the

808
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,360
United Arab Emirates by looking at this

809
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,179
UAE based domain search site

810
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,460
company records will sometimes contain

811
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,860
useful information about a suspect even

812
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,600
when they have been altered

813
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,399
um when they when the suspects exalted

814
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,960
some of their personal details on the

815
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,480
official records to avoid detection so

816
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,919
regarding the official UK company

817
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,380
records an online search of a director

818
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,820
will show their month and year of birth

819
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,039
but on some official company documents

820
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,980
usually scans of paper records such as

821
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,500
change of director detail records the

822
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,000
full date of birth can be seen so it's

823
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,159
always worth checking the uploaded

824
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,720
company filing documents rather than

825
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,760
just the on-screen records some

826
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,260
directors have also been seen to

827
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,240
deliberately misspell their name or swap

828
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,799
their first and middle names to avoid

829
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,158
detection

830
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,880
open source data can also be obtained

831
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,919
from exposed network devices owned by

832
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,740
both companies uh or private users and

833
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,120
this gives a little bit on what we can

834
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,559
see with little technical skill

835
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,799
necessary so this 4G iot necrom device

836
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,960
login screen was accessed over a browser

837
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,240
and it wasn't necessary to log in to see

838
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,360
the status details which so the IMEI the

839
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,918
MZ firmware and other information

840
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,559
and this nebra hotspot crypto Miner

841
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,659
device was accessible over this specific

842
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,720
port and showed the device's version Mac

843
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,520
address helium Miner address and

844
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,679
frequency the other example on the right

845
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,240
shows the file is accessible over

846
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,720
Anonymous FTP access on Port 21 on a

847
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,480
Samsung DVR device so for legal purposes

848
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
Anonymous system access is considered

849
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,039
within the bounds of Open Source and

850
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,600
this has been verified with legal

851
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,740
experts on Cyber Law

852
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,779
with suspected IP addresses it's

853
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:14,580
sometimes useful to look at the open

854
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,140
ports not just on the addressing

855
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,960
question but on the other addresses

856
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,120
belonging to the same ISP and within the

857
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,620
same range as they may belong to the

858
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,960
same threat actor so in this example the

859
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,520
vulnerability exploitation tool

860
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,080
Metasploit was found to be running on

861
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Port 3790 on the suspect address and

862
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,059
then other addresses in this range was

863
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,700
searched to see if this port was open on

864
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,500
them which led to another address which

865
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,820
was found to have various hacking

866
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,220
software accessible on Port 80.

867
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,419
torrent peer connections can show IP

868
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,279
address and Country location and this is

869
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,659
quite useful for looking at those

870
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,179
seeding or leaching data leaks as well

871
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,320
as pirated content

872
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,620
the S by server map shows users who have

873
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,240
registered their software-defined radios

874
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,340
as servers on this site and shows which

875
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,020
are live their location and other

876
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,940
details like the operating system the

877
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,740
type of device in use

878
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,320
IP address and username and you can get

879
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,059
the location coordinates of a particular

880
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,580
SDR server and it's then possible to

881
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,620
Target surrounding radio frequency

882
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,620
transmitters including Wi-Fi hotspots by

883
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,960
using the advertised SDR server to scan

884
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
for signals in their locality this is

885
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,980
still within the bounds of Open Source

886
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,260
as the SDR server is in this case is

887
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,120
meant to be accessed by the public

888
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,120
other useful RF sites include open sub

889
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,460
ID in order to see the location and

890
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,559
details of cell towers and the helium

891
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,600
Explorer map which shows the location of

892
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,279
all the active helium cryptocurrency

893
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:47,059
mining devices

894
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,980
if you suspect a particular device of

895
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,260
Interest either because of its owner or

896
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,940
geographical location it's possible to

897
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,860
find out more about the device model if

898
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,640
it's an iPhone and has the fine find my

899
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,860
iPhone service enabled and you know the

900
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,840
user's iCloud credentials because one

901
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,460
can skip the two-factor authentication

902
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,500
in order to use the app by a browser

903
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,179
obviously this is a feature which is

904
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,460
there by Design as it allows users who

905
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,679
have lost their phone to find it and

906
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,659
they only need to log into iCloud to do

907
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,520
this and clearly this is something that

908
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,139
only those with the authority to use

909
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,480
those credentials should do so knowing

910
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,339
the use that the user here has an iPhone

911
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,440
12 we can assume that Ultra wide band

912
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,599
may be in use and this information may

913
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,980
be useful if conducting further

914
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,859
Assessments in the locality so Ultra

915
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,599
wide band applications for phones

916
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,520
include the Apple car key media file

917
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,639
transfers and connections with home iot

918
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,179
devices

919
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,960
so this app we created

920
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,540
um it extracts IP addresses from

921
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,379
forensic artifacts

922
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,780
yeah

923
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,940
um such as log files and flags if any

924
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,980
belong to one of the pre uh sorry

925
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,560
popular free VPN services that do not

926
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,839
require a credit card sign up

927
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,820
the assumption is that those who are

928
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,800
seeking to conduct nefarious activities

929
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,560
would be more likely to use services

930
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,880
without needing a credit card for

931
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,640
greater anonymity so this app highlights

932
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,380
potentially suspicious Source IP

933
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,480
addresses you just need to upload the

934
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,440
log or paste the file text and the app

935
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,540
extracts all the IP addresses and cross

936
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,119
matches it with the Rangers belonging to

937
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,400
those VPN Services which currently do

938
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,560
not require a credit card to sign up for

939
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm now going to show you some examples

940
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,060
of putting all this into action with

941
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,400
some recent actual cases starting with

942
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,980
this particular Dark Net uh malware hack

943
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,140
tool supplier so cross matching the

944
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,880
username found on Alpha Bay with data

945
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,320
and password leaks we find a password

946
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,640
containing uh 1731 we also search for

947
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
this username being used as a password

948
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,660
and this leads to finding a reference to

949
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,420
another password containing the number

950
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,400
1731 and an email address

951
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,680
the password appeared to contain a first

952
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,140
name other email addresses are also

953
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,660
found being associated with the 1731

954
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,839
password as well as two IP addresses for

955
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,240
this user and a phone number all based

956
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,700
in Algeria a Google search was done for

957
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,619
this phone number and first name and we

958
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,660
find this person and his Associated

959
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,799
physical address

960
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,320
this case involved hunting a threat

961
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,140
actor who had breached a large Telco we

962
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,359
had only a username to go on so starting

963
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,160
with a Google search of this name we

964
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,000
found a slight variant of it and

965
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,640
which led them to this tree of savior's

966
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,579
sight and showed a photo of uh of a user

967
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,520
his Brazil country location and a

968
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,920
Facebook profile link so the profile

969
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,440
name switched out the profile name

970
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,300
switched out letters for numbers in this

971
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,579
in a similar manner to the username so

972
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,500
we just swap the letters back to get a

973
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,020
use a surname a search on the password

974
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,780
leak list showed some passwords and a

975
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,220
Hotmail address

976
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,680
and then using the forgot password

977
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,900
function on Google for this address we

978
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,300
found two phone devices associated with

979
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,839
this account and on iCloud and one of

980
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,880
these devices ended in the phone number

981
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,820
77.

982
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,420
foreign

983
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,540
equivalent of John along with this other

984
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,640
information led to a reference where a

985
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,160
user by these details Arsenal forum for

986
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,020
a crack version of some gaming software

987
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,000
and also led to an account on the

988
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,099
hacking Forum nulled although the

989
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,859
previous Facebook profile had been

990
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,040
deleted it's still possible to locate it

991
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,599
was still possible to locate his Skype

992
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,520
and Instagram profiles where there were

993
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,500
lots of photos of him the Instagram

994
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,320
profile revealed his birthday his

995
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,020
probable work employer and his hometown

996
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,480
in Brazil and this also cooperated with

997
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,040
the IP addresses found in the password

998
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,820
leakless

999
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,680
lastly this involves searching for the

1000
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,300
identity of someone offering Red List

1001
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,940
prohibited Wildlife for sale such as

1002
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,740
cheetah and lion cubs in various

1003
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,839
countries the adverts contained a

1004
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,280
contact form and after we made this

1005
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,500
initial contact we engaged in some email

1006
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,720
dialogue which got us an email address

1007
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,940
and phone number a search for this

1008
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,560
number was made on WhatsApp and

1009
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,420
sometimes WhatsApp is useful for

1010
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,240
revealing mottos and profile pictures is

1011
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,680
that it's possible to look for someone

1012
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,920
look someone up on WhatsApp using the

1013
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,900
add a contact process without this

1014
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,119
person knowing you have done this so on

1015
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,980
this occasion WhatsApp didn't provide

1016
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,320
any information but Skype and Gmail gave

1017
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,180
us a username and a partial Gmail

1018
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,520
addresses so using a bit of guesswork

1019
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,020
with one of the redactive Gmail

1020
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,119
addresses we found a person's name

1021
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,400
business email company names country

1022
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,220
locate and Country location

1023
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,680
um further password email address and

1024
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,780
names cross matching on the password

1025
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,359
league list brought up more leads which

1026
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,339
led to this export company based in

1027
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,320
South Africa which I believe was being

1028
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,359
used to facilitate the export of illicit

1029
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:08,520
products such as Pharmaceuticals as well

1030
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,240
as wildlife

1031
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,920
so to conclude I hope this helps with

1032
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,200
locating the source and identity of

1033
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,180
cyber breaches and criminal suspects

1034
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,339
cyber Security Consultants are usually

1035
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,900
more successful with answering the

1036
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
question of what an attacker did and how

1037
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,339
they did it and when but really who has

1038
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,260
done something though many thanks for

1039
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,980
listening um I hope that was useful

1040
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,099
thank you
