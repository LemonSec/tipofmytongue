1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,120
again

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,000
I am Heather and I have Jared with me

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,740
will introduce ourselves in a second as

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,500
our fake personas actually we are going

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,560
to be talking building a pattern of life

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,760
um we were talking about this last night

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,340
the speaker event it's a topic that

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,500
changes so quickly and is extremely

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,039
relevant so you are going to be seeing

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,220
primarily iOS 14 and 15. so keep that in

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,100
mind next year maybe you'll see 16.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,700
as I said I'm Heather I am the senior

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,320
director of digital intelligence at

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,480
celebrate I'm also the Sans deeper

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,020
curriculum lead and faculty fellow

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,899
I represent Holly Michaels so that's my

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,820
picture up there looking very similar to

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,460
myself so that's my character for this

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,699
scenario that we built together and as

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,379
you can see on there I like nice wine

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:00:59,879
and bourbon if you're around me last

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,160
night I also like tequila and vodka and

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,539
all the things

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,600
day of regrets

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,960
and I am Jared Barnhart I'm a digital

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
intelligence specialist with celebrate

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,280
now uh but previously I did 10 and a

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
half years in law enforcement so I have

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,760
a sort of the investigative experience

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,280
from from that side uh to offer to some

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,500
of these scenarios I also love Bourbon

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,780
and in our scenario that we set up my

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,759
name is Joey Blanton planted after the

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,400
Bourbons so if anybody sees me later at

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,320
the bar Blanton's bourbon is uh is a

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,619
good thing but I hope I hope this talk

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,200
will sort of Point some of you to some

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,960
of the ideas to drive investigations or

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,340
data points that you can go search for

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,380
try to establish what someone was up to

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,820
at a certain time and place and things

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,840
like that

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,659
and we chose our names I have to clarify

45
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,100
this just in case anyone Googles Holly

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,140
Michaels not recommended

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,000
um the Australians told me who she

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
really is we chose our initials and then

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,020
went with names so don't on your work

50
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,579
computer look up Holly Michaels because

51
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,020
the first kid is not going to be

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,140
possibly who you just saw

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,780
all right for our scenario

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,818
locations and pattern of Life what we

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,619
wanted to do was

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,840
individual activity you'll see a lot of

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,060
my stuff was when I traveled worldwide I

58
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,340
had an opportunity to go to Australia to

59
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,540
go to Israel to do lots of things to

60
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,920
test what the data looks like in

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,420
different time zones what the tools are

62
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,700
parsing what they're not but we also

63
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,459
wanted to show can you tell when two

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,200
people are at the same place at the same

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,780
time and activities that were occurring

66
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,300
so were we in a vehicle at the same time

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
how many steps were we taking is there

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,860
any Health Data associated with it can

69
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,160
you put us at specific locations and

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,620
that's how we'll end this talk is a day

71
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,540
in the life essentially of two people

72
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,459
and what it looks like and Jared

73
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,440
colorized it very nicely between pink

74
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,060
and red and you'll get to see Holly

75
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,000
versus Joey and what it looks like the

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,760
artifacts are everywhere we have found

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,800
that a lot of stuff changed in iOS 14

78
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,140
and 15 compared to talks that we've done

79
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,340
in the past

80
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,379
um when I get to help Sarah and I did a

81
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,300
health presentation D for fitter bust a

82
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,700
few years ago and and

83
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,760
from there I took some of that stuff but

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,980
also things changed so you have to

85
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,480
really stay up to speed with anything

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,760
that's changing with these iOS version

87
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,239
updates

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,860
all right so the way this is going to go

89
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,780
is going to sort of do an overview of

90
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,640
some of the files and so all of this is

91
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,500
IOS so hold the audience who are my iOS

92
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,180
iPhone users

93
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,080
very proud but Jess okay

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,480
Sarah was your handout okay

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,920
and then the others you raise your hands

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,459
so that Jess is is AVID for both

97
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,620
um yeah so this is of course going to

98
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,480
focus on iOS so just uh stick with us

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,980
for the Android users but again if

100
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,900
you're in any any type of role whether

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,140
it be you know using MDM to access

102
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,599
devices on the corporate side or for law

103
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,580
enforcement or investigations

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,620
um these files are all iOS files and

105
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,700
we're just going to talk through some of

106
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,480
them

107
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,980
um towards the end then we'll build the

108
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,180
scenario and sort of bring it all

109
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,379
together for you

110
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,760
so the first file that I want to talk

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,798
about here today is cached.sqlite file

112
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,899
it's sort of like the golden file for

113
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,779
iOS for all location things so

114
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,639
essentially As you move as you drive as

115
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,300
you do anything the cache.sqlite file is

116
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,940
interacting with the API with apple and

117
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,620
basically pulling in all of your

118
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,840
locations so all the applications that

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,220
you install that ask for a permission

120
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,860
hey can I have your location once while

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,780
using depending on the type of

122
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,460
application that it is will determine

123
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,259
what level of accuracy the location it

124
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,020
can record right so as the applications

125
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,180
and the native Services need to know

126
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,919
where the device is it's being recorded

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,840
in this cache file it's about a rolling

128
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,660
seven days of data so if you need to

129
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,340
access this you have to get it pretty

130
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,720
quickly

131
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,880
but it's essentially breadcrumbs

132
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,919
especially if you're using GPS or

133
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,020
something like that to walk you from one

134
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,940
point to the next and some of the

135
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,139
examples that we'll show you'll see when

136
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,400
it's awesome and then when it's not so

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
great

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
um but generally this is a very reliable

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
file it's been around for years uh

140
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
hopefully it remains as we move forward

141
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,620
into 16 which I don't think we'll have a

142
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,160
problem but let me try to show some of

143
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,320
the pieces of this

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
so what we did here is basically I I

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
took uh the cache to sqlite file went in

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,500
and grabbed out

147
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,639
um

148
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,039
it wrote ran a query to grab out some of

149
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,479
the data points and then basically just

150
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,120
pressed play on those data points in a

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,699
Google Earth sort of animation

152
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,340
so as this runs basically just grabbed a

153
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,620
period of time and queried out the

154
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,660
results from this file and we talked

155
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,639
about this file very consistently but to

156
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,259
just watch it play so here's basically

157
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,600
me at home and you'll see that the

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
screen sort of jump around a bit and

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,020
then you'll see when I leave and turn on

160
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,120
GPS navigation so as it jumps around a

161
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,560
little bit it's all over the place not

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,880
super helpful there's not a lot of

163
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,259
accuracy to these data points they're

164
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,620
sporadic and then it goes okay

165
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,960
so as you dig into a to this file and

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,639
you need it for something in in your

167
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,020
environment you can see here where I

168
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,880
turned down this alley and stop come

169
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,919
back out these sort of pauses are

170
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,900
basically me stopping at red lights

171
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,400
um you can see me pull over to the side

172
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,660
of the road at a certain point if you

173
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,699
zoom in okay

174
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,220
and then I go for a drive

175
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,840
all right jump on the interstate and go

176
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,639
for a drive and if

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,919
this hurts your eyes I'm sorry but it

178
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,919
gets us to a place okay so this is just

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
using the cache.sqlite file grabbing a

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,240
specific point in time and saying where

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,860
was this device

182
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
okay and as I get closer to the

183
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,819
destination you'll see where I slow down

184
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,699
at traffic lights get off the ramp

185
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,400
stop with some others

186
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,220
and eventually arrive at a destination

187
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,500
okay it doesn't really get any better

188
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,380
than this for location right super

189
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,580
useful

190
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,639
we're going to Pivot from this place to

191
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,620
some other things but the next file that

192
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,580
I want to talk about on this location

193
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,340
piece is local.sqlite again a native

194
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,139
file that's been around for

195
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,020
numerous versions of iOS now and and is

196
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,940
remaining consistent you can see here at

197
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,280
the bottom it says 1451 compared to iOS

198
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,780
15.

199
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,319
so in your settings on iOS before 15 you

200
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,060
could go in and you could see all of the

201
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,380
significant locations you could touch

202
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,720
them you could see when you were there

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,520
how many times you've been there all

204
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,199
sorts of things just manually looking at

205
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,340
the device

206
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,560
When It upgraded to iOS 15 you can see

207
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
that it it still shows that there are

208
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,740
records there but it's not displaying

209
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,479
them visibly for you anymore all right

210
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
you will see recents and uh I looked at

211
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,180
mine this morning and it had a

212
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,620
Chick-fil-A that I went to two days ago

213
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,139
in my recents so at some point if it

214
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,240
determines that that recent place was

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,919
significant it will kick over to the

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,020
actual significant record or it might

217
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,699
just Purge if it determines that I was

218
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,740
only there for four minutes so maybe

219
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,900
it's not significant right

220
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,780
but local.sqlite is essentially

221
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,979
recording all of the stuff that you see

222
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,979
there on the left on the 14.5.1 example

223
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,979
of how many times I've been at a place

224
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,860
in a period of Time how long I was there

225
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
and some of the analytics that they're

226
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,860
providing are saying that I arrived at

227
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,860
this place via a 52 minute drive

228
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,319
whatever it might be okay

229
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,960
so again we have local.sqlite that's

230
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,580
sort of that constant moving location

231
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,840
record

232
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,440
local or cash flow sqlite doing that

233
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,340
local.sqlite reporting the things that

234
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,598
it determines are significant

235
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,979
and when you query these things out and

236
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,080
I just threw some up onto a map I can

237
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,299
confidently say that I absolutely was at

238
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,039
each of the points on this map okay so

239
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,720
my significant locations are places that

240
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
I definitely was at with my device and

241
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,640
we get entry and exit times uh to the

242
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,500
data that's recorded here also data

243
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,940
point count and then of course all the

244
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,339
coordinates

245
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,360
cloud or cloud-v2. sqlite for the newer

246
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,580
versions is also feeding into

247
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,399
significant locations data you can see

248
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,200
here that we have an expiration date so

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,420
think of the concept of

250
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,240
as you get into your car and it's tries

251
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
to start your navigation for you say are

252
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
you headed home and it wants to start

253
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,920
your Apple Maps or whatever to navigate

254
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,420
you there all right all these

255
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,820
convenience features that we as users

256
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,660
love

257
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,519
uh Apple's providing them for us but if

258
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,440
we dig in we can see all right there's a

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240
place that I go and maybe I go there

260
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,399
consistently every Monday morning but

261
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,720
there's a place that I go consistently

262
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,180
at some point if I stop going there that

263
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,920
place will expire it's no longer

264
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,959
significant to me so if you lived at one

265
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,459
place and then moved to another there

266
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:39,899
will be an overlap during that that

267
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,459
exchange where you'll have old places

268
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,140
that you're not currently going to then

269
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,459
they'll expire and you'll have a new set

270
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,060
in your list

271
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,300
so now we're going to Pivot from

272
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,100
location-based artifacts to more

273
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,080
granular movement stuff

274
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,779
so cache underscore encrypted C dot DB

275
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,420
and again there are other files that do

276
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,980
this stuff there's other health files

277
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,300
that we don't even cover in great detail

278
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,000
in this talk that also do this but I

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,920
wanted to point out uh cache encrypted C

280
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,140
because it's a really interesting

281
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,519
exchange from am I in a vehicle or not

282
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,980
and then counting steps so you can see I

283
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,420
wrote the query to be cute with the

284
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,459
little Emoji card to say I'm in a car or

285
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:18,839
I'm not

286
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,580
um but with the motion State history

287
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,339
table in this database it will tell me

288
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,820
if the phone is vehicular or not so is

289
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,519
it moving in a vehicle or isn't it if

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
you look at the bottom where it has 4 8

291
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,980
of 22 at 1604 where it switches from

292
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,779
vehicular to no

293
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,120
I can then look over to another table in

294
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,640
the same database step count history

295
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,620
and there you'll see that right after

296
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,540
that 1604 time I have what 1604.25 so it

297
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,360
starts to add steps so at the point

298
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,040
where I am no longer in a vehicle I can

299
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,660
then see me starting to take steps with

300
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,860
the device okay so this

301
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,300
this database has about 10 days worth of

302
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,180
data so again if if cash was there and

303
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,459
now has gone you might not have that

304
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,019
perfect location stuff but you could

305
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,940
potentially say that someone was in a

306
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,279
car up until a certain second minute

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
however granular you want to be and then

308
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,660
started taking steps you could then

309
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,920
transition into some of the other health

310
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,920
artifacts to say okay how many steps but

311
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,779
then also here we have ascending and

312
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,000
descending floors so for me I live in a

313
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,339
townhouse literally every time I ever go

314
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,019
drive my car I descend a flight of

315
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,360
stairs the last thing I do and I I would

316
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,120
see the descends tick up as then I went

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,100
to vehicular and started driving so

318
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,079
really neat file

319
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,700
um offering some of that

320
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,220
uh movement artifact stuff and then I'll

321
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,279
pass to that thank you all right so for

322
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,620
health I'm going to cover this is all

323
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,060
location-based so I tried to

324
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,880
specifically focus on the locations but

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,500
anything that is new and updated from

326
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,600
the deeper fitter bus that Sarah and I

327
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,519
did five years ago I guess that's how

328
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,500
long it's been

329
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,360
um also on health and I had a really

330
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,040
good question you're going to see where

331
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,079
it tracks steps or meters and Jared was

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,399
just saying that you can see how many

333
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,779
steps someone took

334
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,700
Josh Hickman has done a lot of research

335
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,440
and we were going to do Android Health

336
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,420
it's a giant nightmare so I would say

337
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,980
that's never going to happen as a talk

338
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,500
but we did do enough research enough to

339
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
be dangerous with it where it's hard to

340
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,240
tell and you may have to replicate some

341
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,440
things

342
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,380
um infamously dragging bodies I think

343
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,940
I'm Sarah and I were talking maybe I'll

344
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,399
drag her body to update that video so if

345
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,660
you were here five years ago and saw

346
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,820
that I dragged a body to try to

347
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,620
replicate a murder I actually hurt my

348
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,720
hamstring doing this I had to have a

349
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,459
neighbor all I had to do was text her

350
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,600
and say hey will you come over and

351
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
record me dragging a body and she said

352
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,760
sure after my call no questions asked so

353
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,160
she's a good neighbor to have that's a

354
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,779
good Karen to have in your life where

355
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,820
she's like yeah whatever you need huh

356
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,100
I'll record this so the first one we

357
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,720
want to look at is healthy bee secure

358
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,519
sqlite many of you have probably heard

359
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,880
of this the tools do a pretty good job

360
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,820
parsing it except when it comes to all

361
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,399
locations but something we found there

362
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,380
is a new well there are several new

363
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,880
workouts but one that I was using

364
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,980
because I am such a cheater when it

365
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,839
comes to competitions is called mind and

366
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,899
body so I was flying to Australia I did

367
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,940
a workout for like four hours on my

368
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,920
flight called Mind and Body because I

369
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,260
was resting my mind so I could beat Joey

370
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,940
in a health competition that we were in

371
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,339
so we started a help a competition for

372
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,899
seven days and she was gonna be on an

373
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,459
airplane for like two of those days and

374
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,839
she still beat me

375
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,880
mind and body because she did mind and

376
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,200
body and the best is we're looking at

377
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,519
these queries so we were using the

378
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,980
queries from Apollo and Jared said I

379
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,420
don't know what this one is I'm like oh

380
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,820
I bet it's mind and body because that's

381
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,200
what I was doing and it is you can see

382
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,880
mind and bodies in there

383
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,920
um indoor outdoor walk I walked a lot

384
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,620
inside of airports and that's something

385
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,180
I was hoping that you could decipher the

386
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,139
difference because putting someone

387
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,760
outside versus inside could be helpful

388
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,760
still can't do that but you can see hit

389
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,500
training and some other real things but

390
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,959
mine was mostly mind and body so just

391
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,820
validate your tools if you're using them

392
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,560
to rely upon it

393
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,899
another thing periods of activity versus

394
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,180
inactivity so if you look at this chart

395
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,820
and this is one screenshot from a tool

396
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,380
if you look at it you're like wow her

397
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,880
heart rate was really spiked what was

398
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,260
she doing because her energy level was

399
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,839
so low I was sleeping on an airplane I

400
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,300
was doing mind and body at this time and

401
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,339
if you look at it even though the graph

402
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,959
is making it look like it's really

403
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,540
exciting it's not I think my heart max

404
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,060
heart rate was at 99 maybe I got up and

405
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,040
walked to the restroom so even though it

406
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,260
was really resting energy this is a good

407
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,300
example of mind and body but this could

408
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,680
also be a good example if you think

409
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,860
someone was attacked or something like

410
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,959
maybe you're not exerting any energy

411
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,000
you're tied up and you're terrified and

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,920
your heart rate's like click on the

413
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
button and make sure you actually look

414
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,940
at the database and see how high those

415
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,800
heart rate spikes were

416
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,839
but to get to location

417
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,240
so here we are looking at metadata

418
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
values and also the data provenances and

419
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,500
what you're going to find is not

420
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,720
everything is going to be represented by

421
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,540
tools out there all the queries that are

422
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,399
in this on the final slide we created a

423
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,019
little Evernote that you can get every

424
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,720
query we ran for this presentation so

425
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,639
you can just copy and paste them but

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,380
something you're going to see is the

427
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,540
device and the time zone where I was so

428
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,940
you'll see a lot of American New York I

429
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,680
did stuff in Los Angeles and Australia

430
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,220
and those things were math however under

431
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,380
data provenances nothing seems to be

432
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,720
really parsing this correctly and there

433
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,820
were some time zones we were in Israel

434
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,220
for a work event and I remember when we

435
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,360
were out

436
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,000
we were in Asia Jerusalem but didn't it

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,860
hit like a cell tower for Istanbul or

438
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,120
something at one point I was like what

439
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,100
is that where are we right now are they

440
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,139
going to kill us in this desert we're in

441
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,519
the middle of nowhere

442
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,339
doing these dune buggy rides but none of

443
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,199
that stuff was actually parks

444
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,839
and I teach 585 I had a student last

445
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,980
week during the forensic challenge she's

446
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,899
like I want to put this location with

447
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,579
this device because Cloud sync was

448
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,500
enabled and they wanted to say who did

449
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,720
what a specific time it can be really

450
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,180
important but it's not a simple thing to

451
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,560
do with putting all the things together

452
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,199
so use the queries they are available to

453
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:10,920
you

454
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,839
if you're sharing Health Data so if you

455
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,880
have Fitness friends there's going to be

456
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
these contacts cash dot that files and

457
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
you should be able to see the name the

458
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,440
Apple ID who they're sharing with

459
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,820
um here you can see we threw this Proto

460
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,800
buff into cyber Chef just to replicate

461
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,240
this data for you and show you what it

462
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,579
looks like but it can be extremely

463
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,240
helpful you may also be able to track

464
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,279
locations where things occurred with

465
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,579
people

466
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,820
from data usage all right so Jared

467
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,259
talked about

468
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,839
the locations we have the help and now

469
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,100
we want to look at what's actually

470
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,320
happening on the device so you can say

471
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,699
that is the device where something

472
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,959
happened

473
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,660
um Sarah won how many years ago was your

474
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,180
knowledge C blog of the year two three

475
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,320
years ago

476
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,800
do you remember

477
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,540
the last in person right

478
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,280
three years ago maybe Sarah did

479
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,900
knowledge his power and she did a lot of

480
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,459
research on knowledge c

481
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,619
um Ian whiffen who is our co-worker is

482
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,720
going to release an entire paper he

483
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,640
believes on every single knowledge C

484
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
artifact and what it means and how it's

485
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,160
populated he is a wild man and I don't

486
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,859
think he sleeps ever so that hopefully

487
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,720
that comes out this year

488
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
but everything from how loud you listen

489
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,340
to your music the applications you use

490
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,380
battery usage what you're searching for

491
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,660
in Safari if you touch your device and

492
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,419
it powers on Powers off all of that is

493
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,880
track and knowledge C so it's crazy not

494
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,919
to mention it in this presentation

495
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,620
because obviously it matters a lot so

496
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,059
we're going to walk you through some

497
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,280
device artifacts at this point and then

498
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,559
we'll finish with a day in the life and

499
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,419
what it actually looks like

500
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,179
yeah so knowledge C itself could be like

501
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,460
a eight hour training session without

502
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,980
leaving that single file uh we're gonna

503
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,200
jump over to some Wi-Fi stuff so there's

504
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,720
two files here uh com apple Wi-Fi no

505
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
networks uh p-list and then recent

506
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,740
networks Json

507
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,419
um the one that I have shown to you here

508
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,419
is the uh the plist file and you can see

509
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,160
I sort of just grabbed out that that top

510
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,860
one that's the Fatal free and broke it

511
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,900
out so it expanded the P list so that

512
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
you can see some of the values the

513
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,900
reason that I like to mention this is

514
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,520
because it gives you three touch points

515
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,000
for a device's Wi-Fi connection so you

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,740
can see the one that says join by user

517
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,480
app so think of this as the point in

518
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,340
time where I actually manually deciding

519
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
to select the Wi-Fi network and connect

520
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,240
many of you probably did that in this

521
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,940
hotel here in the last 24 hours or so so

522
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,160
you're sort of creating that record then

523
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,080
you get a previously joined time all

524
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,179
right so another another time that you

525
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:46,860
have so not the first time you connected

526
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,840
but it previously joined and then joined

527
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,360
by system at so the first time I'm

528
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,280
manually doing it the next time I come

529
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,380
back uh assuming you don't have to deal

530
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,419
with like a login type page the system

531
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,740
is going to automatically connect you

532
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,600
back to that same Wi-Fi again so it's

533
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,340
saying you're here when you chose to

534
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,380
connect and then the system is

535
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,820
connecting for you this other time all

536
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,020
right so just a couple different time

537
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,520
date and time

538
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,559
um artifacts that you can probably

539
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,480
associate to a place especially if

540
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,820
you're in control of the network in the

541
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,500
building or something like that you can

542
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,120
very clearly say you're connecting to

543
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,280
this point uh over here on this side of

544
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,960
the building and that type of

545
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,600
investigation

546
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,299
um another file for Wi-Fi is the Wi-Fi

547
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,000
network store model.sqlite this file has

548
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,980
been around for again many iOS versions

549
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,840
and I just

550
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,100
present this to you with a bit of

551
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,460
caution so as you can see here my house

552
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,679
is the one with the lightning bolt on it

553
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,440
the orange lightning bolt and that

554
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,840
little dot is the mapped coordinate that

555
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,679
was recorded for that Wi-Fi connection

556
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,360
across the street at that other

557
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,059
townhouse is another dot for that same

558
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,600
network my lightning Network okay now if

559
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,919
you were deciding on where a crime

560
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,780
occurred you basically have two

561
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,179
different houses right my house is

562
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,559
actually stacked on top of another house

563
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,880
it's a townhouse that's the third and

564
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,919
fourth floor versus first and second so

565
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,900
this is really neat to get you close but

566
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,160
you would have to do some extra work to

567
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,200
be really sure of which door you're

568
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,179
allowed to enter if that's the scenario

569
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,919
okay but the coordinates are pretty good

570
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,600
and the date and time is the last

571
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,480
connection time for the device

572
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,299
interaction C for this one just sort of

573
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:25,440
pointing out

574
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,120
um some of the communication stuff gets

575
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,400
mapped in the interactionc.db file and

576
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,720
for this one it basically caught me

577
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
airdropping from my test phone to my

578
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,160
personal Mac to grab a file out so you

579
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,919
can see a a start and end time and then

580
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,539
it kicks over to the bundle that was

581
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,520
using it it's the slideshow

582
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,500
from the slideshow the target bundle ID

583
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,940
was a a UI activity airdrop

584
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,520
it was an outgoing and the recipient of

585
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,280
that was my MacBook Pro for the name of

586
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,919
my MacBook okay so again just an

587
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,900
interesting file just to cover it

588
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,760
quickly and move forward

589
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,000
all right so our scenario we tried to

590
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,179
meet at the same point and conduct as

591
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,039
many of these things together as

592
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,240
possible so you can see what it looks

593
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,980
like when two people who have separate

594
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,960
activity are together at the same

595
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,220
location

596
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,840
um the vice movement including just

597
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,240
walking descending stairs

598
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,100
um walking into a bar getting into

599
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,799
Vehicles doing a test drive

600
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,720
um posting things on social media even

601
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,140
the health the device usage all of the

602
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,940
complete picture finally in one place

603
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,159
from two different perspectives remember

604
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,200
Joey's going to be red and Holly's going

605
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,299
to be in pink

606
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,760
okay so yeah if you think of the

607
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,100
scenario as you're not just trying to

608
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,080
determine if someone did something but

609
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,000
you're trying to more uh pair together

610
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,340
if two different people did something

611
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,679
together uh so it's not just saying yes

612
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:53,820
I'm very comfortable about this one but

613
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,380
trying to Overlay the activities at

614
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,299
least a little bit and put two people at

615
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,039
the same place at the same time so this

616
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
is a representation of that cash.sqlite

617
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
file the query was written to basically

618
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,159
say I want to select all the things from

619
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,200
this point in time to this point in time

620
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,480
all right so it does look pretty that

621
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,280
they are at the same yeah they were at

622
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,780
the same place at the same time of

623
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,700
course it's test data but when you

624
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,559
select the exact same period of time

625
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,480
between two separate extractions or

626
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,460
pieces of data if it looks like this

627
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,260
it's pretty convincing that there's a

628
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,299
certainly overlap to where their

629
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,039
locations are and if you look go back

630
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,140
once if you look at Holly's data you see

631
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,820
how mine is a little bit jumped around

632
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,980
at that Top This was the first time

633
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,960
Holly's device connected to Jared's

634
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,059
Wi-Fi Jared's car so I feel like it was

635
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,280
trying to familiarize whereas Joey was

636
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,799
connected right several times yeah yeah

637
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,299
so up at the top there's a little bit of

638
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,820
I guess disparity to to her data points

639
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,440
compared to mine which were pretty solid

640
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
there at the top and the whole way

641
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,080
through

642
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,740
okay so going to dig into Cash encrypted

643
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,080
C from this period of time so you can

644
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,840
see at the top there we have that 17th

645
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
so I'm on the left with the red the 17

646
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,820
13 24 would start driving all right if

647
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,380
you look over at the pink

648
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,880
the top 17 13 20 also driving now are we

649
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,380
in the same car are we in separate cars

650
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,120
right there's still some variables here

651
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,500
that would need some a little bit more

652
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,520
information a little bit more

653
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,799
investigation right but basically this

654
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,299
file is saying both of these devices

655
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,299
went from not vehicular to vehicular

656
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,760
within seconds of each other all right

657
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,980
at the end of the bottom of those boxes

658
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
that I put around those you can see 17

659
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,480
15 14 is the last vehicular on the red

660
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
in 1715 18 is the last in the pink so

661
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,220
again within seconds of each other and

662
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,200
then they kick to not vehicular

663
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,880
when you

664
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,820
go from from vehicular to not then the

665
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,380
box at the bottom is okay now that

666
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,000
they're not vehicular are they taking

667
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,080
steps

668
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,120
and that's where where that picks up so

669
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,780
you can see the 17 15 50 per red and 17

670
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,280
15 49 for pink all right so a total of

671
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,140
maybe like eight or nine seconds total

672
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,059
between driving and step counts that

673
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,860
were basically the exact same like we

674
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,480
were doing the exact same activity

675
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,580
pulling this data from this same file

676
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,440
from two different devices it becomes

677
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
sort of clear

678
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,280
now

679
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,400
we're in a car together and where did we

680
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,380
go all right so I looked at the Joey

681
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,240
device and you can see that from 401 to

682
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
511 all right we went to this place and

683
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,780
it's the place that already showed you

684
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,419
in that drive from the cache.sqlite file

685
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,700
but then we left there and we went to

686
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,500
the next place and that's the the small

687
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,940
tiny piece that we're going to pull

688
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,179
apart here all right so after we left

689
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,039
Bright Meadow Drive where did we go next

690
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,539
and you can see in the bottom right

691
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,100
corner there where it says Kentlands

692
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,159
Market Square my significant locations

693
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,620
for my 14.5.1 device was already telling

694
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,659
me exactly where we went right so it's

695
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,640
just pulling that data out of there

696
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,100
so leaving that place and going to the

697
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,740
next again running a query against the

698
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,720
cache.sqlite file for the exact same

699
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,140
period of time using using uh the Mac

700
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,900
absolute Epoch right I can say here's

701
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,100
this device and here's the second one

702
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,020
and you can obviously see they're going

703
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,280
to the same place

704
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,220
we arrive and park at that spot that I

705
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,600
have marked parking space and an

706
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,700
interesting interestingly enough we walk

707
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,620
into that bar but you can see the

708
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,240
location Point sort of drop off a little

709
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,400
bit for the actual bar itself

710
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,440
right as we're driving and doing things

711
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,659
that require that sort of constant

712
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,299
refresh of location great stuff when we

713
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,159
walk in and just sit down we're now not

714
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,140
moving uh we're not asking for anything

715
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,179
for location essentially we have a data

716
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:32,760
point drop off which is normal

717
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,220
now that we're in the bar

718
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,500
um we're going to take a look at just

719
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,299
the Joey device and try to understand

720
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,400
now that we know exactly where he is

721
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,440
what happened next right

722
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,760
so now we're going to look at knowledge

723
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,980
C on the device what is happening and

724
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,659
again we're just picking apart tiny

725
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,880
little things that happened in these few

726
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,980
minutes of time

727
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,140
so here you can see that as I got into

728
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,700
the car before I started that short

729
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,980
drive that I just showed you I placed my

730
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,600
phone on the wireless charger in my car

731
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,299
devices plugged in okay so wireless

732
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,120
charging is displayed in the knowledge

733
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,279
database

734
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,140
the next thing that I did and it has a

735
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,940
nice little time stamp there at 17 14

736
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,080
16. I launched the camera so it says app

737
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,360
usage and then app and focus

738
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,279
and you can see there I can go find a

739
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,779
photo that matches up to the date and

740
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,700
time I open the camera on the device

741
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,080
when I arrived at the bar and took a

742
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,199
picture

743
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,080
the next thing that you see is

744
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,620
com.apple.preferences now this one's a

745
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,940
little tricky because it simply tells

746
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,559
you that I opened the settings on the on

747
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,900
the iPhone it's not perfectly clear

748
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,279
exactly what happened within the

749
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,539
settings and there's a million things

750
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,740
that could happen

751
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,559
the the preference files the PLS

752
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,320
associated with preferences is like

753
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,260
a full-time job for a person or two

754
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,000
all right but in this scenario I cheated

755
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,799
a little bit when I got into the bar I

756
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,559
opened and connected to Wi-Fi all right

757
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,419
when I connected to the Wi-Fi you can

758
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,059
see here uh the

759
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,039
actual Wi-Fi network that I connected to

760
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,659
from that known network speed list that

761
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,400
I showed you before so it gives you that

762
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,140
date and time that I as the user chose

763
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,679
to connect to that Wi-Fi right

764
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:12,380
the next thing that we have is

765
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,700
com.apple.mobile slideshow all right

766
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,980
we're in the photos we're looking at

767
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,659
pictures we're doing whatever and

768
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:20,340
essentially what was happening here is I

769
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,480
was

770
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,080
um

771
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
going to

772
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,220
take a photo and then post it to

773
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,480
Instagram that's what I was purposely

774
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,520
doing to generate data

775
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,860
which is what I did so you can see the

776
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,260
transition then from the bundle ID com

777
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,500
dot bourbon.instagram app usage app and

778
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,480
focus and out there is the Joey

779
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,059
Blanton's post to Instagram

780
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:44,658
now

781
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,460
that was a very quick overview of a lot

782
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,200
of things and again

783
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,059
if you wanted to dig into knowledge C

784
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:52,799
awesome I mean you could you could spend

785
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,240
a ton of time there and it'll tell you

786
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,340
so many things about any device that you

787
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,860
would want to know if your investigation

788
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,020
is location based hopefully you picked

789
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,480
out uh how awesome that cache.s sqlite

790
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,159
file can be if you can get it in the

791
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,720
time frame that it still retains data

792
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,659
all right but from what you're seeing

793
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,279
here on the screen we have 1711 to 1730.

794
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:17,039
so about 19 minutes of time looking

795
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,320
through one single file we're able to

796
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,760
say all of these different things about

797
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,279
that user's activity all right so as we

798
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,600
break that out a little bit you can

799
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,000
really get granular and be confident in

800
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,159
where someone was what they were up to

801
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,159
on the device their physical movements

802
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,600
and then when you get into the health

803
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,799
piece

804
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,080
it really can can tell you the world

805
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,360
about heart rate steps all those things

806
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,100
and again we've breezed over a lot of

807
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,779
the health stuff

808
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,580
um didn't get real granular with each

809
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,820
step and things like that also wearables

810
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,820
so on the Joey phone there was a Apple

811
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,380
watch that was Associated so the data

812
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,120
was more enriched than perhaps someone

813
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,179
that didn't have an app watch as well

814
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,220
if you take knowledge C out of the

815
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,400
equation so we get a lot of cases that

816
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,080
come into us at work saying hey this is

817
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,360
hard or the tools aren't doing this help

818
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,059
us do this without knowledge C it makes

819
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,580
it really really difficult and it's

820
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,320
interesting when that is stripped away

821
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,900
from you for how much we rely upon it

822
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,600
um sadly the tools that most people use

823
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,820
for mobile forensics do an okay job with

824
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,980
it but that okay job doesn't ultimately

825
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,440
timeline very well and put that entire

826
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,700
picture together and that's where it's

827
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,100
going to require more of you doing these

828
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,840
things and because of that what we did

829
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,600
was we created and this is My URL

830
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,080
shortener so at for585.com forward slash

831
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,779
D for Summit 22 and we can put that in

832
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,419
the slack channel of the hallway if you

833
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,520
go there every query that we talked

834
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,559
about for this specific presentation

835
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,600
will be there keep in mind it's only iOS

836
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,740
14 and 15. so as things change with 16

837
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,860
it'll be different if it goes back to

838
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,799
13. again we recommend and using this

839
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,980
using Apollo using eye leap these tools

840
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,039
will help you as well with it and we

841
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,899
didn't show Hollies

842
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,240
knowledge C breakdown and all of the day

843
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,279
because it was really similar but some

844
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,960
things that were interesting in hers

845
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,580
other than the fact that she Tick-Tock

846
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,340
the entire car ride was that I did

847
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,100
connect to Jared's car that his Wi-Fi

848
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,240
would have been a brand new connection

849
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,539
for me we both did connect in the bar I

850
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:25,740
think we tagged each other on Instagram

851
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,080
posts so you would see similar

852
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,240
artifacts that would put the two devices

853
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,940
together but if you only have one in

854
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,380
your investigation and you're lacking

855
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,720
the other it obviously could be a huge

856
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,779
missing part of the puzzle as well

857
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,580
we have this email address here so

858
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,980
locations it hits several of us

859
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,080
um who have done location research at

860
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,460
celebrite so if you have a location

861
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
question even if it's not celebrate

862
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,539
related we don't care if you're like hey

863
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,820
I found this file I don't I'm not even a

864
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,320
customer of yours you can email

865
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,840
locations at celebrite.com and it will

866
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
hit a team of us that will respond to

867
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,360
you and help you

868
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,080
