1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm Veronica Schmidt and the question

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,559
that I have for you today is do you see

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,719
it coming have you built in

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,940
observability no I don't need an answer

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,500
to that question yet but I want you to

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,060
ponder upon that as the talk continues

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,039
now who am I I'm an assistant professor

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,619
at North University in Norway I teach

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,660
medical device forensics as one of my

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,059
specialties but generally teaching in

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:34,500
the realm of digital forensics and

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,899
incident response I also work with an

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,600
amazing team at matronic in the United

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,239
States specifically the cardiac Rhythm

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,559
management team I am a cyborg and buy me

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,120
a coffee and I'll tell you that story

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,000
but I've been a dfir professional for

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,739
more than 10 years as well as a medical

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,379
device hacker and forensicate an

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,739
incident responder now I'm also a mom to

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,079
two little forensic ages and hackers and

23
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,860
I developed the five log philosophies

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,180
so let's get started why is medical

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,780
devices such a big thing why do we care

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,119
well recent statistics showed that in

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
the United States three to six Network

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,320
medical devices are next to each

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,320
patient's bed now if you do the sums in

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,479
that that is quite a lot of network

31
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,560
medical devices

32
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,020
now why do I care because for the last

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,119
five years I've been eating breathing

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,700
and living medical devices well I've had

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,920
one beating my heart since the age of

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,460
19. I am on device four I have had

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,920
failures rejections and therapy changes

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
ask me I've had them all in May I

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,799
recently had a full rewired device and

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,840
firmware update so now I'm proudly as

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,680
cyborg 2.0 so you might say that this is

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,540
very close to my heart and I've got skin

43
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,700
in the game

44
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,700
now I always have a saying with great

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,100
technology comes great responsibility to

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,500
protect it but if I ask you the question

47
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,199
do we have enough information to detect

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,120
whether or not a device has been

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,099
breached we've all seen the

50
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,680
vulnerabilities but the question remains

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,540
do we know whether they've been

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,940
exploited in the wild

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,040
now that's a very hard question for me

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,660
to answer because it physically it

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,340
depends on the device

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,220
but most likely not yet

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,879
we're not yet robustly and you know

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,800
actively looking for those threats on

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,780
medical devices

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,700
now I'm going to say to you all medical

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,280
devices aren't designed equal they're

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
not the same they might be classified as

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,440
a medical device but you know they're

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,060
not the same there's apples there's

65
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,420
pears and lemons they all differ

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,940
now according to the FDA as well as

67
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,860
European guidelines there are three

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,560
types of medical devices that are active

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
medical devices

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,739
um so these are generally your patient

71
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,860
monitors your MRI machine and devices

72
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,200
that aren't implanted in a human being

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,780
then you will get your sick you know

74
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,540
your category of active implanted

75
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,239
medical devices now those my to be

76
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,360
devices such as diabetes monitors

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,819
um deep brain stimulators

78
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:21,620
um

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,500
gastrointestinal stimulators as well as

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,819
cardiac implants

81
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,120
so kind of these two are very different

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,640
in what they do and what Hardware

83
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,700
software and operating systems they run

84
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,980
lastly you get your diagnostic medical

85
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,040
devices and yes you might not believe it

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,480
but in vitro swabs

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,519
and specimen examination trays are

88
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,180
considered to be a medical device for

89
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,620
the purpose of this talk we will be

90
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,200
focusing on the first two and not the

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,299
last one this was kind of just some

92
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,280
background to understand

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,980
what kind of medical devices are out

94
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,360
there

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,940
now these are further than classified

96
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,360
according to the FDA in terms of high

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,180
risk and low risk so high risk is more

98
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,340
those that are implanted in the body but

99
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,220
which are life-sustaining

100
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,320
um and this is kind of the process that

101
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,100
goes through the FDA when it gets to

102
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,720
um

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,460
approvals and these approvals might

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,520
differ based be different based upon the

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,340
geographical regions the US is different

106
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,100
from Australia New Zealand and the EU

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,400
region and the UK so it kind of depends

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
on the region you are doing the

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,380
geophorensics in

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,540
now let's simplify it a little bit

111
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,479
because those according to me can get a

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,479
little bit convoluted and confusing

113
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,900
we have an implant that implant has a

114
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,280
programmer

115
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,220
that programmer has an application on it

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,380
it has an operating system and it

117
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,240
contains Hardware

118
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,580
so the only one that is perhaps a little

119
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,380
bit strange is the implants in the

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,240
programmer but in digital forensics we

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,699
know all about applications we know

122
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,100
about different operating systems and we

123
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,100
understand hard way so three out of the

124
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,199
five medical components that we might

125
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,720
encounter we actually do understand as

126
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,900
digital forensic practitioners

127
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,000
now let's break it down a little bit

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,660
more now your implants will often have

129
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,380
an embedded Os or have no OS at all and

130
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,479
it's more in terms of what we would

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,600
encounter during memory forensics

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,180
um a set of memory addresses that runs

133
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,800
on low energy

134
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,080
so if you break a dance and simplify

135
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,360
things you understand that these devices

136
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,919
are

137
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,220
as smart as they are clinically hardware

138
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,039
and

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,500
Hardware level as well as what

140
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,960
information it contains is perhaps a

141
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,340
little bit dumber than what we're used

142
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,580
to now the programmer often runs Windows

143
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,160
Linux Android or another in you know

144
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,039
embedded operating system I've

145
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,620
encountered them on all of these and

146
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,720
they range from Windows XP throughout

147
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,960
Windows 95 to Windows 10 kiosk as well

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,660
as running Android or various variants

149
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,360
of Linux now again

150
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,580
this might seem like it is

151
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,440
oversimplified but I promise you when

152
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,180
you start opening these devices and

153
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,280
start you know getting to know them that

154
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,319
it's things we've encountered just in a

155
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,780
different format now the applications

156
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,639
that connect to these programmers and

157
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,380
allow the communication between the

158
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,840
implant and the programmer often is a

159
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,639
mobile application or one that's a

160
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,919
desktop or even tablet based

161
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,960
now there's a huge variety because it

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,720
depends on the use cases it depends on

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
the manufacturer and it depends on the

164
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
geographical area

165
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,600
now operating systems you might find

166
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,139
embedded such as VX Works iOS Windows

167
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,020
and Android so if you've been around in

168
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,940
digital forensics for more than let's

169
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,400
say a decade just you know get ready to

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,919
brush off those uh Windows 95 and

171
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,100
Windows XP skills now the hardware is a

172
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,720
little bit complicated because that

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,620
really depends on each manufacturer and

174
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,300
that kind of you have to have the device

175
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,759
in your hand so it's not as easy just to

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,039
simplify that up but the rest of the

177
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,699
components all contain logs

178
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,460
now on the vulnerable side of things we

179
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,500
need to become comfortable with the fact

180
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,919
that at some point a medical device will

181
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,680
be vulnerable in its lifetime and

182
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,199
there's various reasons for that

183
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,419
now some of the things you might find is

184
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,380
IV pumps that have you know contain 38

185
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,560
of the typical footprint in a hospital

186
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,080
however in the latest years they have

187
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,440
had 73 of the vulnerabilities that have

188
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,500
been disclosed now these are various

189
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,780
vulnerabilities from high risk to

190
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,819
low-risk but they make up a large

191
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,460
proportion and that could typically be

192
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,680
because they are so important within the

193
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,500
hospital ecosystem

194
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,759
now you get something which is called

195
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,800
Capital Equipment which is equipment and

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
hospitals lease this is your MRI

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,960
machines and your very expensive medical

198
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,020
devices your program is that program the

199
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,000
implants are often also Capital

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,419
Equipment now these can run Windows 10

201
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,260
or they might only run Windows XP and

202
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,419
the reason being is that they are around

203
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,539
for 10 plus years and the hardware

204
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,299
simply doesn't support this OS to be

205
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,580
updated

206
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,760
Now default passwords remain a problem

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,100
in this space it's one that we encounter

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,519
often in the logs I might add they might

209
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,680
be Basics before encrypted and they

210
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,560
might be just logged in clear text

211
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,220
as I said before these devices

212
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,260
are made to last for many years

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,339
I kind of realized with every

214
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,220
vulnerability that all roads lead to the

215
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,420
logs

216
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,260
but as much as the logs is for good as

217
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,600
we use them in digital forensics they

218
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,880
are the double-edged lightsaber of the

219
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,279
world when it comes to medical devices

220
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,620
because as much as we want all the

221
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,480
information to be logged so does

222
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,519
attackers because if you have physical

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,459
access to a medical device you could

224
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:35,040
potentially have the keys to the kingdom

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,800
Just One log

226
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,279
away

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,320
so let's talk a little bit about what I

228
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,940
mean from the log side of things from a

229
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,860
medical device manufacturer perspective

230
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,860
and don't think corporate don't at all

231
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,620
think corporate think product logs now

232
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,959
when I say product logs I refer to those

233
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,019
that are contained on the application as

234
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,899
well as on the devices themselves so

235
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,940
it's not your traditional logs as we

236
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,260
might um

237
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,440
think of in digital forensics this is

238
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,600
not a corporate logs and it's often not

239
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,740
architecture logs

240
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,959
so another question is why do we log on

241
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,180
these devices I have just told you that

242
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,339
this is a double-edged tool where there

243
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,279
are use cases for this one being

244
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,320
developers need to know that everything

245
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
is functioning as it should the

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,279
engineers want to know that it is

247
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,860
running as it should it's operating as

248
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,779
it should and if there is a problem that

249
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,420
is raised a problem in the field they

250
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,100
can then address it and do their own

251
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,380
incident response I think coming into

252
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,300
medical devices the one thing that I

253
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,459
realized is that developers do a large

254
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,620
portion of the incident response it's

255
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,420
just a slightly different perspective

256
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,420
they are debugging and solving client

257
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,240
issues that are occurring during the use

258
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,800
of the device

259
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,959
business wants to know how the devices

260
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,700
are functioning they want to know how

261
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,440
many is out there what they return on

262
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
investment is and they want to see

263
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,980
metrics in terms of performance

264
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,620
specifically as we update these devices

265
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,899
and update the software on it the

266
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,760
performance might start lacking because

267
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,480
the hardware can no longer support

268
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,459
the software that's run on it

269
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,279
now Security Professionals or the viral

270
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,500
people we want to see what's going on

271
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,540
whether we are being actively attacked

272
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,019
we want to know what our normal is so we

273
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,300
can spot the app normal we want to early

274
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,519
on detect that these devices are being

275
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,279
targeted and understand how how these

276
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,839
weaknesses are exploited

277
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,220
now the question I ask all the

278
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
developers three years ago is

279
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,260
is your logs designed for observability

280
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,899
do you know whether or not your you know

281
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,940
devices are being actively targeted

282
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,760
whether or not there is any exploitation

283
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,040
of any kind

284
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,899
um it's wanting to have vulnerabilities

285
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,820
that have been disclosed in a controlled

286
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,279
environment by researchers which is you

287
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,800
know it's God's work being done there we

288
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,899
need to know what's broken

289
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,120
what we do not know that any of those

290
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,060
have actively been exploited now I want

291
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,980
to make it clear medical devices are

292
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,220
built for the purpose of being a you

293
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,360
know life-saving life-sustaining device

294
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
they are not made to be a security

295
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,060
device and we need to understand that

296
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,920
requirement very carefully

297
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,440
that does not mean that they should be

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,220
unsecure but it is unfortunately part of

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,680
the world removing these devices last

300
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
for long the hardware cannot sustain all

301
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,620
the latest security updates for that

302
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,079
extended time so at one point it will

303
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,099
become vulnerable

304
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,700
I I always find this very um funny when

305
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,380
I do digital forensics or any instance

306
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,940
response and I say to them realize did

307
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,980
you have a look at your log when lost

308
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,500
did you actually clean your log

309
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,019
um what use is a log if we never look at

310
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,060
that so it's one thing to have

311
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,339
information contained in a log on a

312
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,139
device but if you never ingest that into

313
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,760
a central

314
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,940
um repository and actually actively look

315
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
at them they aren't useful at all

316
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,339
we cannot be reactive and constantly

317
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,800
want to go back and look at logs once we

318
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,320
have a disclosure or some someone has

319
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,300
let us know there's a problem and I

320
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,620
think this is the biggest thing that

321
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,120
we're struggling with is how do we

322
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,980
become more reactive versus proactive

323
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,959
now the logs are perfect I know exactly

324
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,579
what has happened said no incident

325
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,079
responder ever

326
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,899
after joining metronic as an independent

327
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,000
researcher and looking at logs on

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,220
various medical devices not just theirs

329
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,920
I soon realized that these logs were not

330
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,220
made or fit to make made for purpose to

331
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,019
actually do incident response and early

332
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,480
detection they were designed by

333
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,000
Developers for developers and didn't

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,200
include the security things we needed

335
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,779
so I went back to the beginning because

336
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,000
often that is where a story is Rewritten

337
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,940
and that was the design of the logs

338
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,459
so working with the developers we read a

339
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,380
book called The Unicorn project and the

340
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,240
Phoenix project that talks about the

341
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,579
simplified philosophies and we've

342
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,920
translated that over into how you can

343
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
actually look at log design

344
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,060
you should keep it simple structured and

345
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,399
detailed enough you should tag it and

346
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,800
use that metadata create what is not

347
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,980
there keep it clean and focused we all

348
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,899
know security debt I know it's a problem

349
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,300
but did you know that you can you know

350
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,880
accumulate that within your logs

351
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,920
assume that at some point you will be

352
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,779
compromised and make sure that you log

353
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,100
accordingly

354
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,579
do not live in the in in the philosophy

355
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,040
that you will not get attacked if you

356
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,779
assume that you've already been attacked

357
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,339
or will be attacked you'll be able to

358
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,019
log appropriately

359
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,240
consider who has access to the logs and

360
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,680
how they are stored and how they are

361
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,839
transported so these are the five

362
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,300
philosophies at a minimum that the

363
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,639
developers work with

364
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,399
how do I furthermore teach them that

365
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,500
it's important while we designed a tool

366
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,320
we derived it from the MDS Square which

367
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,779
is a manufactured disclosure statement

368
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,420
for medical devices that is filled out

369
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,339
that contains a lot of information

370
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,339
related to the medical devices security

371
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,220
now this is based upon nist and various

372
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,800
other regulations so we designed the

373
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,260
logging Benchmark project we use the

374
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,519
funnel approach by looking at

375
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,440
regulations that deal with logging and

376
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,959
deal with instant response we found best

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,660
practices by looking at owasp and the

378
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,639
various projects that they have there

379
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,519
and then good old-fashioned experience

380
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,620
that has been brought from various

381
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,360
developers and myself

382
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,899
so we designed a tool that we are able

383
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,480
to know what our problems are identify

384
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,880
them and fix them

385
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,519
now if you think about it we needed to

386
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,320
measure where our Legacy you know device

387
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,560
logs lie or they mature are they

388
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,320
completely you know unmature

389
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
and the reason we wanted a maturity

390
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,800
scoring is we needed a baseline to work

391
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,779
from we needed to know where we were

392
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,660
going where we are and how we get to

393
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,540
where we want to be which is mature logs

394
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,579
now one of my colleagues that works with

395
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,459
me often States we do not want a data

396
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,920
swamp we want a data Lake that contains

397
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,779
good logs

398
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,259
so this tool allows us to have controls

399
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,120
that have specific events underneath

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,940
them which we can measure to see whether

401
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,740
or not we can form we know we can find

402
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,259
that in the logs the teams often do it

403
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,839
and we come to the same conclusion this

404
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,019
is example we set a Target we move to

405
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,019
where we want to be in terms of the

406
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,759
various events under each of these

407
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,399
categories and we receive an actual

408
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,680
score and this school can be done

409
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,079
through various iterations within the

410
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
development process to make sure that

411
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,780
we're moving towards more robust logs

412
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,660
now the logs as I said is a double-edged

413
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,119
sword now you might wonder exactly what

414
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,579
do I mean with that

415
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,939
well often when I do

416
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,520
analysis of logs

417
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,339
we find that there are things that

418
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,500
people have forgotten about now

419
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,080
developers move in a general two-week

420
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,419
cycle of developments which are called

421
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,760
Sprints now in these Sprints new

422
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,919
features I introduced updates are done

423
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,120
changes are made now often logs contain

424
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,640
information that should be only in

425
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,919
debugging and shouldn't be within the

426
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:49,679
logs and they have been forgotten so

427
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,660
actively doing a log analysis and

428
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,940
actively cleaning them with the

429
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,039
development team that you know designs

430
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,280
the device designs the application

431
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,080
allows you to actually not have these

432
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,960
common mistakes in your logs you might

433
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
leave app keys and secrets which is like

434
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,740
the username and password on your

435
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,419
general machine

436
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,580
you might actually leave certificates

437
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,799
now generally we do not want to see

438
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,020
these in because it's a hygiene issue as

439
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,480
much as it is in security issues

440
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,440
JWT tokens is often forgotten and they

441
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,840
come from response bodies or the print

442
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
printf statement

443
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,160
as a digital forensics and incident

444
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,200
responder the printf statement has

445
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,980
become my enemy in terms of log design

446
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,679
it's often where mistakes happen events

447
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,080
that are not marked appropriately as

448
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,179
debug events but information level

449
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,760
events that sneak into your logs

450
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
these are common mistakes that all

451
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
organizations make

452
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,600
I have looked at not only one

453
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
manufacturer but other devices as well

454
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,840
and they suffer from the same problem

455
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,780
we have designed the logs but we haven't

456
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,900
taken Security in mind

457
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,240
now why did I go back to the developers

458
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,860
and not just try and fix it the

459
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,679
old-fashioned way well it's easier to

460
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,720
fix it at the start and draw a line in

461
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,059
the sand and say we're not going to pass

462
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,379
this by all behaviors

463
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,380
now at Medtronic I'm very proud to say

464
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,480
they have set a standard for logs they

465
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,760
have set a standard for how logs are

466
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,120
developed as well as

467
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,460
invested in educating developers in

468
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,500
doing logs better

469
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,200
the belief is good quality logs equals

470
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,660
good intelligence building good quality

471
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,900
logs allows us to derive our normal to

472
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,539
find our abnormal it's probably one of

473
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,660
the sayings I've taken for years from

474
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,400
science it's not your normal to know

475
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,679
you're abnormal once we have good

476
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,620
Baseline logs we are able to detect when

477
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,320
things go wrong and detect fast and

478
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,900
respond appropriately

479
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,179
it's moving with a common goal as an

480
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,340
organization now if you've worked at a

481
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,900
big organization and you realize that

482
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,080
things moves slower than normally but

483
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,720
having a common goal which is good logs

484
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,760
that allows the security team to have

485
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,100
observability

486
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,020
allows them to actually

487
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,799
move with one one end point in mind

488
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,020
large amounts of times are spent to

489
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,299
educate the developers to help them

490
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,280
understand what security is looking for

491
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,080
and forensics is looking for within

492
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,340
their logs

493
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,320
setting a standard when development

494
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,780
starts allows you to control whether

495
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,419
logs will end up

496
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,760
also building with the acceptance that

497
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,740
at one point it will be compromised but

498
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,539
you will have ensured that you have the

499
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,059
logs needed to detect and respond

500
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:49,740
appropriately

501
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,080
having common Frameworks and outputs

502
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,780
which means a standard structure for the

503
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,000
logs as well as logging Frameworks

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,039
depending on language

505
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
thinking about the data and what you

506
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,059
want from it and what you will do with

507
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,940
it a developer needs it for various

508
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,260
different reason than a security

509
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,780
practitioner or a business analyst would

510
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,299
need it we all look at the same data but

511
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,720
we need different things from it

512
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,020
now metronic has moved specifically in

513
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,179
the product Zone to think of logging as

514
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,460
a feature versus just a byproduct of

515
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,820
code

516
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,799
this means that we are busy developing

517
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,600
software requirements that includes

518
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,820
debugging metrics how the systems

519
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,100
performing the clear workflow of what's

520
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,460
happened security and incident response

521
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,280
Now setting requirements around logging

522
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,100
is a fairly new thing to include

523
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,380
different perspectives in one

524
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,900
and the teams that I've worked with has

525
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,240
taken to this with a fish like fish and

526
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,179
water and it has embraced looking at the

527
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,960
logs from a different set of eyes

528
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,200
now how do we know what to log well we

529
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,840
threat model of course well we use a

530
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,020
different tool called cornucopia

531
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,799
now Cornucopia allows developers to

532
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
become hackers and let me tell you the

533
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,539
most evil things come from the hands of

534
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,799
a developer

535
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,020
when they've identified that there are

536
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,520
specific threats that they cannot

537
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,799
address or talk away these items go into

538
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,380
a backlog which allows them to further

539
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,440
develop logging around that component as

540
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,659
I said before vulnerabilities will be

541
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,240
there an attacker only needs one open

542
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,659
window to compromise a system

543
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,240
finding ways to stick traps within your

544
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,919
logs

545
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,020
um is hot you know knowing that you've

546
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,760
been compromised as you know the first

547
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,220
part part of the battle to be won

548
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,100
so allowing them to do an inverted

549
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,620
stride using Cornucopia allows them to

550
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,480
think about how they potentially would

551
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,240
compromise the system allowing us to

552
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,640
find problems during development versus

553
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,240
after

554
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,640
now implantable devices let's face it

555
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,159
you've only got x amount of CPU Cycles

556
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,919
no patient wants to have frequent

557
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,799
battery changes I certainly do not I do

558
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,559
not want to do it every three years I

559
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,840
spoke to an engineer specifically on the

560
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,360
implanted and embedded department and I

561
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,400
had a whole list of security things I

562
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,799
wanted to have three years ago he looked

563
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:28,559
at me and he said to me so you want a

564
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,299
new device every three years

565
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,820
we have to acknowledge that the main

566
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,640
thing that's important on this device is

567
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,159
to keep a heart beating but that doesn't

568
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,320
mean logging is impossible it means we

569
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,659
have to think about it differently

570
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:44,340
versus having a full forensic log

571
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,140
perhaps we can use it as a trigger

572
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,240
device it's a plastic log that

573
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,860
potentially tells us that something

574
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,220
unfavorable has occurred making it part

575
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,500
of the workflow and thinking what would

576
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,100
not form part of the workflow

577
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,960
considerate considering considering when

578
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,940
the device operates when it's running

579
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,520
and how it functions

580
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,220
like no security should be draining on

581
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,600
the battery on these kinds of devices

582
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,559
acknowledging what your security

583
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,120
constraints are or your physical

584
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,980
constraints allows you to creatively

585
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,039
work on them so thinking of influence as

586
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:22,380
a signal to signal that something's gone

587
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,400
on

588
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,039
is a good way to have a very simplistic

589
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,480
logging on these devices

590
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,240
now the local principle is something we

591
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,500
all know in love

592
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,240
but it's often not something we've

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,580
designed or something we've built in it

594
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,280
it's a byproduct of how electronic

595
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,559
systems function

596
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,299
but one of the things we've been trying

597
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,539
to do is actually create in our econs in

598
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,520
the ecosystem of medical devices the

599
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,740
built-in low card principle so

600
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,600
fabricating the la carte principle

601
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,059
having the implants signal to the home

602
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,760
monitor that there is a log that needs

603
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,260
to be updated or that something has

604
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,080
occurred that being sent up to the

605
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,820
mobile application and to the Cloud

606
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,320
solution

607
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,419
or the other way

608
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,140
but building in the ability to form that

609
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,260
chain of events is important

610
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,960
the la carte principle is one of the

611
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,780
fundamentals that we follow in terms of

612
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,059
building data logs across the ecosystem

613
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,179
to have observability so having triggers

614
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,760
and traps that allow for the early

615
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,360
detection

616
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,260
now

617
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,240
we've come to the place where we have

618
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,760
logs what do we do with them

619
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
well there are some considerations when

620
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
it comes to having logs

621
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,179
we might have situations where there's

622
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,760
Phi and pii in

623
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,740
so steps should either be taken to

624
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,380
anonymize or scrape it or redacted

625
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,440
completely you should consider that your

626
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,779
logs is almost public information

627
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,520
because at some point that physical

628
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,340
device will not be in your position not

629
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,779
be in your control

630
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:09,179
so my recommendation is always not to

631
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,960
have bhi and pii if you do perhaps using

632
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,659
an open source solution to do you know

633
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,059
your seam or your ingestion is not a

634
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,539
good idea

635
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,179
building a scene takes a village and

636
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,880
this is kind of where we are

637
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,980
it's very complicated there's a lot of

638
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,320
moving Parts there's a lot of items

639
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,000
within the ecosystem

640
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,700
more importantly you don't want to break

641
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,500
a workflow and you don't want to cause a

642
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,419
device to stop functioning as I said

643
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:41,400
some of these are near and dear to

644
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,679
someone's heart

645
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,380
um or brain or it's what's keeping them

646
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,000
alive

647
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,860
uh one of the things we've looked at is

648
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,720
the Alps deck because it's very

649
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,179
versatile it allows us to build the

650
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,039
scene we want

651
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,140
so watch the space because this is still

652
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,059
work that's being done it's still work

653
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,980
that's been researched

654
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,100
but my dream is to build a medical scene

655
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
to have all those beautiful logs in our

656
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,440
data Lake ingested into one solution

657
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,539
that we can monitor and actually go and

658
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,940
say well we haven't had any devices that

659
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,159
have been compromised

660
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,120
again medical devices are bold to last

661
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,400
this means Legacy will always be a

662
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,580
problem Hardware will at some point not

663
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,740
be able to support software and firmware

664
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,080
updates so you will always deal with

665
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,820
Legacy devices there's no way to get

666
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,260
around it

667
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,720
this is the reason that this is often

668
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,120
targeted because we know that there's a

669
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,740
legacy problem

670
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,840
at some point as uncomfortable as this

671
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,740
is

672
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,799
all devices will be vulnerable once in a

673
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,000
lifetime

674
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,279
it's inevitable and we should log

675
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,880
accordingly

676
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,039
but what makes it harder

677
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,900
security and forensics is not a

678
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,820
one-size-fits-all

679
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,460
there isn't just one solution for all it

680
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,080
depends on the device and it logically

681
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,159
depends on what device's use case is

682
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,039
with that hopefully I haven't used all

683
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
my time and I want to do a special word

684
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,940
of things specifically to the Medtronic

685
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,200
CRM team

686
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,539
that has put up with me for many years

687
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,460
asking

688
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,580
poking prodding wanting to feed my

689
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,860
patient Curiosities and understand that

690
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,080
from a DFI or a perspective

691
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
for allowing me to work with them

692
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,120
integrate with them and go with them on

693
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,000
this journey specifically I want to say

694
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,760
thank you to Carl Erickson and Team

695
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,919
every developer that has loved logs

696
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,440
absolutely as hard as I have logs are

697
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,120
now my favorite thing

698
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
the university I work at that sometimes

699
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
supports you know that always supports

700
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,260
my crazy research the biohack village as

701
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,539
well as eBay should have a honorable

702
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,520
mention for having a Marketplace I can

703
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,320
obtain devices from

704
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,100
and with that if you have any questions

705
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,840
reach out to me but there will be Future

706
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,779
walk work in terms of actually scaling

707
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,240
this to larger organizations the

708
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,940
architecture for the team a logging by

709
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,740
design process which I have already

710
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,620
about 60 done

711
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,720
um a non-sensitive data analytics tool

712
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
which is also in in the pipeline and a

713
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,200
medical device incident response plan

714
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,240
thank you for listening to me and if you

715
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,299
have any questions please feel free to

716
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,779
reach out
