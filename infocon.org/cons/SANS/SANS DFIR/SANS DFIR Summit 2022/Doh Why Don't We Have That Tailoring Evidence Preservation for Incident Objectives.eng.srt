1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,599
good morning good afternoon good evening

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,940
yeah fire Summit

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,460
all right

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,880
uh don't why don't we have that so

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,039
this is a really cool topic uh it's

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,180
something that I thought about for a

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,699
really long time and it kind of melded

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,279
into this talk and I'm really pleased to

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,400
be back at the deeper Summit uh after a

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,140
couple year absence giving a talk even

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,700
though I'm not there this year I'm

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
really sorry for that

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
um but uh this is something that that

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,380
has kind of evolved over years of

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,059
working with customers so I'm really

17
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,579
excited to to present this today

18
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,000
a little about me uh Shelly giesberg uh

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,559
I am a director of instant response at

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,059
crowdstrike

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,640
um and where I started in the industry

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,460
was working on help desks helping people

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,500
do those basic day-to-day things but

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,879
that's really where I learned the skill

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,620
of that client Whisperer uh and that is

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,420
one of my favorite things about doing

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,700
what we do is being able to help people

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,880
get to somewhere where they need to be

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,500
um and we help people on some of the

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,880
worst days of their business lives we're

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,799
going to talk about the worst nightmares

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,619
today uh and and that's exactly why I

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,659
love this I'm a Lego Maniac and what

34
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,700
that means to me from the perspective of

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,080
incident responses when you think about

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,780
Lego you get a whole bunch of pieces and

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,299
you get a manual and you figure out how

38
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,820
to build this thing based on this manual

39
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,479
incident response for me is somebody a

40
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,579
threat actor came in and knocked our

41
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,520
Lego castle over uh our Hogwarts Lego

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,159
castle they've put it into thousands of

43
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,520
pieces and instant responders get

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,740
invited in to help rebuild the castle

45
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,960
without the manual

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,840
sometimes we have some pieces left over

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,100
but we try to get them into a better

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,560
place than they were before

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,299
um as you can see I am a bow tie

50
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,399
Enthusiast I wear them everywhere I

51
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,100
possibly can and I'm a very dedicated

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,479
dog Mama which I'm going to show you a

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,759
picture right at the end

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
all right

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,580
this today as I said comes from years of

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,180
talking to customers uh and figuring out

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,239
um why when we go in to do an

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,040
investigation there isn't always the

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,760
things that we want there

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,860
and when I say that I mean that I go

61
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,260
into customers and they say we need you

62
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,900
to help us find out this because our

63
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,760
worst nightmare has happened it has come

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,920
true and here are there are objectives

65
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,800
for the investigation and I say okay

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,959
let me help you with that

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,360
um but for one or another reason maybe

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
I'm not able to

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,540
my worst nightmare by the way is that

70
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,180
spider that's why it's on the slide uh

71
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,200
and

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,940
what I want to go through is not only

73
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,519
what the worst nightmare is but the way

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,140
it usually goes and then I'm going to

75
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,580
tell you about the way I think it should

76
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,959
go and that is starting at the bottom if

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,440
you will uh taken from a Drake song but

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
going from the worst nightmare taking

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,940
that and moving backwards what do we

80
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,620
need if we know what this is our worst

81
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,879
nightmare if we know this is what our

82
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,560
objectives are going to be for an

83
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,260
investigation then what do we need and

84
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,000
how do we work backwards to that so that

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,099
the preparation step uh that we're

86
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,860
taking that gives us all of those things

87
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,420
we're prepared so that when that worst

88
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,400
nightmare happens we we know that we've

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,900
got the right things in place

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,459
but that really depends on what kind of

91
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,659
organization you are and I'm going to

92
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,980
talk a lot about that I'm going to

93
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,420
generalize a lot about that but I'm

94
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,280
going to talk what sort of organization

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
you are and then how do we do that and

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,780
how do we do that is finding allies in

97
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,280
the in our business and then I'm going

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,019
to sort of recap everything

99
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,220
all right

100
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,700
so how it begins where do we start

101
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,319
it's Friday it's 4 P.M probably

102
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,760
you've been fighting with something all

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,879
week but now it's crucial it is your

104
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,060
officially your worst nightmare now when

105
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
I say this I want you to think for your

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,659
organization

107
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,239
what is your organization's worst

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,180
nightmare it might be being ransomed and

109
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,580
being hard down it might be having data

110
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,200
stolen because you're a data Rich

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,299
environment it might be many other

112
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,699
things so think about for your

113
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,399
organization what is your worst

114
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,720
nightmare I want you to think about that

115
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
as I'm going through the presentation

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,720
and kind of see where the alignment is

117
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,820
for your organization and how you might

118
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,220
fit this model uh to your organization

119
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,220
so maybe you've updated stolen that

120
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,840
might be your data Rich environment

121
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
maybe you have a pii you don't know what

122
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,800
was taking you don't know when it was

123
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
taking all those things are really

124
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,120
important or maybe you're an

125
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,979
organization that

126
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,060
sends out product that uh has to respond

127
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,340
to customers on on a very very tight

128
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
basis and you're hard down because

129
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,940
you've been fully encrypted and you

130
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,160
don't know how to recover so all those

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
things think of all those things and as

132
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,660
in anything all of these things are

133
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,540
going to depend on many many factors

134
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,759
all right

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,620
obligatory Canadian reference with the

136
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,919
beaver by the way my first question

137
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,780
usually when I approach a customer is

138
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,699
based on the things that you would like

139
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,280
to know do you have

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,160
any to look at do you have logs are you

141
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,940
keeping logs do you have some pcaps rare

142
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,360
but nice do you have netflow less rare

143
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,419
still very nice do you have an EDR

144
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:36,360
product in place also very nice a little

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,620
bit more common these days thank

146
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,139
goodness but

147
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,880
can I have some logs can I have

148
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,500
something to look at that is one of the

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,400
things that is uh probably the most

150
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
important and yet lacking thing in an

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,419
environment when we go with to do an

152
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,820
investigation uh and we ask questions

153
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,220
about what might be in place there's a

154
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,780
lot of reasons why evidence might not

155
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,060
exist in an environment

156
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,060
um maybe the ransomware over you know or

157
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,100
the threat actor overwrote them maybe

158
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,039
they deleted or damaged uh evidence or

159
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,840
files we see a lot of anti-forensics

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,880
when we go in and do investigations but

161
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,699
maybe they just don't exist because you

162
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,800
didn't know that you needed them you

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,180
didn't know that you needed to keep them

164
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,060
as long as you did or otherwise so that

165
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,680
is the number one reason is it just

166
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,780
doesn't exist sometimes we go with

167
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,880
default logging but the things that we

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,440
need to prove what we need to meet our

169
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,840
objectives don't exist in the default

170
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
logging

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,479
so

172
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,520
some other questions that I might ask

173
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,259
your organization if I come to help you

174
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,780
with an incident response

175
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,819
probably the top and most important one

176
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,039
is what is your objectives I can tell

177
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,259
you objectives that you might need and I

178
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,340
will tell you some of the most common

179
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,580
are of course if data was stolen

180
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,699
is it being is it B for sale how much

181
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,199
was taken

182
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,520
you know what do we have to be concerned

183
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,139
about and that's basically around data

184
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,539
Rich environments that are are heavy

185
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,440
with customer data pii Phi

186
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,220
Etc

187
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,660
so do you have protected information

188
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,160
that's really important because you need

189
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,259
to understand is there any notifications

190
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,120
that need to happen what's your timing

191
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,740
we talk about different states

192
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,380
particularly California or perhaps in

193
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,539
emea where we have gdpr we need to know

194
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,979
what the timelines are so we know when

195
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,080
we need to make our notifications what

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,360
other obligations might you have do you

197
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,740
have obligations to business partners

198
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,539
for instance do you need to ship product

199
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,759
by a certain date and if you don't your

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
entire business is over we need to know

201
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,259
that so we can help out with that

202
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,960
what about your most critical assets are

203
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,099
they down

204
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,340
and how what in what order they need to

205
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,139
come up who are the owners of those all

206
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,460
of those things you need to know in

207
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,900
advance

208
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,460
um and how long can you be down

209
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,099
interestingly enough it again it depends

210
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,840
on the type of organization that you are

211
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,940
some organizations if they're hard down

212
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,300
for an hour it's a huge problem some

213
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,220
organizations can be hard down for weeks

214
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,780
because they have paper processes in

215
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,160
place that they can that they can go

216
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,639
back to it depends on your organization

217
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,080
so

218
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,319
the answers as I said May and should

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,360
vary uh

220
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,759
not all things are equal for all

221
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,560
organizations

222
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,300
so it's going to be based on obviously

223
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,919
your industry

224
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,780
um healthcare for instance if we look at

225
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,460
that we've got a few different things

226
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,979
going on there patient data very very

227
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,620
critical obviously if it's stolen but

228
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,800
systems being hard down also incredibly

229
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,219
uh important specific organization maybe

230
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,599
your organization does something

231
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,520
differently than other people maybe

232
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,620
there's uh your business model is

233
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,200
slightly more advanced or or different

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
from other folks you have to think about

235
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,839
those things and again I want you to

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,860
think about in terms of your

237
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,360
organization what does your worst

238
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,519
nightmare look like based on these

239
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,480
things

240
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,060
uh I'm Canadian so I'm going to talk

241
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,160
about provincial laws but your local

242
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,920
state provincial federal laws May differ

243
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,420
but you also have to understand where

244
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,220
else you do business for instance I

245
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,440
worked for crowd study we do business in

246
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,180
multiple countries around the world and

247
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,300
when we think about uh data protection

248
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,240
uh and uh and and and just the nature of

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,860
doing business we have to understand the

250
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,779
laws and our obligations to each of

251
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,320
those countries uh we're and then you

252
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,800
have contracts Partners uh customers Etc

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,140
how do you deal with those when you have

254
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,940
when you have an incident and then what

255
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,560
do you need to deal with them there's so

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
many questions to ask and let's face it

257
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,480
that's a scary thing

258
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,399
so

259
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,380
this is the way that it normally goes

260
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,560
normally we do something like hmm

261
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm going to ask am I going on the

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,519
internet I'm going to figure out

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,160
what are the best practices what's out

264
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,459
there what do I need to know about

265
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,040
um what's nist telling me to do what are

266
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,160
the Sans org tell me to do there's lots

267
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,839
of models out there right for incident

268
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,540
response then we have to figure out how

269
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,880
much money do we have well we spent this

270
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,399
on this we spent this on this and

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,260
so we're gonna have to base we've got

272
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,940
these best practices and they say they

273
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,500
cost about this much but we've only got

274
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
about this much money

275
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
Okay so we've got about this much money

276
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,740
and there's best practices this is the

277
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,360
most important thing so we're going to

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,180
collect this because this is what we can

279
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,860
afford and this is the most important

280
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,480
thing according to all of these

281
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,800
standards

282
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
and how long do we need to keep it for

283
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,519
well I guess we're going to keep it for

284
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,500
as long as we can afford to or we're

285
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,060
going to recommend it right it's a

286
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,160
recommended might be a year or three

287
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,140
months or whatever you have

288
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,420
but can you afford to keep all those

289
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,459
logs maybe Farwell logs are you know

290
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,200
prohibitively expensive for you to store

291
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,019
and you could only store 24 hours that's

292
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,480
an extreme example I think but it

293
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,940
happens right so we so that's what we we

294
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,579
sort of normally see is uh well best

295
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,700
practice budget all about the money

296
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
what can we actually do

297
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,040
but does that answer the question of if

298
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,660
our worst nightmare came true do we have

299
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,940
what we need probably not now here's the

300
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,420
other model that I frequently see

301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,099
we've made absolutely no plan

302
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
that would mean thinking about what

303
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
we're doing

304
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,360
we're just going to collect whatever on

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,040
our what's ever coming up on our

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,660
firewalls whatever is on our servers

307
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,339
it's there we're probably not even going

308
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:28,019
to collect it it's just going to roll

309
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,180
whenever it does because we set it up as

310
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,220
a default there's absolutely no log

311
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,019
retention anywhere we're not sending the

312
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,760
logs to assist log we're not sending it

313
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,519
to a Sim or just you know letting it

314
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,040
right out and we're hoping that an

315
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,540
incident doesn't happen thoughts and

316
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,700
prayers to you

317
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,399
I see this more often than I'd like to

318
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,100
and the problem with that is is then I

319
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,620
get asked tell me all the things when

320
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,779
there's an incident happen and I say

321
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,820
I would love to

322
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,500
but mostly I just have thoughts and

323
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,040
prayers for you

324
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,079
so this is what I'm suggesting this is

325
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,399
something that again I've been thinking

326
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,899
about for years and it kind of came

327
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,760
together in the last year in in this

328
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,779
format

329
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,779
I want you and your organization to sit

330
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,339
down and say for us this is the worst

331
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,800
case scenario that could happen to us is

332
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,779
that losing data is that being hard down

333
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,660
is that both who knows

334
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,180
and if that happens

335
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,060
what do we need to know do we need to

336
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,920
know what data went out so we can make

337
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,680
notifications and who we need to notify

338
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,480
do we need to know what our critical

339
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
asset list is and how and how they need

340
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,740
to come up and in what order so that we

341
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,839
can get back to production

342
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,519
all of those things I want you to think

343
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,079
about in advance what are the objectives

344
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,700
that you would need out of an

345
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,240
investigation

346
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,680
and then from there you're going to

347
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,839
figure out from the objectives then what

348
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,660
do I need what evidence what logs what

349
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,519
sources of information well I need to

350
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
help me answer those objectives

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,820
and the last thing is how am I going to

352
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,680
do that so the how is probably one of

353
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
the biggest questions as well right

354
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,800
we've got all these things and we still

355
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
have to do we still have to contend with

356
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,380
budget and all those other things so how

357
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,480
do we do that

358
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,880
all right

359
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,459
this depends on

360
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,660
what kind of organization you are

361
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,680
and I'm going to do a lot of

362
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,579
generalizing here so uh there are lots

363
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,079
of different types of organizations and

364
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,300
as I went back to I said there was you

365
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,680
know types of business models your

366
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,320
specific organization your industry your

367
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,980
region all of those things play into it

368
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,480
but we're going to talk about three

369
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,279
specific types of organizations because

370
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm going to generalize a whole lot one

371
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,540
is as I said the data Rich organizations

372
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,180
those are organizations where the number

373
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,180
one thing that they have is their data

374
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,940
that might be proprietary information uh

375
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,779
or

376
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,300
whatever what have you but whatever they

377
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,459
do that data needs to be protected

378
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,740
doesn't the platform itself doesn't

379
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,260
matter the hardware doesn't matter but

380
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,320
we need to protect that data

381
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,060
then we have the asset Rich environment

382
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,940
that is the environment where if they

383
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,160
don't keep things running doesn't matter

384
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
if the data is transiting through or not

385
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,639
they don't keep the environment running

386
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,740
they can't do what they're going to do

387
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,959
maybe those are invest industrial

388
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,300
companies production companies many

389
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,279
other things and then we have

390
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,200
organizations where both of those things

391
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,940
are equally important or at least

392
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,680
important to the point where they both

393
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
have to be considered

394
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,980
so I'm going to delve a little bit more

395
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,260
into each one of those and kind of go

396
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,699
through the steps of that uh objectives

397
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:50,519
uh what how Etc so

398
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,500
from a data Rich perspective and I'm

399
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,300
actually taking this out of some of the

400
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,339
cases that I've worked on

401
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,680
um so I have I have intimate knowledge

402
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,720
of why these things are are important to

403
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,000
each type of organization so software

404
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,040
development company

405
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,519
uh let's say that your company develops

406
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:12,360
the brand new amazing game that

407
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,839
everybody wants to play

408
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,440
and your your source code is possibly

409
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360
having been stolen by a threat actor and

410
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,100
they're threatening to release it which

411
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,779
means your company is going to lose

412
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,940
millions of dollars if your source code

413
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,459
is released on the dark web or anywhere

414
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,480
else

415
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
that is the worst case scenario for your

416
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
organization

417
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,760
so

418
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,459
objective wise we're really going to be

419
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,139
data heavy here so we're going to think

420
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,899
about you know what was taken we want to

421
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,160
understand what was taken so we can

422
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,019
understand what that scope is how much

423
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,459
do we need to be concerned did they take

424
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,760
a little bit do they have the whole the

425
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
whole code Repository

426
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
um and and then how did it happen how

427
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
did they get in so that's a big one as

428
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,160
well right uh because we want to make

429
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,899
sure that that doesn't happen again we

430
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:01,980
want to make sure that we've stopped it

431
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,959
from happening currently and was there

432
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,300
any back doors all the things that we

433
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,040
need to think about do they still have

434
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,620
access to an environment even if we say

435
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,660
protect the code repository are they

436
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,639
coming back in do they have their claws

437
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,639
in anywhere else how do we know that

438
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,500
and then who needs to know about this

439
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
when we think about an investigation

440
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,139
again internally externally Partners

441
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,940
legislators uh Regulators all those

442
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,579
things who needs to know in this case so

443
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,279
this this in this case might include

444
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,560
customer data as well so maybe that's an

445
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,240
important employee that we need to take

446
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,339
into effect so let's start thinking

447
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,839
about that

448
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,139
um from my experience and your mileage

449
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,660
may vary one of the best ways to figure

450
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,300
out what left your environment is

451
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,540
network data thank you Phil Hagan uh for

452
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,120
teaching me all about network data

453
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,519
the best way to understand what left

454
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,560
your environment is pcapp

455
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,440
um and I and I see uh Dan has asked a

456
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
question you know half joking has anyone

457
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,540
ever have a client who pcaps yes but

458
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,939
very rare as I said uh but it is

459
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,040
obviously the number one really good way

460
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,559
to say this left the environment because

461
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,079
we've got source and destination we've

462
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
got we've got uh uh the actual packets

463
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,220
we've got uh we've got times all of

464
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,260
those things wrapped up into a lovely

465
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,540
lovely pcap packet

466
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,520
um to tell us all of the things unusual

467
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,740
perhaps right but network data is the

468
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,200
best way for us to tell to to see that

469
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,320
netflow if you can right

470
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,880
um also follow and folder access right

471
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
so who access what now uh you can do

472
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,260
that in any number of ways I'm not going

473
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,840
to go into every single artifact but

474
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
um being able to obviously interrogate

475
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,620
systems and understand what sort of file

476
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,720
folder access went on there's commercial

477
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,460
products out there that help you do that

478
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,200
there's also our artifacts on the disk

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,020
obviously that help you do that as well

480
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,280
we also might want to look at process

481
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,520
execution was tools like we see them

482
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,940
very often our clone x copy do we see

483
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,860
anything like that any archiving

484
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,240
software that looks like there might

485
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,280
have been data staging so all of those

486
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,140
things we might want to we might want to

487
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,720
to be looking at to collect how about

488
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,179
logs a ton of logs might be interesting

489
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,559
right DNS for instance uh if you go back

490
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,059
in time dnf is one of my favorite things

491
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,039
in the whole world right but DNS traffic

492
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,520
tells us what uh what domains were

493
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,620
requested within our environment was it

494
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,799
drop me files was it share file was it

495
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,679
any number of shady Shady file sharing

496
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,539
sites that we wouldn't normally use

497
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:40,919
within our environment that we might

498
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,360
want to know about that was you know

499
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,940
used at a particular time

500
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,200
um I'll give you an example actually

501
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,600
from a from a case that I worked

502
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,160
um they were keeping all of their

503
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,960
process execution events

504
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
awesome

505
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
but no one noticed apparently the

506
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,500
monitoring wasn't as good no one noticed

507
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,400
that uh that somebody had been using uh

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,000
x copy and our clone on on servers bad

509
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,820
bad bad but also nobody noticed that

510
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,679
those same servers that were using our

511
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,679
clone also had uh uploads to Mega so

512
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,679
file trial transfer software to a file

513
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
transfer site on multiple servers over

514
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,880
time they had the information and they

515
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,080
didn't use it that's a whole other

516
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,640
question that's a whole other problem

517
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,860
unfortunately but those are the kinds of

518
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,360
of evidence that are going to help us

519
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,280
get to that so those are the things that

520
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,299
those are the things that we want to be

521
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,280
looking at those that's the what now the

522
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
how is how long do we have to have it so

523
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,380
again that is going to be based on a

524
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,000
number of things for your organization

525
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,340
we have customer data

526
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,840
um we want to keeping a little bit

527
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,280
longer to make sure that we understand

528
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,799
you know what's been gone

529
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,020
um and also how will we collect it right

530
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,820
so do we have somewhere to store all

531
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,140
this information do we've assist logged

532
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,660
do we have a seam and and and and and

533
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,220
where will we store it will we

534
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,140
decentralize it will be somewhere you

535
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,580
know we'll be somewhere centrally let's

536
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,780
see

537
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,059
um and last but not least how long do we

538
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,520
need it for right so

539
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,960
um how long do we keep it for and I

540
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,039
think I missed the first one which is

541
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,720
how long do we have notification Wise

542
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,460
from a customer perspective how long do

543
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,080
we have until we have to notify folks we

544
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,360
have to be you have to have that rush so

545
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,380
all of those things we have to think

546
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
about from a data Rich perspective but

547
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,380
those are some of the things that I

548
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,460
would think about

549
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,559
um if you were talking about a data Rich

550
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,940
environment

551
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,039
all right

552
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,860
uh this should say asset rich and I

553
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,419
obviously have screwed up my slide this

554
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,419
should be asset Rich manufacturers

555
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,200
so I worked a case a few years ago for a

556
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,120
company that

557
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,660
um has very hot ovens essentially that

558
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,220
make their product

559
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,840
and

560
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,679
I asked them how long would it take you

561
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,720
to recover if those were hard down think

562
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,240
about a stuxnet type event where perhaps

563
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,940
a threat actor was able to uh compromise

564
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,179
the software that ran uh that ran your

565
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,679
heavy duty equipment

566
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,559
and they said it would take three weeks

567
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,660
to cool the ovens down

568
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,059
so once they were affected those ovens

569
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,100
would take three weeks to cool down

570
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,380
and then it would take another three to

571
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,900
four weeks once they fixed everything to

572
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,340
heat them up again so they were going to

573
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,240
be down minimum for six to seven weeks

574
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,120
if something like this happened and they

575
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,500
would not be able to ship product which

576
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,419
they did on a daily basis around the

577
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,740
world

578
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,419
and that would have been devastating to

579
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,340
them as a company so think about that

580
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,559
from the perspective of if a threat

581
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,880
actor really hits you with ransomware

582
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,260
and all your systems are hard down

583
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,320
perhaps a stock snap type event where uh

584
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,720
your actual means of making the things

585
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,980
that you do are not able to run and

586
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,380
so their biggest objective was getting

587
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,780
back up and running

588
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,120
but at the time they had no idea that

589
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,799
that could actually do it so again

590
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,419
they're also going to want to know how

591
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,860
did it happen

592
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,960
uh they also want to know you know was

593
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,220
there any lateral movement are they

594
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,720
anywhere else in the environment that we

595
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,220
need to know about and what else did

596
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,840
they do they brought us hard down but

597
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,580
what else did they do

598
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,200
so number one for this type of

599
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,539
organization for me is a critical asset

600
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,380
list

601
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,840
and that includes things like not only

602
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,580
what the systems are but who their

603
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,900
owners are

604
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,940
what data stored on them what software

605
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,679
is on those how do we bring them back up

606
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,440
so the recovery priorities what order do

607
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,520
we have to bring stuff in if you think

608
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,580
about something like industrial ovens

609
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,440
there may be a specific order that

610
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,299
things have to be brought back up in so

611
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,159
those are all those things that we would

612
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,419
need to know but also logs right so logs

613
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,120
are all the things right what happened

614
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,360
on those systems what sort of uh what

615
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,580
sort of uh actions happen process

616
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,539
execution uh the network data so was

617
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,919
anything was anything Associated

618
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,140
interesting but more interesting what

619
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,240
came in where did they go where did they

620
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,340
come from and file and folder access

621
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,440
what did they touch so there's a lot of

622
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,140
repeat here you're going to see that but

623
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,520
again it's just thinking about for your

624
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,260
organization how do we answer those

625
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,880
objectives

626
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,860
the next part is how long can we be down

627
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,720
for and I talked about this with respect

628
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
to to the organization that I did the

629
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,799
investigation with how long could they

630
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,059
be down

631
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,280
um they couldn't possibly be down that

632
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
long but that's how long they would be

633
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,700
down right so you have I had to look at

634
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,440
it at two different perspectives which

635
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,659
is we probably can't be down for more

636
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,820
than a week but if those ovens go down

637
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,280
we're gonna be down for six weeks so

638
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,100
making a plan somewhere in between there

639
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,559
um is and understanding those limits is

640
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,360
a really really big thing and what

641
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,159
should we be recovering first what

642
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,440
servers need to be recovered first uh is

643
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,380
there a particular you know uh way that

644
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,880
they have to be done is there particular

645
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,280
order that they have to be done in

646
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,539
um what sort of you know how do we have

647
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:56,280
the software available all of these

648
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,900
things need to be understood so we can

649
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,760
meet that objective of getting back up

650
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,940
and running

651
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,380
then from the evidence perspective again

652
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,760
we're going to answer those questions of

653
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,620
how will we collect that data any of the

654
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,080
logs the network data Etc how will we

655
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,120
collect that data where are we going to

656
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,320
store it you'll notice there's a theme

657
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,960
here and how long do we need it for

658
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,760
um in this particular situation maybe we

659
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,320
don't have pii we don't have

660
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,900
notifications to make to folks um so

661
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
maybe we don't have to keep it as long

662
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,299
but maybe there's some industrial

663
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:26,640
regulations that say we have to keep a

664
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,799
certain a certain information that long

665
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,299
so those are the things that we need to

666
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:32,520
know so that we can make that plan and

667
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,760
ensure that we can go backwards

668
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,340
from that worst case scenario

669
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,100
and get to that point of preparation or

670
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,659
we feel good about the fact that if the

671
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,520
source case scenario happens we'll be

672
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,159
able to handle it

673
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,200
last one wow I'm really good at these

674
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,539
slides asset and data Rich healthcare

675
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:54,659
provider and I thought I went over these

676
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,320
so asset and data Rich Healthcare

677
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,120
Providers are a really great example and

678
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,320
I kind of went over this a little bit

679
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,280
but

680
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,440
we have two angles to look at for

681
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,780
healthcare providers obviously one of

682
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,299
those is is basic patient care and that

683
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,179
probably trumps anything right is if

684
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,720
machines aren't running then we can't do

685
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,340
our job

686
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,120
um as as as as First Responders and

687
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,500
let's face it our First Responders over

688
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,299
the last few years have you know saved

689
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:27,299
our butts uh any number of millions of

690
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,640
times unfortunately

691
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,220
um so if they can't do their job then

692
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,500
we're not safe as patients

693
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,100
um

694
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,860
anyone who's done a healthcare case

695
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,000
knows that systems in in hospitals

696
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,940
particularly are generally quite old I

697
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,700
myself a few years ago ran into a

698
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,559
hospital bed that was running Windows

699
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,299
2000 that was impacted with configure

700
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,220
um and and that was just kind of

701
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,980
floating around in the hospital so we

702
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,299
need to be worried about patient care

703
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,419
obviously that's number one but also

704
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:06,600
um if there's patient data stolen so if

705
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,600
it's encrypted if it's if it's stolen

706
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,760
and they threaten to release it that's a

707
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,200
whole other ball of wax from a PR

708
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,880
perspective from a notification

709
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,860
perspective so those two things kind of

710
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,179
ride side by side although I would say

711
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,159
that patient care probably is a little

712
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,900
bit higher obviously

713
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,539
so objectives

714
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,919
um all of the things that we talked

715
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,159
about but specifically the data

716
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,580
notification perspective what was taken

717
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,279
um how much was taken and how was it

718
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,080
taken right so how did how did they get

719
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,840
it out how much was taken

720
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,279
um and what was taken that what was

721
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,380
taken is the hardest question for any

722
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,600
instant responder to answer

723
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
and as I said thank you Phil Hagen

724
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,640
network data trumps all in that

725
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,140
perspective

726
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,900
um but additionally from uh data from a

727
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,580
objectives perspective we're going to

728
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,140
want to know again root cause how did

729
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,460
they get in

730
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,260
um what else have they done so lateral

731
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,360
movement where are they persisting in

732
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
the environment uh to make sure that

733
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,380
they're they're not no longer persisting

734
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,179
there and that we can go back to normal

735
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,059
operations are the patients safe right

736
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:14,700
are the systems now safe have we have we

737
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,919
properly evicted the threat actor have

738
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,900
systems properly been remediated all of

739
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,039
those things are going to be objectives

740
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,380
for a healthcare provider and all the

741
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,000
things that we need to look at so from

742
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,520
want again this one's this one's a tough

743
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,980
one because it's kind of all the things

744
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,020
um network data again

745
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,059
um it's going to be a tough one because

746
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,080
we're going to have that we're going to

747
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,299
run up into that budget thing again but

748
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,340
when we look at that worst case scenario

749
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,260
and we think about the questions that

750
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,820
we're going to have to answer

751
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,100
we kind of want to prioritize again the

752
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,380
things that we need and for me

753
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,100
um things like network data EDR uh and

754
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
uh and uh

755
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,659
network data EDR

756
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,240
and I'm losing my mind here

757
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,799
um are the things that we want to talk

758
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,659
about the logging sorry and logging so

759
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,179
OS logging um and and indeed we do

760
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,340
Beyond default are the things that we

761
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,200
want to know about as much as we

762
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
possibly can

763
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
so we can answer those questions

764
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,940
particularly around notifications those

765
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,020
are the things that the lawyers care

766
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,539
about so how do we balance those things

767
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,620
I think that's a really important

768
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,360
question when we get to the how

769
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,460
again patient care tends to at least in

770
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,919
the immediate time trumps anything else

771
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,200
and then we get into you know the the

772
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,179
data but we have to balance those things

773
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,340
from from a budget perspective

774
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,480
um and understand what the most

775
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,159
important thing is

776
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,840
how long do we need to keep things all

777
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
of those things still play in because

778
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,900
now we're dealing with notifications

779
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,140
patients actual people so it's a really

780
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,360
big question to have to answer

781
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,340
so the question is

782
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,960
how do we do all that and the answer and

783
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,140
I learned this at the feet of robly is

784
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,580
it depends

785
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,000
it depends on your organization

786
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
it depends on the laws that you're

787
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,779
subject to it depends on what was taken

788
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,940
what kind of organization you are I'm

789
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,559
going to go back to that over and over

790
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,340
and over again

791
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,700
so the best thing that I have found is

792
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,740
once you understand what your objectives

793
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,320
are

794
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,659
once you understand what you need and uh

795
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,360
and and how you might do that you need

796
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,220
to get friends within your organization

797
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,039
and Beyond to help you make the case

798
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,140
so we have Ally types for three

799
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,059
organizations and again I'm generalizing

800
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,620
quite a bit here

801
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,600
but

802
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,580
you'll notice that the legal teams are

803
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,799
big all the way across honestly some of

804
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,600
your best friends internal counsel and

805
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,039
external counsel for your organization

806
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,899
are some of your best friends for when

807
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,940
you're doing this

808
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,880
and the reason for that is

809
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,120
because when you are talking to

810
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,960
organizations uh and you say to a lawyer

811
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,940
this is our worst case scenario and they

812
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,100
go it is our worst case scenario in fact

813
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,960
I would have them sit with you and come

814
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,240
up with your worst case scenario because

815
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,179
they're gonna know some ideas around

816
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:10,799
what your worst case scenario maybe more

817
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,360
than what you thought of a lot of times

818
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
as technical folks we tend to go to the

819
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,140
technical thing as the worst case

820
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,100
scenario

821
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,500
and maybe as an organization the legal

822
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,659
team or the privacy officer or even the

823
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,820
CEO has some ideas about what their

824
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,380
worst case scenario is in getting that

825
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,000
input and understanding what that is is

826
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,820
a great idea

827
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,740
if you've got those folks with you and

828
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,659
say this is our worst case scenario and

829
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,880
these are our objectives for that

830
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,200
investigation

831
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
and you can say to them here's how I'm

832
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,700
going to help you answer those

833
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,279
objectives in the best way possible and

834
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,500
this is what I need

835
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,620
you will be much better uh in in place

836
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,260
to get support to get those things

837
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,820
happening again

838
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,620
there's prioritization that needs to

839
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,960
happen obviously but that kind of

840
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,000
friendship within the organization will

841
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
help you put those things in place

842
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,260
other things that you need to be aware

843
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,299
of for friends obviously is in data Rich

844
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,559
environments we want to know who those

845
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,720
data owners are they're very invested in

846
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,580
protecting the data that belongs to them

847
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,580
and their applications so they're good

848
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,679
friends to have when we talk about datum

849
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:18,960
going missing data being damaged in an

850
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,919
organization

851
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,200
and then asset Rich environment you're

852
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,299
going to want to know who owns those

853
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,980
assets who keeps them up and running who

854
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,380
keeps the patient care data system up

855
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,580
and running

856
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,799
who keeps the the respirators up and

857
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,260
running in in a hospital all those

858
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,580
things you want to know who owns those

859
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,840
because they're going to be very

860
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,700
invested in keeping the things that they

861
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,260
run up and running they're going to be

862
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,399
good friends of yours how about the

863
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,020
sales folks for asset Rich environments

864
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,720
if you are down for any long period of

865
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,000
time they're going to be able to say to

866
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,080
you

867
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm going to support you in any way I

868
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,860
can to make sure that I make my quota

869
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,320
because if we can't we we can't ship

870
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,059
anything then I'm not selling anything

871
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:59,039
and I'm not making my quota and I'm not

872
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,020
making my bonus so I'm going to help you

873
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,760
in any way possible to get you what you

874
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,440
need

875
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,380
so I'm going to recap

876
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,200
the path to less dough I think it's a

877
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,539
good book title

878
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,399
I want you to think about what is your

879
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,200
worst nightmare for your organization

880
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,279
What Makes You Sweat at night what makes

881
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,140
the legal team in your organization

882
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,899
think this is it we're done it's over

883
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,200
have that conversation internally

884
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,960
and if that happens what are your

885
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,840
objectives what do you need to know who

886
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,460
do you need to tell

887
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,799
so if you have Regulators that you need

888
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,419
to talk to what are the things that they

889
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,039
need to know if there's timelines that

890
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,960
you need to meet what are those that you

891
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,039
need to meet

892
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,080
find out what your objectives are is it

893
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,419
the data is it getting it up and running

894
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,460
understand what that is understand what

895
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,360
your limits are as an organization

896
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,500
and then what do you need to meet the

897
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,120
objectives what sources of evidence

898
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,440
information uh what sort of you know

899
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,000
data do you need in place to help you

900
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,500
meet those objectives to answer the

901
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,659
questions to your legal team to your

902
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,640
object to your executive to your

903
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,940
business partners to law enforcement to

904
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,500
Regulators what do you need to meet

905
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,860
those objectives

906
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,600
and then where can you collect what you

907
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,899
need so in your environment

908
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:25,740
when you have that list of what you need

909
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,380
where do you find it is it there does it

910
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,039
even exist

911
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,779
if it doesn't exist

912
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,760
maybe figure out how it does I'm going

913
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,740
to give you an example default logging

914
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,240
maybe that doesn't have what you need in

915
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,100
it think about using for instance a

916
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,779
sysmon configuration to give you some

917
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,940
more enriched logging

918
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,799
figure out if you're sending your

919
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,260
firewall logs to an MSP but they can

920
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,620
only give you an hour at a time uh to do

921
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,419
any investigation maybe that's not right

922
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,000
the right uh the right solution for you

923
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,760
maybe it's something else a lot of msps

924
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,279
your mileage may vary right some of them

925
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,919
are great but

926
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,179
um I think you just have to think about

927
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:08,580
those things think of what you need and

928
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,080
make sure you have it in place and ask

929
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,119
those questions and then how long do you

930
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,560
need it for

931
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,339
um

932
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:16,918
there is again school of thought best

933
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,239
practices there's going to be regular

934
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,460
regulations PCI has a bunch of

935
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,839
regulations around how long you need to

936
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,580
keep things for need to understand for

937
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,139
your organization worst case scenario

938
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,980
how long do you need to keep things for

939
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,359
and then figure out where you're going

940
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,859
to put those things if you need a year

941
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,899
of logs for certain things you're going

942
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,280
to need somewhere to put it which means

943
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,500
you need budget to uh to be able to do

944
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,300
that you need a place to store you need

945
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,859
a safe place to store all of those

946
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,780
things that you need to think about when

947
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,359
you're putting your plan together

948
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,699
and last but not least I didn't add this

949
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,320
in the rest of the Oregon and the rest

950
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,080
of presentation but have you documented

951
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,139
all the things right so you now know

952
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,180
what your worst case scenario is you've

953
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,859
got your objectives that you've you've

954
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:00,780
talked about with all the stakeholders

955
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,180
you know what you need you know how long

956
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,460
you need it and you figured out where

957
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,839
you're going to store it

958
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,480
and then you decide to move on to

959
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,359
another company at some point

960
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,339
did you write it down so that everybody

961
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,820
else can continue doing it I hope so

962
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,060
that is the last step

963
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,520
and I and at this point I'm going to say

964
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,160

965
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,300

966
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,980
