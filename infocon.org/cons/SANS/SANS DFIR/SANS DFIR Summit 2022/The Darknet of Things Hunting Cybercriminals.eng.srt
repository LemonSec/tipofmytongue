1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,139
welcome to my talk on the dark net of

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,000
things which uh you know I really

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,280
created with the goal of teaching you

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,199
know some of you how we can research and

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,720
collect Intelligence on uh different

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,640
types of you know cyber criminal

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,500
activity

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,180
um you know but first a little bit about

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,619
me you know I've been in the

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,199
intelligence Community for about 15

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,900
years uh you know working in you know

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,239
various uh roles for like the Department

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,059
of Defense from counterintelligence to

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,880
Tactical second to human intelligence

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,460
collection to then pivoting and working

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,680
in the private sector within cyber

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,500
threat intelligence and today I'm the

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,239
head of the equinix threat analysis

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,020
Center or as we call it etac I'm also a

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,300
Sans faculty member and soon to be

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,539
author of The forensic 589 cyber crime

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,699
intelligence course and then last but

24
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,280
not least I'm a husband and soon to be

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,099
father of two

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,640
so looking at to looking at uh the the

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
agenda for today

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,659
um we're going to be defining cyber

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,299
crime intelligence and discussing some

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,119
of the more introductory topics of you

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,580
know cyber criminal operations and uh

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,900
some of the different tools that we can

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,960
use to track criminal activity uh we'll

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,380
also be looking at a case study um now I

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,600
originally wanted to do two case studies

36
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,939
but I really found that I wasn't going

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,659
to end up having enough time uh to do to

38
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,700
uh unfortunately

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,619
um so you know we'll be focusing on a

40
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,439
follow the actor case study uh but you

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,939
know for those of you who are interested

42
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,400
in the fall the money case uh case study

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,399
I've left those slides in the pdf

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,259
version that you can download through

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,540
Sans and that should hopefully give us

46
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,880
enough time at the end for uh q a

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
so you know that brings us to the

48
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,320
question of the day which is you know

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,079
what is cyber crime intelligence uh you

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,119
know this is a subset of cyber threat

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,979
intelligence and you know as such it's

52
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,959
gonna have kind of a similar sounding

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,640
definition

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,500
um except cyber crime intelligence is

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,720
you know primarily focused on collecting

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,640
and analyzing activity on Cyber

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
criminals

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,700
um you know we can do this through you

59
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,379
know the use of multiple intelligence

60
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,300
disciplines uh you know which I'll

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,120
highlight on a later slide uh but this

62
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
course you know it looks at you know

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
some of the the the intelligence that's

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,599
oftentimes overlooked uh within the

65
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,700
cyber security Community which includes

66
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,260
things like you know Financial

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,379
operations on and off the blockchain uh

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,720
you know so Financial intelligence uh as

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,519
well as uh how we can use human

70
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,319
intelligence collection in the virtual

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,019
environment you know CTI has kind of

72
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,180
traditionally looked at intrusions from

73
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,000
uh the victim's perspective where we'll

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
be discussing you know how to gain

75
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,599
visibility into ad adversary

76
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,519
infrastructure for the purpose of

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,379
intelligence collection from the

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,840
adversary's perspective uh you know and

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
really the other part of this that I

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,319
think is kind of important to call out

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,140
is this course is going to be focused on

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,379
uh disruption and attribution and you

83
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,659
know how can we get to attribution how

84
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,220
to measure confidence and attribution

85
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,140
and you know how to work with law

86
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,700
enforcement and building a case against

87
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,340
a person uh that's actually behind the

88
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,200
keyboards uh you know and really the

89
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,300
message that I want to try and get

90
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,040
across here is that you know I know

91
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,140
attribution is hard but that doesn't

92
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,339
mean that we shouldn't try

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,420
and of course you know this wouldn't be

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,519
an Intel presentation if I didn't throw

95
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,440
you know the intelligence life cycle in

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,480
here at some point so you know for those

97
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,879
of you unfamiliar with what this is uh

98
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,799
this is known as the intelligence life

99
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,440
cycle uh you know and with any kind of

100
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,780
intelligence collection we have to first

101
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,180
start with planning and Direction uh

102
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,799
which includes things like our

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,200
intelligence requirements uh which could

104
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
you know come in the form of a request

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,819
for information or RFI or you know if

106
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,280
you work in law enforcement could be an

107
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,680
assignment to a new case or a tasking

108
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,900
related to a suspect you know really

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,000
regardless of whether you're in the

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,680
private or public sector you know once

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,720
we have these requirements you know we

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,940
now have our marching orders to go and

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,919
then collect you know everything that we

114
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,900
can collect to help support those

115
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,360
requirements uh and of course you know

116
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,460
you know how we process and exploit that

117
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,660
intelligence may look different

118
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,639
depending on you know the type of

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
intelligence we've collected you know

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,240
human is going to be you know more

121
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,520
focused on exploiting you know the

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,080
person you through the different

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,600
approaches that we use or you know if

124
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,280
we're collecting Financial intelligence

125
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,660
you know we may have collected a

126
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,240
suspect's cryptocurrency wallet uh you

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,340
know and we find that it's located at an

128
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,139
exchange that collects uh know your

129
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,139
customer information or kyc uh you know

130
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,580
and then we may want to submit a request

131
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,380
to that exchange for details on the

132
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,000
wallet's owner

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,040
um you know and and then following uh

134
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,900
processing we've got analysis and

135
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,300
production of all that was collected you

136
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
know this is where we may want to

137
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,259
measure our confidence and attribution

138
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,080
you know for example if we uh you know

139
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,900
get the name or say an LLC name that's

140
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,900
tied to the sole owner uh of that

141
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,460
account from that exchange that we

142
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,160
submitted the kyc request to you know is

143
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,840
there any other evidence that points to

144
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,240
that individual or is that the sole

145
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,580
evidence pointing to that person

146
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,919
um and then you know last but not least

147
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,320
um I updated this to say dissemination

148
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,180
and disruption and and this could come

149
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,400
in the form of you know seizing a

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,620
criminal's cryptocurrency wallet or

151
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,539
taking down adversary infrastructure

152
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,460
such as like what we saw with private

153
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,380
Public Partnerships with like emotech

154
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,360
and trickbot takedowns you know so we'll

155
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,039
be looking at things like you know how

156
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,199
do we disrupt criminal activity when is

157
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,060
the right time to disrupt criminal

158
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,039
activity and things along the lines of

159
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,219
that

160
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,979
and next we're going to be looking at

161
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,720
the uh who the what the when the where

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
the why and the how of cyber criminal

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,300
operations and you know this should

164
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,740
hopefully you know help to better

165
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,240
visually depict you know some of the

166
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,740
more technical topics that we'll be

167
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,500
covering today uh so you know following

168
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,080
this who what when where why model uh

169
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,400
looking at who we're going to be

170
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,199
investigating today we've got wizard

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,199
spider we've got the developer behind

172
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,360
the jigsaw and Thanos ransomware which

173
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,300
is our follow the actor case study uh

174
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,880
we've got Alpha Bay and Hydra darknet

175
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,520
marketplaces and the last one is

176
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,639
actually from the second case study uh

177
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,259
which you know for those interested can

178
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,180
read in the pdf version of this talk

179
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,880
that was shared with Sans

180
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,100
um but it's essentially the people or

181
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,900
the Persona tied to one of the people

182
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,960
who laundered billions of dollars from

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,160
the original bitfinex hack back in 2016.

184
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,740
and then last but not least this is more

185
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,840
of a disclaimer just because some of

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,400
these are still considered active

187
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,319
investigations I have to throw out there

188
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,120
that you know everyone should be viewed

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,639
as innocent until proven guilty

190
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,699
which brings us to our what

191
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,160
um so you know from a what uh who what

192
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,919
when where why what uh this is uh you

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,720
know what kind of criminal activity will

194
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,120
we be investigating so you know looking

195
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,340
at the topologies listed here you know

196
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,860
on this slide our scope for this talk

197
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,680
will be focused more on uh you know

198
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,340
ransomware uh money laundering and then

199
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,860
you know the more broadly covered cyber

200
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,960
crime as a service and dark net markets

201
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,880
uh which kind of fall under multiple

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,039
criminal categories based on all the

203
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,060
different things that they touch

204
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,360
which brings us to the win of uh

205
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
criminal operations and this is really

206
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,800
more so you know just a timeline of

207
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,199
events that can help paint a picture uh

208
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,880
of a cyber criminal group's progression

209
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,860
over time and you know for those of you

210
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,599
with you know strong forensic

211
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,819
backgrounds you probably know what a

212
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,919
super timeline is and you know why

213
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,080
things like temporal analysis are so

214
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,060
important in investigations you know

215
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,319
this is just kind of a different way

216
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,419
that we can look at evidence to help

217
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,699
better understand our adversary and I

218
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,139
you know I think this is kind of a

219
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,660
decent generalized example as to why

220
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,340
it's important to track criminal

221
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,199
progression over time and the different

222
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,419
assumptions that can be made by you know

223
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:31,219
looking at our data from this viewpoint

224
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,080
which uh you know brings us to the where

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,059
of criminal operations which you know

226
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,520
obviously is focused on the areas that

227
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,740
the criminals operate out of and you

228
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,080
know I included the popular well-known

229
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,240
internet Iceberg image you know on the

230
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,519
left there uh you know which is not to

231
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,200
say that criminals only operate on

232
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,480
different dark Nets or the Deep Web and

233
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
really the point that I want to drive

234
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,540
home from this slide is that you know

235
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,580
the Cyber criminal underground exists on

236
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,920
all three levels you know I can spend 20

237
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,560
minutes on Facebook and and Twitter and

238
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll uncover some kind of criminal

239
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,459
activity you know it's not all done you

240
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:08,820
know on tour or you know other dark Nets

241
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,380
and and you know different Deep Web

242
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,200
locations so you know just because uh

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
this slide includes you know some of the

244
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,620
different services and locations that

245
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,200
are often used and abused by criminals

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,540
you know it really doesn't mean that

247
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,360
this is the you know Soul Hub of

248
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,760
criminal operations we see criminal

249
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,519
activity you know everywhere on on the

250
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,260
clarinet the Deep Web and the dark web

251
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,260
which brings us to our why you know uh

252
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,060
why do cyber criminals do what they do

253
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,339
you know nine times out of ten you know

254
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,480
these criminals are financially

255
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,040
motivated meaning you know everything

256
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,540
that they do is for the purpose of

257
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,100
making money

258
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,540
um you know that's really what drives

259
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,459
the criminal activity

260
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,140
um you know and as we can see here you

261
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,000
know the type of threat actors were

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,580
primarily focused on investigating and

263
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,740
this presentation you know the the

264
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,680
financially motivated cyber criminals

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
um however you know one of the things

266
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
that I want to point out one of the

267
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
things that we look at in the cyber

268
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,880
crime intelligence course is activity on

269
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,279
the blockchain you know tracing cyber

270
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,560
criminal activity on the blockchain we

271
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,300
start to see that these lines become

272
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,940
very blurry uh you know in that you see

273
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,680
criminals directly and indirectly

274
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,540
transacting with all of these other

275
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,060
types of threat actors so you know just

276
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,018
wanted to point that out

277
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,339
um and lastly we've got the how of cyber

278
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,200
criminal operations you know how do they

279
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
do what they do uh you know there's this

280
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,880
kind of whole cyber criminal ecosystem

281
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,100
that exists and you know these organized

282
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,720
criminal groups you know continue to get

283
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,640
more sophisticated as that ecosystem

284
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,920
grows you know making it easier for

285
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
criminals to achieve their objectives

286
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,700
and also you know lowering the barriers

287
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,320
to entry for Less sophisticated

288
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,940
criminals you know also with

289
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,680
Technologies such as you know

290
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,480
cryptocurrencies paired with things like

291
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,180
ransomware as a service or uh Dark Net

292
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,279
markets it's uh really just allowed

293
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,260
criminals to find ways to scale their

294
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,300
operations like they've never you know

295
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,459
been able to before you know really to

296
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,320
the point where we're seeing more and

297
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
more billion dollar cyber criminal

298
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,339
operations uh you know which I think is

299
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,800
a perfect segue to the you know okay

300
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
well how do we keep up with all this how

301
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
can we keep up with this entire

302
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,480
ecosystem

303
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,279
um you know well if we just focus on

304
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,980
these two overarching areas within the

305
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,320
the ecosystems hierarchy their their

306
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,540
financial operations and their criminal

307
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,339
operations you know then the rest

308
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,279
becomes much easier to track you know so

309
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,980
uh how do we effectively track these

310
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,800
these two areas uh of criminal

311
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,480
operations

312
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,040
um you know which brings me to you know

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,380
the tools that we can use to effectively

314
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,420
combat and track you know cyber criminal

315
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,420
operations and you know with a

316
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,720
combination of you know ocean uh human

317
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,240
Financial intelligence and then

318
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
forensics and and cyber threat

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,200
intelligence it becomes much easier to

320
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,060
track criminal operations you know

321
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,579
instead of encouraging Silo mentality

322
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,680
let's try and break down walls and work

323
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,540
together through things like information

324
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,019
sharing or maybe we encourage more defer

325
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,120
professionals to better understand the

326
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,980
way of financial crimes investigations

327
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,660
and those you know who perform

328
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,760
blockchain analysis to better understand

329
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
forensics and intelligence

330
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,660
um you know if cyber criminals know how

331
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,519
to do the intrusion they know how to do

332
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,800
The Ransom and they know how to launder

333
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,700
Bitcoin uh through their exchanges that

334
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,260
they make from each victim then we

335
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,420
should know how to analyze an intrusion

336
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,880
and Trace the laundered funds to The

337
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,100
Exchange to better defeat them

338
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,779
um you know and since we are limited in

339
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,959
time the uh the next kind of handful of

340
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,120
slides I'm going to just focus on two

341
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,339
intelligence disciplines that are less

342
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,380
discussed and taught within the cyber

343
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,880
security Community

344
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,100
um and those include humans or human

345
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,800
intelligence and finite also known as

346
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,260
Financial intelligence and really how we

347
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,180
can use these two uh to better

348
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,959
understand our criminal adversaries so

349
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,540
you know for starters we've got uh human

350
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,459
intelligence collection which is

351
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,620
obviously focused on the collection of

352
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,440
intelligence from Human sources uh you

353
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,000
know which can come in the form of

354
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,100
active engagements with actual cyber

355
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,899
criminals you know we can elicit

356
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,880
information about the adversary to learn

357
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,279
about their ttps and then provide you

358
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,899
know actionable intelligence to inform

359
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,060
the Defenders to better protect from

360
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,740
these threats as well as you know

361
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,959
provide law enforcement evidence to

362
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,540
support a criminal investigation

363
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,279
um you know but before we can even start

364
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,620
actively engaging we need to look at

365
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,360
some of the legal considerations of

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,940
doing this and obviously there's other

367
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,260
considerations are going to be

368
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,360
determined based on wherever it is that

369
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
you're geo-located but really is a good

370
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,260
starting point you can reference the

371
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,200
doj's documentation on legal

372
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,639
considerations when Gathering

373
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,279
intelligence from illicit sources online

374
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,980
and just as like an added layer of

375
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,440
protection you'll probably also want to

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,360
get the okay from your legal department

377
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,180
and I highly encourage to you know keep

378
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,920
your law enforcement Partners in the

379
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,959
loop every step of the way

380
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,940
um you know and once you know you you're

381
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,740
given that okay and you've got something

382
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,720
maybe in writing

383
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,579
um you know then at that point in time

384
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,519
we can start looking at doing uh actual

385
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,100
human thing and uh you know you need to

386
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,620
do everything with opsec in mind or

387
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,899
operational security uh to make sure

388
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,279
that your sock puppet account never

389
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,680
links back to you

390
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,779
so now you know we're going to look at

391
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,120
some very basic human intelligence

392
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,740
approaches that can be used in the

393
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,600
virtual environment

394
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,220
um you know so some of the more common

395
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,139
terms that you're probably already

396
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:44,940
familiar with are things like social

397
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,040
engineering sock puppet accounts and

398
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,620
elicitations you know we as intelligence

399
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,660
collectors can use these sock puppet

400
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,760
accounts with our which is our

401
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
essentially our fake identities in the

402
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,100
Cyber underground to social engineer and

403
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,800
elicit information from criminals

404
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,420
um but to get a little bit granular into

405
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,040
some of the different approaches that we

406
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
can take to do this we've got things

407
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,899
like you know the direct approach uh you

408
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,180
know this can be as simple as asking a

409
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,339
criminal what their Bitcoin address you

410
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,440
know uh you know what what is your

411
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,000
Bitcoin address you know the objective

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
of The Collector was to get the Bitcoin

413
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,620
address and so you directly ask the

414
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,660
source for this information there is no

415
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,639
deception or manipulation used it was

416
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,860
just you know uh right to the point and

417
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,300
direct

418
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,459
um then we've got our first two

419
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,459
deceptive approaches uh you know which

420
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,839
is you know like the we know all

421
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,360
approach uh and the we know nothing

422
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,880
approach uh that we know all approach is

423
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,500
kind of uh you know about making a

424
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,180
criminal Source think that you already

425
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,279
know the intricate details of something

426
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,380
so they feel more comfortable talking

427
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,600
about and revealing those details to you

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,579
uh you essentially just give them a

429
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,380
little bit to make them think that you

430
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,699
already know the information that

431
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,260
they're providing

432
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,699
um and then the we know nothing approach

433
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,740
is essentially the opposite of that this

434
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,660
approach plays on the personality types

435
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,880
that like to teach so if you have

436
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,980
someone who likes to share their methods

437
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,740
for how they breach networks uh you know

438
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,480
then the we know nothing approach would

439
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
be perfect for that person

440
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
um then we have the change of scenery

441
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,540
approach uh which you know in the

442
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,940
virtual environment uh is obviously not

443
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,459
going to a beach uh what what this looks

444
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:25,440
like in in the virtual environment is

445
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
you know wherever your source is most

446
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,220
comfortable to reveal more information

447
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,000
to you so are they more comfortable in a

448
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,339
forum private message like exploit or

449
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,100
xss or breached or are they more you

450
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,500
know comfortable talking over jabber

451
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,139
OTR because it's uh encrypted and there

452
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,199
aren't any logs tied to the conversation

453
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,480
um we've got pride and ego up approach

454
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
pride and you go down approach uh you

455
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,279
know this is as simple as building your

456
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,440
Source up or tearing them down you know

457
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,180
your sources personality will really

458
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,759
determine which of these is best in most

459
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,980
cases it'll be a peony up however you

460
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,959
know sometimes if you tear them down it

461
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,339
can make them want to reveal more

462
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,799
information to want to try and impress

463
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,179
you

464
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:11,040
um we've got the mirroring approach

465
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,380
which you know helps make the source see

466
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,140
you as someone who is you know just like

467
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,179
them essentially

468
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,579
um the emotional hate and emotional love

469
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,919
approaches uh these are you know taking

470
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,839
the fact that you know what they love

471
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,939
and what they hate and then you can use

472
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:28,559
your sock puppet to mirror these things

473
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,299
so they think again you're just like

474
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,400
them which can then make them you know

475
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,140
more comfortable to reveal things to you

476
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,900
you've got the incentive approach which

477
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,000
is pretty self-explanatory it's usually

478
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,240
tied to monetary gain then you've got

479
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,220
the mutton Jeff approach which is also

480
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,679
known as good cop and bad cop and in the

481
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,240
physical environment you know the ideas

482
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,000
you've got uh two people you know one is

483
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,740
being friendly you're good cop to the

484
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,600
source and then the other is being mean

485
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,240
to the source which is your bad cop uh

486
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,679
you know the goal is to get the source

487
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,120
to feel more comfortable revealing

488
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,059
information to the good cop so the fun

489
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,799
thing about the virtual environment is

490
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,419
that you can use two sock puppet

491
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,860
accounts that are controlled by the same

492
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,280
person to use this approach uh now again

493
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,679
these are just very basic uh human

494
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,960
intelligence approaches

495
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,059
um you know but if you are interested in

496
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,620
learning more about you know those

497
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,600
beginner level human approaches you can

498
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,179
go to this image that I hyperlinked in

499
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,760
the PDF

500
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
also just note that our course that

501
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,640
we're going to be teaching is going to

502
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,380
be covering some of the more advanced

503
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,240
techniques obviously we'll touch on the

504
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,679
beginner level ones but we're going to

505
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,919
be touching on Advanced ones as well but

506
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,059
you know really one of the biggest

507
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,059
takeaways uh from the slide is that you

508
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,679
know we have to understand that you know

509
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,780
each person is different and with that

510
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,940
not every approach is going to fit for

511
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,100
that person that you're talking to you

512
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,679
have to understand who your source is uh

513
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,940
you know that you're trying to elicit

514
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,100
information from and gauge the timing

515
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,559
based on how the conversation's going to

516
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,660
then use a particular Approach at a

517
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,760
particular time

518
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,980
which you know brings us to financial

519
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,700
intelligence

520
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,419
so this is just a uh you know a very

521
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,460
simple way of showing you know how

522
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,220
criminals try to obfuscate their source

523
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
of funds before cashing out on the

524
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,460
blockchain

525
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,919
um so you know in our first example

526
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,100
we've got uh oops

527
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,919
we've got crypto mixers uh you know

528
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,720
different crypto mixing Services which

529
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,820
you know mixing uh is also known as

530
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,000
tumbling it's a way for uh criminals to

531
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
uh mix their funds with clean funds from

532
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
other people you know making the illicit

533
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,200
transactions harder to trace back to the

534
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,660
specific owners and accounts uh you know

535
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,640
and a reason why a criminal might use uh

536
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,440
you know a service such as you know a

537
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,200
crypto mixing Service uh leads me to the

538
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,059
next example such as dark net

539
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,799
marketplaces

540
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,000
um you know if you don't know how a dark

541
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
net Marketplace Works um you know you've

542
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,000
got a buyer who you know will it wants

543
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,440
to buy something so they fund their

544
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,880
account with cryptocurrencies like

545
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,640
Bitcoin uh the buyer then you know buys

546
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,020
something that they want from the market

547
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,539
it could be drugs or a database of

548
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:14,760
credentials or whatever the you know the

549
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,340
the funds are then held in escrow until

550
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,080
the buyers confirm that they receive

551
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,240
their goods uh then the money in escrow

552
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,000
is transferred to your vendor and

553
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,740
depending on the marketplace there could

554
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,679
be a a built-in mixing service or you

555
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,419
know the vendor may want to use like

556
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,520
another mixing service to help obfuscate

557
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,320
their funds so the vendor would send

558
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,179
their Bitcoin to a crypto mixer such as

559
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:39,000
like Wasabi or you know one that was you

560
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,559
know in the news recently

561
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,720
um I think it was last week is the

562
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,360
sanctioned tornado cash mixer

563
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,220
um but then you know all that to say the

564
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,840
funds are pulled together mixed together

565
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,960
and and then sent back to the vendor

566
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,700
um so that the vendor can get to that

567
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
you know end goal of uh sending the

568
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,039
funds you know uh that that are not

569
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,740
linked to Crime to The Exchange and then

570
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,840
cashing out their funds

571
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,440
um

572
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,440
so you know one of the things that we

573
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,900
can take away as far as like you know at

574
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,220
a high level from a financial

575
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,960
intelligence perspective looking at

576
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,780
things like blockchain analytics is you

577
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,880
know we can take away that like the the

578
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,460
we know that the two most popular

579
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,620
marketplaces from a volume standpoint

580
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,260
money coming in money going out of all

581
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,960
time were Alpha Bay market and Hydra

582
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Market uh we also know you know at this

583
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,640
point in time the two most popular

584
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,919
mixing Services used by criminals happen

585
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,799
to be Wasabi and Chip mixer uh and the

586
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,900
most popular among ransomware groups is

587
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,179
by far Wasabi

588
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:43,860
um and you know we're able to kind of

589
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,780
make these observations based off of

590
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,639
again what we see on the blockchain

591
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,280
now um this is more so just to give

592
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,200
everybody an idea for those who don't

593
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,640
know what a ransomware is a service

594
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,919
business model looks like in preparation

595
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:00,600
for the next few slides which are going

596
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,820
to cover wizard spider

597
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,520
um but uh essentially the ransomware

598
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,380
developers create a ransomware they

599
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,299
lease the the ransomware to Affiliates

600
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,520
uh which you know these groups you know

601
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,500
or actors may have nothing else in

602
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,360
common with each other other than the

603
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
fact that they lease the same ransomware

604
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,500
um you know the Affiliates then use the

605
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,419
ransomware to Ransom victims the victims

606
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,220
paying cryptocurrency the money's been

607
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,840
split between the Affiliates and the

608
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,480
developer which is usually like on a 70

609
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,240
30 split uh on average I've seen other

610
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,280
variations of that but it's typically 70

611
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,159
30. uh but you know the question that I

612
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:36,960
I really want to be able to answer is

613
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
you know what do these transactions look

614
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,260
like on the blockchain and what kind of

615
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,900
you know assumptions can we make from uh

616
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,299
all of that type of data which brings us

617
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,539
to uh this slide and and for you know

618
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,240
many of you who work in intelligence or

619
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,460
forensics you probably aren't surprised

620
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,440
that the biggest contributor of funds to

621
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,440
this group belong to Conti

622
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,059
um you know but the pieces that you know

623
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,340
maybe new information are you know some

624
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,020
of the other services that this group

625
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,820
uses you know we can see that the group

626
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,059
uses sanctioned exchanges such as suex

627
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,039
and guarantech to cash out their funds

628
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,100
uh we also see that they use two mixing

629
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,780
services that I pointed out on the

630
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,480
previous slide uh and then we also see

631
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,240
that uh the two ransomware strains that

632
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,679
this group received the most total

633
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:26,640
volume from and funds uh is uh conti and

634
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,260
ryuk and

635
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,900
um you know for those of you uh who are

636
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
familiar with this criminal group you're

637
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,440
probably not surprised by the conti and

638
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,900
Riot connection but you probably are con

639
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,820
uh a little bit surprised about the bit

640
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,400
payment connection

641
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,799
foreign

642
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,360
so you know on this slide I just want to

643
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,520
take a quick detour to explain some of

644
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,740
the things that we gained insight into

645
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,020
from the Conti leaks since we are on the

646
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,059
subject of Conti ransomware

647
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,320
um if you don't know what the Conti

648
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,299
leaks are you know this slide will kind

649
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,860
of give you a crash course on what

650
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,919
happened so you know for starters uh you

651
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,200
know Conti they used a data extortion

652
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,500
site known as Conti news to leak victims

653
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,419
data as a way to add additional pressure

654
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,299
for their victims to pay uh following

655
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,720
Russia's Invasion Invasion into Ukraine

656
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,659
uh members of Conti decided to make a

657
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,299
statement on the Conti news site that uh

658
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:22,620
claimed that you know they would

659
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,020
retaliate against the West if there was

660
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,360
any targeting of Russia and cyberspace

661
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,539
uh so what this led to was a pro-ukraine

662
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,760
Conti member who kind of went rogue and

663
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,280
started leaking sensitive data from uh

664
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,620
Conti servers such as chat logs and

665
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,020
details of you know who members are of

666
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,900
Conti uh in real life and you know as

667
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,480
you can see right here they doxed an

668
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,000
individual named Sergey which um you

669
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,100
know taking all of this information and

670
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,860
pivoting off of it you get to you know

671
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,960
what this person or who this person is

672
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,700
in real life

673
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,679
um you know you take their email address

674
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,720
their name and and you know you search

675
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,360
in a bunch of other uh accounts uh

676
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,340
you're able to identify who this person

677
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,900
is

678
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,400
um another thing that we learned from

679
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
Conti leaks are you know the

680
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
organizational hierarchy of the criminal

681
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,179
group you know we learned uh you know uh

682
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:17,400
it was kind of being operated similar to

683
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,080
how many you know Fortune 500

684
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,720
Enterprises operate on you know in most

685
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,280
cases

686
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,740
um we also learned that you know at the

687
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,740
head of all of this is the threat actor

688
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,620
who goes by the name Stern uh or the the

689
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,480
pseudonym Stern

690
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,279
um and what we can see you know sort of

691
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,380
on the next slide is some of those

692
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,940
connections that we can make between

693
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,640
these three ransomware strains on the

694
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,059
blockchain

695
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,460
so you know on the left we can see that

696
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,140
the Rio ransomware extortion

697
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,480
cryptocurrency addresses submitted funds

698
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,580
to a cryptocurrency address owned by

699
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,700
Stern and all of these Conti ransomware

700
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,919
addresses on the right also sent funds

701
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,020
to the same cryptocurrency address that

702
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,840
was controlled by Stern uh we all we

703
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,659
also can see Stern uh sending funds to

704
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,240
an address that was attributed to Mango

705
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,820
which is another member of the Conti

706
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,380
ransomware group that was revealed in

707
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,120
the Conti leaks

708
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,700
um also what we can see here is we see a

709
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,100
Conti ransomware address sending funds

710
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,220
to uh multiple cryptocurrency addresses

711
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,080
that are attributed to caricurt

712
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,419
ransomware you know which is uh you know

713
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,100
for those of you familiar with carricker

714
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,620
is likely the successor of Conti based

715
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,919
on timing and many other connections we

716
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:37,380
can also see here vice versa we see Cara

717
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,419
Kurt ransomware address sending funds to

718
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,140
akanti attributed address but really you

719
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,220
know one of the things that I just

720
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,020
wanted people to take away from the last

721
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,659
couple slides is just to show that we

722
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,400
can make very similar connections

723
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,500
through visibility into criminals

724
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,659
Financial operations as we can through

725
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,240
things like intrusion analysis and

726
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,340
tracking criminal operations in the

727
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,159
Cyber underground and really it provides

728
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,140
a more in-depth look at the why and the

729
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,779
how of criminal operations and we've got

730
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,700
more visibility into the criminal

731
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,820
ecosystem through this lens and the

732
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,559
infrastructure that they use that that

733
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,380
we can really tailor uh to a particular

734
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,480
group or a particular Marketplace so

735
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,279
long as we have those cryptocurrency

736
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,380
addresses that are attributed to that

737
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,799
activity

738
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,260
and that brings us to our follow the

739
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,000
actor case study

740
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,799
um so as a starting point we need to

741
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,179
essentially look for attributable

742
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,340
indicators and behaviors such as

743
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,299
personas and email addresses or uh you

744
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:40,980
know the behaviors like stalometry

745
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,020
findings which you know for those

746
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,700
unfamiliar with stalometry that's

747
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,500
looking at the patterns and how that

748
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,260
person talks uh you know all of this you

749
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,179
know collection with the goal of leading

750
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,880
us to uh who a suspect is in real life

751
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,580
that controls those accounts so for this

752
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,260
case study we'll be looking at

753
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,380
nosopheros and you know sort of sticking

754
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,080
with our movie theme we'll be supporting

755
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,340
uh operation The Hunt for Red October

756
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,380
um and to give you kind of this tldr

757
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,720
version of nosopheros they're the

758
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,320
Persona that developed uh the Thanos

759
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,419
ransomware and jigsaw version 2

760
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,140
ransomware

761
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,159
so we can't talk about you know so furos

762
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,980
without first you know looking at the

763
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,860
leak of the original uh jigsaw

764
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,200
ransomware source code

765
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,460
um so on January 2019 uh we see that on

766
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,039
the Underground form cracked uh this

767
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,080
forum user leaked the source code of the

768
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,659
original jigsaw ransomware

769
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:48,000
um so later I want to say three four

770
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,320
months later uh yeah in April 2019 uh

771
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
we've got a user that goes by Plus

772
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
escalapius on the same forum who

773
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,400
responds to the thread

774
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,279
um you know stating that the reason why

775
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,020
the ransomware no longer worked was

776
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,980
because the blocker uh API was no longer

777
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,279
available

778
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,460
now about two weeks later on a separate

779
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,860
criminal Forum uh known as hack forums

780
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,880
there was a post created by a nosopheros

781
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,399
that advertised the jigsaw ransomware

782
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,380
version 2 and they also give away their

783
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,179
email address which is a Gmail address

784
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,140
that GSM box updates at gmail

785
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,720
um and you know that so we know that

786
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,299
that Gmail account is linked to the

787
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:42,299
nosopheros Persona they also made a

788
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,120
comment right there uh that jigsaw

789
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,740
version one became obsolete because

790
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,100
blocker i o API is no longer available

791
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,260
uh it's kind of a loose stylometry

792
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,140
finding or connection between asclepius

793
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,360
and nosopheros but you know we're we're

794
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,179
not done yet this is just the beginning

795
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,520
um so about a week before the post on

796
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,520
hack forums by nosoferos there was a

797
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,740
post by asclepius and another criminal

798
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,799
Forum known as nold where asclepius

799
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,500
advertised the jigsaw ransomware version

800
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,380
two to 2019 where we see another

801
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,779
Telemetry connection between nosopheros

802
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,200
in both the title as well as the body of

803
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,539
the thread where we see about 80 percent

804
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,539
of the post is verbatim What nosophers

805
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:30,600
posted in their thread on hack forums

806
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,820
um and finally I just want to call out

807
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,940
this part right here uh this Plus in

808
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,980
front of asclepius is something to

809
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,539
remember for the end of the case study

810
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,559
it's going to be important

811
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,000
and you know I know things are looking a

812
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,279
little bit all over the place uh we've

813
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
got kind of lines across all of these

814
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,539
slides but I promise if you just stick

815
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,460
with me to the end this is going to make

816
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,899
sense uh fairly soon

817
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,539
so you know in a later Post in July 2019

818
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,500
we see Escapist post on nold form where

819
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,840
they advertise a private banking Trojan

820
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,820
source code but you know we also see

821
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,220
that in this post they reveal their

822
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,640
shoppie page uh they reveal a WhatsApp a

823
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,460
telegram uh in in the telegram and the

824
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,500
WhatsApp have the same phone number but

825
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,419
then they also reveal a PayPal and a

826
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:25,919
Gmail account and that Gmail account

827
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,740
looks very familiar

828
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,720
um so you know taking a step back and

829
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,340
kind of looking at everything that we've

830
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,580
collected so far you know let's just

831
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,260
kind of put it all right there on the

832
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,700
board

833
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,840
um you know we can see that uh you know

834
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,480
we've got asclepius is connected to no

835
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,600
so for us through the GSM box updates at

836
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,279
gmail.com

837
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,200
um the other interesting connection is

838
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,960
if you look it up asclepius is the Greek

839
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
God of medicine and nosopheros means

840
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,059
disease bearing in Greek so there's some

841
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,679
kind of a medical reference connection

842
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,399
between these these personas as well and

843
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,260
then through Telemetry connections such

844
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,659
as the jigsaw Ransom version 2 thread

845
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,659
and the comments around the blocker dot

846
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,020
IO API we could probably say with medium

847
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,700
to high confidence that these personas

848
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,000
are operated by the same person

849
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,120
and this is uh you know down here is

850
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,820
actually just something around this same

851
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,620
time there was a German cyber security

852
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,980
firm that posted on Twitter uh that you

853
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,640
know they found a name uh in the jigsaw

854
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,880
ransomware file path so uh that's you

855
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,559
know an interesting finding at this time

856
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,779
but we'll just take note of that and

857
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,600
remember that in a later slide

858
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,659
so looking at some nosofros posts on

859
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,820
hack forums that were you know posted

860
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,919
around the same time we can see that

861
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,020
from a tooling preference perspective

862
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,840
that nosophers loves Quasar rat they

863
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,460
also mentioned some of the ones that

864
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,140
they don't like but really harp on the

865
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,720
fact that they love Quasar uh we also

866
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,659
can see that they like to sign BR period

867
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:08,760
at the end of a lot of their posts which

868
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,500
is you know kind of a new stilometry

869
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,059
finding

870
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,460
um also we know from May 2019 to early

871
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,880
November 2019 that nosofrus went dark

872
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,279
and didn't post anything on any forums

873
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,580
but around that same time uh income

874
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,279
silver crypter uh who advertise their

875
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,320
crypto on hack forums who just so

876
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,059
happens to uh love quasarat they also

877
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,799
reveal their jabber ID which includes

878
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,200
the name no so faros and then they also

879
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,600
sign at the end of their posts with a br

880
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,340
period

881
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,440
um also in that same silver crypto

882
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,140
thread they post examples of of their

883
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,080
their product the crypter uh working and

884
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,240
how it works and include you know

885
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,000
another no so for us jabber ID

886
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,700
um and then also and asclepius jabber ID

887
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,679
which you know just adds additional

888
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,720
confirmation that these personas are all

889
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,080
linked

890
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,039
um also around the same time we see

891
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,980
asclepius posting on an old Forum uh

892
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,300
they were advertising a private

893
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,520
ransomware Builder which we later find

894
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,639
out is Thanos uh and you know in that

895
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,859
thread they list out the uh the same

896
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:19,859
shoppie page Discord server and jabber

897
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:21,899
ID that silver Cryptor shared and their

898
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:24,300
thread on hack forums which uh you know

899
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,060
connects uh asclepius and silver crypto

900
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,619
together

901
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:30,960
um also you know just to add one of the

902
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,540
earlier personas also tied to these

903
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,199
group these actors or personas is uh uh

904
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,119
the uh Nebuchadnezzar and and

905
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,639
Nebuchadnezzar is

906
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,460
um they essentially link themselves to

907
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,639
these uh other personas through uh

908
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,859
virtual humans uh engagements where

909
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,320
Nebuchadnezzar stated that they were no

910
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,418
so faros and then the connection between

911
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:58,800
silver Cryptor and asclepius is through

912
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,000
um uh stylometry findings so uh similar

913
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,660
uh signing like BR period and uh very

914
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,359
similar titles and how they use brackets

915
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,259
and things like that

916
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,280
um also when we get into the Discord

917
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,440
server we can see that there's a new

918
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,320
persona that goes by the name Thanatos

919
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,720
which is another Greek reference and

920
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,700
this is the private Discord that

921
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,880
escalatius advertised and silver Cryptor

922
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,460
advertised but I was really used for the

923
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,200
purpose of helping customers of the

924
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,040
Thanos ransomware uh Builder and you

925
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,619
know as you can see here

926
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,619
uh Thanatos uh just so happens to use

927
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,240
the exact same profile photo as

928
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,779
asclepius

929
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,640
so you know it's been a while and you

930
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,859
know nosopheros has been dark for a

931
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,260
while so you know we're we're looking at

932
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,460
Mid November 2019 and no Sophos is back

933
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,960
um you know they're applying to the

934
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,180
underground Forum crit BB and post an

935
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,520
introduction thread to see if they'll be

936
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,560
accepted into the forum

937
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,060
um you know when asked about what

938
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,740
products they're planning on offering

939
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,420
they say that they'll be offering a

940
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,640
private crypter which is you know

941
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640
probably a reference to Silver crypter

942
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,619
and they also mentioned a private

943
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,020
ransomware Builder which is likely the

944
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,480
Thanos ransomware Builder

945
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,400
um when asked about their skills they

946
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
list it that they use a you know a bunch

947
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,660
of languages for programming malware

948
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,660
that all kind of sound uh familiar in

949
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,740
that

950
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,780
um you know these are all languages that

951
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,940
asclepius and some of the other personas

952
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
we've tracked uh use for the malware

953
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,920
that they create and advertise

954
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,859
um this other part here have you sold

955
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,140
your product on any other Market no

956
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,740
sofro says that uh they've sold their

957
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,720
product on nold forum and on their

958
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,339
private Discord server which is

959
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,920
interesting because nosopheros is an on

960
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,560
nold and uh they don't have a private

961
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,079
Discord server but Thanatos does and

962
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,420
asclepius is on an old

963
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,079
um

964
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,680
and then lastly uh you know this will be

965
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
more important towards the end the the

966
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,040
thing that I just want you to remember

967
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,460
here is that this that nosofaros

968
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,440
mentions that you know they've got good

969
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,060
training and cracking but they don't

970
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,140
really do it as much anymore

971
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:27,060
now if this was like a movie

972
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,000
um you know Johnny Depp blow or

973
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,220
um you know Nicholas Cage and Lord of

974
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,619
War uh you know this would be the part

975
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,540
of the movie where everything's going

976
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,839
you know fantastic for the criminal uh

977
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,119
you know there's rock music going on in

978
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,280
the background they're driving a jet ski

979
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,740
or uh you know just seems like you know

980
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,420
nothing's gonna stop them they're just

981
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,820
doing you know gangbusters uh with

982
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,619
everything that they're doing and what

983
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,420
this kind of looked like in the Cyber

984
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,040
underground is that you know you start

985
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,520
seeing uh Mass adoption of the Thanos

986
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,320
ransomware within you know some of the

987
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,180
more top tier underground forums like

988
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,240
xss and exploit uh we also see that no

989
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,040
Sophos is getting vouches from

990
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,320
well-known cyber criminals and their you

991
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,579
know their credibility is just really

992
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,260
shooting through the roof among you know

993
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,240
the criminal Community

994
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,980
um you know they're posting often in

995
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,839
these two forums

996
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,280
um and really because of the mass

997
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
popularity and credibility I'm among

998
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,960
these criminals nosophers decides to

999
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,579
start their own ransomware as a service

1000
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:27,740
program

1001
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,660
also just a quick note that at the

1002
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,060
bottom right there uh you'll see that

1003
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,400
nosopheros provides additional evidence

1004
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,380
that escalapias and nosopheros are

1005
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,380
linked by posting contact information

1006
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,960
for asclepius and nosopheros jabber IDs

1007
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,300
um also you know around this same time

1008
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,339
you know again you know touching on that

1009
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,280
you know movie reference uh you know we

1010
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,380
see this sort of explosion of adoption

1011
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,839
of Thanos ransomware with different

1012
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,359
nation-state apt groups using Thanos in

1013
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:03,119
their campaigns to different spin-off

1014
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,400
variants of Thanos like the hack bit

1015
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
ransomware

1016
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,599
so you know it's kind of time to take

1017
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,760
things a bit more seriously and and you

1018
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,380
know try and drill down on everything

1019
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,240
that we've collected so far on this

1020
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,339
actor and maybe we can try you know

1021
00:39:17,339 --> 00:39:19,320
mapping it to the diamond model just for

1022
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,640
fun

1023
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
um so you know on the adversary side

1024
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,720
we've got you know all these personas

1025
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,020
that we've linked so far

1026
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,880
um on the capability side we've got all

1027
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,440
the different tools that you know

1028
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,359
they've either developed or you know the

1029
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,680
tools that they prefer to use

1030
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,079
and then over on the infrastructure side

1031
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,640
which you know I think is the most

1032
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,140
important side from an attribution

1033
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,760
standpoint

1034
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,680
um it we have things like you know their

1035
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,079
PayPal and shoppie details uh we've got

1036
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,760
some Bitcoin and Monero cryptocurrency

1037
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,859
addresses tied to the these these

1038
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:55,380
personas uh we've got WhatsApp and

1039
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,119
telegram accounts linked to the same

1040
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,660
phone number uh we've got jabber IDs

1041
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,020
we've got a Discord server uh protonmail

1042
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,140
Gmail addresses uh as well as all the

1043
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,760
different you know criminal forums that

1044
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,380
they operate out of

1045
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,820
um and then lastly on the victim side

1046
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,500
we've got just some regions that have

1047
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
been impacted by Thanos and jigsaw

1048
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,240
ransomware

1049
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,160
so you know now we've got all that

1050
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,720
information that we've collected let's

1051
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,880
kind of do a deep dive into you know

1052
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,040
what evidence is the most important you

1053
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,720
know we've gone down enough rabbit holes

1054
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,280
let's try and find evidence that is

1055
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,140
going to lead us to the person behind

1056
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,640
the keyboard

1057
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,380
um so if you remember uh and that

1058
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,500
shouldn't say 2016 it should say 2019

1059
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,780
um but there's a an asclepius

1060
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,180
advertisement for a private banking

1061
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,540
Trojan on uh The nold Forum which gave

1062
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,640
us you know those shoppie details the

1063
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,640
GSM box updates Gmail and a PayPal

1064
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,000
account now we later find out that this

1065
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,760
shoppie page was registered with that

1066
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,859
same Gmail

1067
00:40:57,859 --> 00:41:01,079
and that email address is tied to that

1068
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:02,700
PayPal

1069
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,380
um okay cool

1070
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,599
um not surprising but we also find out

1071
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,420
that the PayPal was registered to a

1072
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,320
Moises zagala and that gives us a second

1073
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,040
Gmail and it gives us uh

1074
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,980
a Venezuelan physical address and a

1075
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,320
telephone number and as you can see the

1076
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,359
second Gmail account is moisesterstegal

1077
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,859
gmail.com

1078
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,800
which uh that phone number is actually

1079
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,839
the same phone number that was used by

1080
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,640
those WhatsApp and telegram accounts

1081
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,320
that are linked to the personas that

1082
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,200
we're investigating and then also just

1083
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,180
for fun if you remember from the German

1084
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,160
cyber security company post on Twitter

1085
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,320
they revealed a jigsaw ransomware file

1086
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,060
path that included the name Moises

1087
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,880
interesting connection

1088
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,680
which leads us to our question okay well

1089
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,880
who is Moises zagala

1090
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,880
now I think the biggest opsec mistake

1091
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,180
that this person ever made was back in

1092
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,000
2016 uh when they basically docks

1093
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,280
themselves stating that they Moises

1094
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,859
sigala are asclepius and as you can see

1095
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,660
there's even a picture of Moises with

1096
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,480
the Venezuelan flag next to them and you

1097
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,619
know they say that they've been

1098
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,480
participating in the high cracking

1099
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,880
University which was you know a popular

1100
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,940
hacking Collective uh back in the 90s

1101
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,520
that was created by uh this this guy

1102
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,359
named old red cracker orc for short

1103
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,980
um where you know this group would share

1104
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,540
different reverse engineering and

1105
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,460
cracking questions to its members to try

1106
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,359
to solve and if you remember from uh

1107
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,640
nosofarosa's application on uh BB

1108
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,859
they said that they had you know good

1109
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,480
training and cracking but they don't

1110
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,880
really do it as often anymore

1111
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,099
interesting because this group or the HC

1112
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,560
hcu has been around since the 90s so

1113
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,119
that kind of fits

1114
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,440
um it provides kind of additional comp

1115
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,300
information based on our suspect's

1116
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,880
profile that they are asclepius and

1117
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,740
nosopheros

1118
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,660
um also if you remember from that

1119
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,640
original jigsaw ransomware source code

1120
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,380
leaked that asclepius used the Plus

1121
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,660
escalpius instead of just asclepius in

1122
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,060
their name that plus kind of symbolizes

1123
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,640
that uh asclepius was part of the high

1124
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,240
cracking University or hcu because hcu

1125
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,579
used it as like a symbol that a user had

1126
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:20,339
solved one of those hcu riddles or

1127
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:21,260
questions

1128
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,660
also we see Moises calls out that they

1129
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,180
have shared many posts on those three

1130
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:29,760
forums in the bottom left uh you know

1131
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,160
under the the Persona plus asclepius

1132
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,299
which we can see on this next slide

1133
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,940
so you know looking at those old forums

1134
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,880
we find a lot of evidence of asclepius

1135
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,680
making kind of similar posts and

1136
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,420
contributions that date back to uh 1999

1137
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,760
um that share you know similarities in

1138
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,099
you know connections and and you know

1139
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,800
different stylometry findings that are

1140
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,280
connected to nosopherosa's Persona

1141
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,000
um

1142
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,619
you know not directly linked to

1143
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,200
nosopheros but just more evidence that

1144
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,640
ties uh those those uh personas together

1145
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,760
we can also see other contributions to

1146
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,680
hcu looking at you know old chat logs

1147
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,160
and lots of talk about uh orc and who is

1148
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,160
orc but you know we're not here to hunt

1149
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,319
for the old red cracker we're here to

1150
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,540
hunt for the person behind no so faros

1151
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,900
and escalapias and the Thanos ransomware

1152
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,700
which it's starting to look more and

1153
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,579
more like this is this Moises sagala is

1154
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,579
our Prime Suspect so you know if we dive

1155
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,160
even deeper into you know some of the

1156
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,740
personal evidence that was collected and

1157
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,140
tied to Moises like his personal Gmail

1158
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,760
account

1159
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,500
um you know we find that he sent an

1160
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,839
email to himself that included a text

1161
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,900
message exchange on WhatsApp with uh

1162
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,520
someone about the jigsaw ransomware

1163
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,099
program okay that's interesting

1164
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,560
um we can also see in a later email that

1165
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,500
Moyes is sent in email to the GSM box

1166
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,380
updates Gmail with the subject banking

1167
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,180
information and password dump report

1168
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,300
where he included two attachments with

1169
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,599
one being a file with a file path that

1170
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,900
linked to Moises to a nosophers Monero

1171
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,300
cryptocurrency wallet uh and then the

1172
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,280
second attachment which includes that

1173
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,920
phone number that ties Moises sagala to

1174
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,920
those WhatsApp and telegram accounts

1175
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,680
um and then the last email which is

1176
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,200
really just funny how damning that

1177
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,800
evidence is right there is uh one where

1178
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,099
Moises received an email to his personal

1179
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:43,800
Gmail account with the subject Thanos

1180
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,640
license where they say hi Moises I was

1181
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,839
having an issue with my private

1182
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:51,359
ransomware Builder license can you help

1183
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,160

1184
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,560
just

1185
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,319
the damning evidence right there some of

1186
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,660
the other interesting findings from this

1187
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,260
case is the medical connections you know

1188
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,300
if you look at you know back at the

1189
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,819
nosophers and asclepius both are Greek

1190
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:14,400
references to medical terms uh and

1191
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,680
Moises just so happens to be a 55 year

1192
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,500
old Venezuelan cardiologist so you know

1193
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,420
those medical references are definitely

1194
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,800
interesting

1195
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,119
um looking at this you know from an

1196
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,640
opsec standpoint I mean if you're trying

1197
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,619
to hide the fact that you're a vampire

1198
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,079
for example you know from the world

1199
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,480
would you name yourself Dracula uh you

1200
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,680
know seems like he kind of should have

1201
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,180
known better

1202
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,520
um but another interesting finding are

1203
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,660
the kyc request exchange details uh you

1204
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,579
know to that cryptocurrency exchange

1205
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,619
account that was linked to no so faros

1206
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:49,319
uh we can see that Moises was the the

1207
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,540
name tied to the account and and so was

1208
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,700
his personal email address but also we

1209
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,980
see that the exchange had a photograph

1210
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,440
in in a driver's license tied to the

1211
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,780
count which uh it happens to be that

1212
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,980
driver's license right there

1213
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,099
so you know uh obviously everybody is

1214
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:11,339
innocent until proven guilty uh but you

1215
