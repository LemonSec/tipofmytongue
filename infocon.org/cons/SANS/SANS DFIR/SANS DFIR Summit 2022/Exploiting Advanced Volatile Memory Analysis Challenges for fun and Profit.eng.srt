1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:07,980
thank you very much for coming to our

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,080
talk today here on exploding Advanced

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,540
volatile memory analysis challenges for

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,059
fun and popular

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,039
so here are some things to expect in

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,539
today's presentation

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,160
um I'll wave my hands a little bit we

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
actually have a video of a live or the

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,420
demonstration of how to utilize the tool

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,580
and then hopefully time will afford and

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,439
that I can answer some questions at the

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,140
end but just a quick disclaimer do you

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,640
use any information presented in this

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,620
presentation you know they're that of me

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,020
that'll be presenter do not represent

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,700
the views of the United States Air Force

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,100
or the department of

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,960
all right here we are um so book

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,579
reference so here are a few book

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,719
references

22
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,820
um that I built off of in order to

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,399
create this this research as well as

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,200
additional workshops I read workshops on

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,579
how to do this for free like three

26
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,320
workshops and then I points to

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,600
references so if you are interested in

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,340
exactly what I'm talking about here are

29
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,660
some of the books to get started

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,180
all right so as you heard from the bio

31
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,460
just real quick you know who am I

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,799
um in essence I love to do cyber

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,020
security and I love to help other

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,479
individuals on how do we better secure

35
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,640
our systems sometimes that will come

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,500
from a defensive tool that I'm happy to

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,360
release other times it comes from an

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,979
exploit store that I'll develop to so

39
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,960
like here's a problem and we can talk

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,939
about how do we secure this in order to

41
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,920
better defend our systems in the future

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,280
from actual malicious activities

43
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,840
okay let's get into the research

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,860
motivation

45
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,900
so the resource motivation the main

46
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,240
thesis on on what I do in my research is

47
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,860
that that kindness that malware

48
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,479
continues to increase in sophistication

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,140
and prevalence the there was a research

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,460
that was conducted by the Rand

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,460
organization here uh it was done around

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,000
2014 or 2015. and what's that research

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
identified was the average lifespan of

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,320
malware different than what our

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,420
antivirus vendors will tell us and this

56
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,159
is not a guitar Advengers our security

57
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,860
teams but they identified that the

58
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,960
majority of the zero days that was one

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,060
to zero day that existed on the machines

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,000
uh in the wild the average lifespan of

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,160
malware was actually between six and

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,340
seven years of life until it was

63
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,379
detected and then remediated from the

64
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,720
victim issue and even today we are

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,400
seeing that 80 vendors they're getting

66
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,980
very very good and identifying now with

67
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,800
but many of the results or reports that

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
I'm seeing whenever a new malware has

69
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,280
been detected that malware has been

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,739
present on that system or the network

71
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,780
for years before they've been detected

72
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,599
so clearly we do have to continue to

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,180
increase our abilities at detecting and

74
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,519
mitigating from malware types of attacks

75
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,620
and the most important thing here on

76
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,940
this slide is to understand that

77
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,739
although malware gets really good at

78
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,360
hiding itself in the operating system

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,000
and from the network malware one place

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,280
malware cannot easily hide is in memory

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,099
that at any point there should always be

82
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,680
a trace that we can see like coming this

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,300
might look notorious you know let's

84
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,040
investigate further we're still in the

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,019
rest of that malware attack

86
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,840
right let's go into the memory analysis

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
artifacts that we can expect now here I

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,000
use this to show that um there are

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
there's memory volatile memory carries

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,860
lots of artifacts if we know how to

91
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,360
extract this from the computer system

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,640
now I just like to show this as this is

93
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,519
just a few like a few artifacts that we

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,739
can bring out one I would definitely use

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,860
this memory analysis as I'm doing I'm

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,140
like reverse engineering if there are

97
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,239
tax or encrypted samples that are not

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,220
able to analyze static and my machine

99
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,739
there are times that I can just run it

100
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,599
to launch it let it execute for a while

101
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,299
and then dump it from memory in its own

102
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,819
packed unencrypted form and then it can

103
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,680
allow me to do data analysis from that

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,260
standpoint I like to use memory analysis

105
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,959
to extract the master filet paper and

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,080
lots of prefix information to that just

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
give us a wealth of forensic data of

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,280
what happened on that system when who

109
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,019
are the initiators of various attacks

110
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,060
and lots of other details here as an

111
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,159
exercise to the expert you can spend

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,480
some time looking through these and then

113
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,120
working on this on your own

114
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,099
okay let's go to the malware analysis

115
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,019
Treehouse process so I created the

116
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,060
malware analysis 2DS process or at least

117
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,699
a a pictorial representation of what I

118
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,220
always do whenever I conduct analysis on

119
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,979
various machines I see that I always or

120
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,720
you know I usually start from physical

121
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,900
memory or at least a memory image this

122
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,000
is part of our data acquisition process

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
and now as we go on our staff the data

124
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,020
conversions goes upwards we start from

125
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,419
the raw data and then we begin and we

126
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,759
utilize various aggregation routines and

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,100
extraction routines in order to pick out

128
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,040
various forms of data and then I analyze

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
those videos into respective pillars but

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,240
something I find is anytime I'm looking

131
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,800
at this analysis I always want to know

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
in general what is the status of the

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,419
system what processes are executed on

134
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,340
the computer machine what files are

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,280
present what modules might exist dlls

136
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,919
injected dlls you know legitimate dlls

137
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,840
or drivers and the system what is the

138
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,639
network activity perhaps this can lead

139
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
us towards malicious activities to turn

140
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,780
on the system or what type of caption

141
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,460
information can we expect like

142
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,520
registering information in the memory or

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,560
that masterfully those prefix data like

144
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,419
what can I bring out from the system and

145
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,400
then I go into additional analysis in

146
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
order to produce knowledge about that

147
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,419
system that knowledge allows me to

148
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,580
create a report it doesn't have to be a

149
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,800
fancy report just something to annotate

150
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,180
this is what we've learned from this

151
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,680
system in which we've gone from the

152
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,300
physical basically something that we

153
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,919
often relate to understand what's

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,660
happening on the system

155
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,479
okay here I'm just doing a quick tools

156
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,759
of the trade in our acquisition process

157
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,220
to our analysis process into our

158
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,780
reporting process there are many tools

159
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,240
that can be utilized the ones in red are

160
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,639
what we focus for This research and so

161
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,500
magnet Ram texture that's one of the

162
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,320
really well known tools that have been

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,900
quite stable in which I can launch the

164
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,000
tool to give me a dump of the memory

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,039
then I can utilize different analysis

166
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,660
routines to understand what are the

167
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,720
artifacts on the system volatility is a

168
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,139
well-known memory analysis tool and so

169
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,240
I've built the Xavier memory analysis

170
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,639
framework on top of volatility in order

171
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,979
to extract data and then I analyze it

172
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,080
and then we produce a custom report for

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
us that we can see what are the details

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,940
of this system

175
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,139
with that information let's go into a

176
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,060
challenge problem to help guide how to

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,919
utilize this tool and then what we can

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,380
use or learn from in this new Advanced

179
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,940
analysis construct

180
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,560
so allow me to introduce you to members

181
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,259
mem Labs is an educational Suite so it's

182
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,440
a capital flag exercise of six memory

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,759
images that have been dumped and

184
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,280
provided to you in order to test as well

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,840
as enhance your ability to conduct

186
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,020
memory analysis we will utilize this as

187
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,380
a foundation to learn from and then see

188
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,780
how can we enhance this analysis process

189
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,819
and so we'll get started here with memo

190
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,259
Labs version

191
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,840
um and then they handle of individual

192
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,600
who created this is stuxnet99 and so if

193
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,100
you have time please check them out he

194
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,780
has some good work out there and so

195
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,400
that's why I thought this is a great way

196
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,560
to start in our memory analysis

197
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,600
so here's the challenge problem in a

198
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,220
nutshell there is a computer your

199
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
colleagues machine or your colleague

200
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,960
sister's computer it crashed and now at

201
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
the time of the class she was working on

202
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,060
a paint program and so our role or our

203
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,919
task in this investigation is to figure

204
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,440
out what happened what programs are

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,680
unique in this computer and at the time

206
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,780
of the class and then what systems like

207
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,580
what files relate to each other that can

208
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
lead us to solving the challenge for

209
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,280
this specific type of exercise and again

210
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,220
we're using this for a Memoirs lab one

211
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,500
and at the bottom here with that

212
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,599
question mark I'm showing that you can

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,639
go directly to that to this GitHub to

214
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,319
download these memory images and then

215
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,060
conduct your own investigation and

216
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,819
follow us along with what we were doing

217
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,400
so here are some helper tasks so I

218
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,960
created these helper tasks to help guide

219
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,840
us towards this type of Challenge and so

220
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,819
overall I just want us to see how can we

221
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,039
build that tool to help with the data

222
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,900
extraction process to solve this

223
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,280
coverage so these are the main questions

224
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,740
that we'll go after WinRAR is something

225
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,419
important that I want us to find let's

226
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,220
go ahead and look into how does win Law

227
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,560
relates to this system and then down

228
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
here I'm actually telling you up front

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,240
these are two suspicious files regarding

230
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,819
this investigation

231
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,159
importing.org as well as the stage one

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,140
dot bat file so I'm telling you like hey

233
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,120
I want you to find these but how do you

234
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,219
find this efficiently and we'll in our

235
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,740
demo we'll see how we solve those solve

236
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,760
those tasks

237
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,279
so if we look at our memory analysis

238
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,519
solving this type of analysis requires a

239
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,800
lot of data and so on this side I'm just

240
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,500
trying to show that these different

241
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,720
plugins from this volatility tool can be

242
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,240
utilized or kind of consulted for

243
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,279
further analysis to figure out what's

244
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,920
happening and then solve the problem

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,440
all right but now if you've ever done

246
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,899
this before I want us really to

247
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,120
appreciate the difficulties of

248
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
conducting memory analysis at present

249
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
time

250
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,480
and so here we are the current method of

251
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,399
doing memory analysis utilizing a tool

252
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,680
like volatility are very similar it is

253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,860
highly data intensive there are lots of

254
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,019
data that's going to be extracted first

255
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,760
from the machine and then we have to

256
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,860
spend time analyzing this data one by

257
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,019
one to begin and annotate our notes to

258
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,640
figure out what happened here what

259
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,500
happened there it takes a lot of time

260
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,180
and if you've ever done this before

261
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,459
you'll you'll appreciate that this is

262
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,260
what it looks like on our side whenever

263
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,300
we're doing the analysis

264
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,040
but now I want to introduce you to my

265
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,959
man Albert Einstein so something

266
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,700
Einstein said is everything should be

267
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,399
made as simple as possible not just

268
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,980
simple and so in memory analysis I'm

269
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,839
trying to make this as simple as

270
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,760
possible in order to help us conduct

271
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,920
various analysis as well as solve

272
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,080
challenges as fast as possible so in

273
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
order to do this quickly I want to

274
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,220
introduce you to a few Concepts one of

275
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,080
them is this concept of the aggregate

276
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,019
plugin so what I do at the beginning of

277
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,880
the presentation we spoke about those

278
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,459
various pillars that I like to kind of

279
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,680
arrange my information into whenever I

280
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,420
do the set of analysis so one of this

281
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,760
aggregate plugin is a process in

282
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,040
volatility I can utilize multiple

283
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,380
plugins and then aggregate that data

284
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,380
into a single frame called process and

285
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,000
now you as the expert you should be able

286
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,980
to go to one spot and say what is the

287
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,440
information about processes on the

288
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,060
system and then all the data should be

289
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,440
there kind of important and then we can

290
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,240
enrich our analysis and that standpoint

291
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,580
we also have a concept of data

292
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,519
extraction or data cross referencing and

293
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,740
so then the data cross reference allows

294
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,100
us to see like understand the context of

295
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,440
how as an artifact utilized within this

296
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,899
memory system so it's not just a search

297
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,540
like a grip or a keyword but now I want

298
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,880
to see what processes what drivers what

299
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,040
models are utilizing this keyword and

300
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
then how does it relate to the entire

301
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,880
memory system this is an example of this

302
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,100
data process and our demo to come in

303
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,079
just a couple of minutes I actually want

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,120
to talk about a system manifest and so

305
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,279
we can utilize this concept of a system

306
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,640
manifest now to distill all of the data

307
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,220
that we see in a multi-digabyte memory

308
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,980
image we can just scale that down into a

309
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,040
few megabyte file to now allow us to

310
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,100
replay an analysis Save hours of

311
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,380
investigation and then we can also do

312
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,660
this thing called a snapshot analysis to

313
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,940
see the difference or the similarities

314
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,220
and the differences between a

315
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,260
non-compromised system as well as a

316
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,880
compromise system and then let us

317
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,800
compare these artifacts directly from

318
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,399
memory now this is a very very useful

319
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,920
whenever we're investigating an

320
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
infection similar to like Metasploit or

321
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
interpolar on a system we can now follow

322
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,420
and see when that medicine interpreter

323
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,339
or metasporate a system is compromised

324
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,279
and now the initial compromise or that

325
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,320
binary that's malicious or the the

326
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,880
models that are utilized in that

327
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,800
investigation when it migrates to

328
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,079
another process we can actually follow

329
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,360
where it migrates to we can identify

330
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,399
this because we've seen the the changes

331
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,620
in memory and then we can aggregate this

332
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,600
data across an entire Enterprise to

333
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,640
better find malicious samples based off

334
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,140
of new heuristics just like analysis

335
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,140
so this is a pictorial representation of

336
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,000
what that executive construct looks like

337
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
and we'll get into that into the demo to

338
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,019
come and then let's let's dive right

339
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,459
into the live demo

340
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,519
all right let's get started into the

341
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,380
live demo portion of this presentation

342
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,320
now this is going to be a very very high

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
level I'm going to go quickly so I can

344
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,040
show you the main portions and the

345
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,139
outputs of this tool and as an exercise

346
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,360
for the experts while on your side

347
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,519
you'll be able to spend a lot more time

348
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,380
in this tool as well as follow other

349
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,120
tutorials that we have to get you

350
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,760
further at the new with this program so

351
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,060
everything Begins by going to my GitHub

352
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,920
github.com Solomon Sonia and then we'll

353
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
go ahead and click on Xavier memory

354
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,680
analysis for

355
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,800
framework in order to see where to get

356
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,660
the most updated versions of this tool

357
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,339
as well as all the source code that I

358
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,380
provide and fully open source to

359
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,760
everyone who would like to conduct this

360
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,040
type of analysis now once we come to

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,339
GitHub we'll click on binaries

362
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,560
front version and then we'll download

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,540
the updated version here so right now

364
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,880
I'm working on version

365
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
2.309 and so once you download this

366
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,079
version I will put it into my own folder

367
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,959
called Xavier and then Xavier and see I

368
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,200
just named it version 2.309 just so I

369
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,300
can ensure I'm working on the updated

370
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,940
correct version of this tool now the

371
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,920
first time you launched the tool it will

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,260
ask you for two things the person will

373
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,480
ask you for on the Windows side this

374
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,820
right now mainly works on Windows

375
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,160
machine for the full features and then

376
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,399
once I'm done by version 3 and so forth

377
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,680
that's going to work on cross-platform

378
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,019
compatible again always open source on

379
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,139
Unix as well as any version of Windows

380
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,959
okay so once you open this it will ask

381
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
for the volatility tool on the Windows

382
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,240
side so here if I go into the framework

383
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,700
I click on Imports

384
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,760
import memory analysis this is where

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,579
we'll place the volatility framework the

386
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,500
volatility tool that we can download for

387
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,660
free and so we download that we'll place

388
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,019
it into import memory analysis folder

389
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,660
memory image this is the folder that we

390
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,320
place our mem Labs Lab One

391
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,199
raw image dump that we want our tool to

392
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,940
analyze so I'm going to place that here

393
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,660
and import memory image memo then

394
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,579
there's also a setup of configuration

395
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,440
file that is present here

396
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,079
so instead of the Confederation this is

397
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,300
where we can direct the tool to execute

398
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,639
various functions for us now the three

399
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,680
main ones that we're going to focus in

400
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,199
this presentation are these lines that I

401
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,720
please you know keep these uncommented

402
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,000
so here the first thing that we'll

403
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,260
specify is our investigator name Solomon

404
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,300
for you you're investigating then

405
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,160
investigation descriptions this is where

406
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,399
you can give like a a line a description

407
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,260
of what is the type of investigation

408
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,420
that we are conducting right now I'm

409
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,240
just going to keep it short and say yeah

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,620
and then the profile the profile is

411
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,720
required on volatility that runs on

412
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,579
Windows machines and so here I'll

413
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,000
specify Windows 7 status Pack 1 x 64.

414
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,980
now the specific profile required by

415
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,839
volatility

416
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,500
foreign

417
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,079
double click the tool and then the tool

418
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,880
will launch here and now it's running

419
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,399
it's sent so it's running its setup it's

420
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,260
looking at the volatility tool that we

421
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,899
specified at this site and then it will

422
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,399
give you some prompts here that it's

423
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,740
waiting to understand what that what the

424
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,660
plugins and the parameters of this

425
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,579
volatility tool looks like and then when

426
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,079
it's complete it will show you the

427
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,940
options and the plugins that you can

428
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,800
specify if you want to run plugins

429
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
individually

430
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,820
you can also click on the search and

431
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,880
then search for a specific plugin that

432
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,560
you want like in my site I want to say

433
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,240
hey let's talk about NetSpend Network

434
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,839
scans of this plug of this image so if I

435
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,360
click here I can now search and specify

436
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,279
or I can click on everything and then

437
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,800
I'll specify analyze if I want to

438
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,920
analyze these plugins individually as I

439
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,740
said but that's the old tools or old

440
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,079
capabilities that existed in this tool

441
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,480
what we care about here is the advanced

442
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,920
analysis set

443
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,279
so Advanced analysis automation if we

444
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,279
come here the thing to click on is initi

445
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,920
Advanced analysis so if I click on

446
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,199
initiate Advanced analysis I'm going to

447
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,639
do it so you can see what it's going to

448
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,799
look like on your side once I specify

449
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,140
initiate if that's analysis leave your

450
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,299
machines and execute all of the

451
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,540
respected plugins for 20 30 minutes or

452
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,939
so on my slide it's going to take a

453
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,919
little bit and so on my computer with

454
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,839
this configuration it takes about 30

455
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,140
minutes to analyze a one to five week

456
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,240
memory image in order to produce the

457
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
output reports that we're about to go

458
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,660
through so I'm going to fast forward so

459
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,780
and say okay we've just completed in a

460
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,100
couple of seconds

461
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
experiment

462
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,760
because I said the reason I'm halting it

463
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,080
because because the analysis takes a

464
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,640
while you know let's fast forward 30

465
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,500
minutes before the analysis has complete

466
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,120
another thing that this will actually

467
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,940
provide a good demonstration is let's

468
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,760
say the next day or so on you wants to

469
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,240
replay your analysis where there are or

470
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,520
the good the benefit of this tool is I

471
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,460
put in two import functions and here you

472
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,100
can import a previous analysis a

473
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,440
complete announcer directory or you can

474
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,320
import a manifest file which is a single

475
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,179
file that distills an entire memory

476
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,280
image so instead of always having to

477
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,799
transfer and reload and multi-gigabyte

478
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,260
memory image for the analysis you just

479
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,440
load a few megabytes file and that

480
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,539
describes everything you can you'll see

481
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,120
this here in a few minutes okay so what

482
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,860
I'm going to do after I've I've

483
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,320
completed the analysis here whenever you

484
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,179
do initiate Advanced analysis and this

485
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,340
is the first time and you complete the

486
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,080
analysis you don't need to do any more

487
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,700
Imports you just look through the report

488
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,860
and you continue on what I'm doing is

489
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,360
I'm showing you let's say we've shut

490
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,039
down the tool and now you want to

491
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,740
restart or you shut down the tool and

492
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,720
you sense the data to somewhere else

493
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,820
this is how you reload your previous

494
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,679
results so you can continue forward in

495
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,179
your analysis

496
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,640
so I'm going to go to file import and

497
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,260
then you can either import the system

498
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,900
manifest file a single file that's

499
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,820
located in the Manifest directly I'll

500
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,799
show you in a few moments or you can

501
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,620
import an entire analysis Direction so

502
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,120
I'm going to do the entire analysis

503
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,679
direct page just so you see what the

504
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,059
analysis looks like once again

505
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,460
so on this side I'm going to go to a

506
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,559
previous analysis that I have completed

507
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,900
previously

508
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,760
okay so that's going to be in the export

509
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,980
folder so remember Imports are what you

510
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,320
want the tool to analyze export will be

511
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,419
the outputs that the tool provides for

512
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,620
you

513
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,380
so in export memory analysis and then

514
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,780
there are dates of when the analysis and

515
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,340
the timestamp of when the analysis was

516
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,320
first initiated I'm going to click on

517
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,880
this one that I completed a couple of

518
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,740
days ago so you can see all the results

519
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,160
for us there are a few folders to really

520
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,200
care about and I'll show you that in a

521
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,780
moment here but at this time once we go

522
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,940
to the right export folder click open

523
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,140
and then the full analysis will be

524
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,820
conducted here and then it will provide

525
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,520
the results for us once again

526
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,780
okay

527
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,059
now saying the export folder what does

528
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,520
it look like inside okay also

529
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,620
so if I go into the folder the two main

530
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,120
ones that you really want to care about

531
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,600
will be the HTML export as well as the

532
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,799
Manifest

533
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,539
so I spoke about the Manifest the

534
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,700
Manifest is a single file that distills

535
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,039
all of the data from multi-gigabyte

536
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,440
memory image it distills it down into a

537
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,480
few megabyte file and this is what we

538
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,940
can transfer to any other system to be

539
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,240
ingested by another ingester or to be

540
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,220
reloaded into this tool so now I can

541
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,440
re-complete the analysis and save you

542
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
know

543
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,340
hours of investigation that just replays

544
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,659
exactly what we've seen previously

545
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,900
the HTML the report will be provided for

546
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,679
us

547
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,600
so if I click on that analysis report

548
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,760
this is the HTML file you'll see

549
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
particulars about the investigation

550
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
that's provided at the top side and then

551
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
there are three main sections within

552
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,460
this export file there are the graphs

553
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,320
that we can have semi-interaction with

554
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,880
the analysis results

555
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,900
there are tables that produces graph not

556
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,240
graphical but tabular data about the

557
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,820
analysis and I'm showing you really

558
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,620
quick because there's there's only a

559
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,179
short amount of time for this

560
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,039
demonstration but if I click on let's

561
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,160
say tables for instance here I'm in the

562
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,900
process information so every process

563
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,419
that was discovered in this tool I can

564
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,820
click on that and then it shows me in a

565
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,740
tablet format all of the details about

566
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,620
each process it's in a single line so

567
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,659
this provides better details for us to

568
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,240
see all of the data at one spot there

569
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,679
are a few things that each of these

570
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,140
tables do for us at the Top If I were to

571
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,299
click on any one of these it will also

572
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,360
sort for us so I take your feedback a

573
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,400
previous expert app hey I want you to be

574
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,380
able to sort the data so now it can be

575
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,780
easier to go through and analyze in this

576
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,580
table format and I do that for you just

577
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,960
click on any one of these and it will

578
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,080
sort for you if you also things that

579
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,179
should work most of the time there are

580
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,960
pivots so if I click on a and most use

581
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,480
of this will work um also enhancing the

582
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,520
plugins and interface with the virus

583
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,039
total and other behavioral analysis

584
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,440
engines but for instance if I want to

585
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,240
compare it directly into virus total

586
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
from what we've seen here we can do that

587
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,640
and usually if I click on a specific

588
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,740
process at this side and I clicked on

589
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,900
the link hopefully it should on pivot us

590
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,520
directly into virus total so this one

591
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,740
was not found but some of these images

592
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,919
that's this kind of this one

593
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,140
images like this specific link on this

594
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,820
tool if I just clicked on on it here

595
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,100
dump it clicked on the link it should

596
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,500
filled us into this one so if you listen

597
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,419
to virus tool and then we can further

598
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,120
analyze what other individuals have seen

599
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,220
across this this sample and then you

600
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,900
know usually your red is really really

601
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,000
bad and the more that we've seen this

602
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,039
dump it tool this is a tool that could

603
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,860
be used maliciously but generally

604
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,600
practitioners we use this to procure an

605
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,280
image of the system that we want to

606
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,980
analyze

607
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,179
on the right side we also have other

608
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,799
pivots here that you can go directly

609
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,559
into the virtual address descriptor tree

610
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,419
um we don't have time to talk about this

611
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,039
but that's just ways that we can

612
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,780
interact with the details that we're

613
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,120
providing here in the tables

614
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,820
let's go up to the top let's take a look

615
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,280
at some of these graphs so this graph

616
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,220
shows us the process tree and here we

617
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,900
can kind of expand to determine like

618
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,940
what is the call tree of each of the

619
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,760
processes in the system

620
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,820
graph this we showed you in one of the

621
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,860
Imports previously or we spoke about it

622
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,240
that uh let me show you

623
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,299
in the import directory we should have

624
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,679
said the memory analysis we place

625
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,559
volatility memory image import these two

626
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,900
come in here for analysis and then

627
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,900
packages here graph this we download the

628
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,120
graphics package we can place it into

629
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
the import packages and if that is

630
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,820
provided and present for us we can

631
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,080
executive can interface with that in

632
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
order to show us or to produce this

633
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,559
graph for us automatically

634
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:13,860
now we expand that concept and into

635
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,520
creating the process information tree

636
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,559
and let's go further into the process

637
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,440
the system information tool

638
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
so in this system information tree this

639
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
gives us all the information that Xavier

640
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,919
is able to analyze into their respective

641
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,659
pillars that we're talking about

642
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,480
previously so process your network

643
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,179
information your caches will be down

644
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,380
below

645
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,840
in other details you can expand this to

646
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,880
to determine product but what I want to

647
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,860
click onto constitute

648
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,840
this is the three of processes that are

649
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,820
present inside the system and then we

650
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,919
can dive down even further so when you

651
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,419
are is one of the tools that we spoke

652
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,080
about

653
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
um that we want to look into I also want

654
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,039
to show you one quick feature here and

655
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,840
then we'll continue to fill it on this

656
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,400
side you'll notice and every one of

657
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,220
these frames here there is a short a

658
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,220
relative link to a bigger

659
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,320
table here that we can look at a bigger

660
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,940
graph so I can click on any of these

661
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,159
links open in the links tab

662
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,600
and then what that would do is it will

663
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,000
give us kind of a cleaner view that I

664
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,100
can further interact with just that

665
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,919
details that I was looking at previously

666
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,380
so if I expand my processes I can see

667
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
all the policies in the system I want to

668
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,900
look at when alarm at this side here

669
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,000
because what we specify the hate let's

670
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,740
go ahead and look at this specific

671
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,020
process I like to look at the parent

672
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,200
process relationship The Sibling process

673
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,779
relationship to see other processes that

674
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,480
were instantiated by the same tool this

675
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,580
is also really good in looking at part

676
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,440
eventually you're analyzing a ransomware

677
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,720
type of tool so looking at the signaling

678
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
process can help us identify other

679
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,340
processes that could be utilized for

680
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,620
persistence which can kind of speed up

681
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,500
our analysis even faster

682
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,720
okay so as we're looking through this

683
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
file attributes if I go into the process

684
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,740
information this gives us lots of

685
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,900
details about that single process in a

686
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,940
single instance I can see the command

687
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,320
line we also specify that Imports

688
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,580
important.rar is one of the process we

689
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,440
want to look at here this tool already

690
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,240
shows with that okay let's go ahead and

691
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,820
or these are command line particulars

692
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,919
parameters that were specified in this

693
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,320
analysis

694
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,600
there are lots of other areas that I

695
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,400
want to expand but you know I only have

696
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,320
time just to do a quick or view for this

697
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,820
little bit you know as an exercise to

698
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,500
the expert take a look at these things

699
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,659
to become more familiar with the output

700
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,279
that is provided for us

701
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,559
I want to put it back into the tool set

702
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,340
so one thing you did see is I thought

703
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,600
about command line one of the command

704
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,120
line parameters so important.org let's

705
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,279
say we want to search further about the

706
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,840
specific artifact that we found

707
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,659
important

708
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,240
if I come into the tool here and I click

709
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,059
on my data cross reference inside I can

710
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,580
do a search on anything that we

711
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,600
discussed before so if I say importance

712
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,340
that raw because I want you to look at

713
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,620
important bar and determine what is the

714
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,500
context of this of this of this artifact

715
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,840
here Xavier is searching everything in

716
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,779
in the tool set I can see importing that

717
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,679
Roar is utilized by this process

718
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,940
winrar.exe there's a command line

719
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,919
argument to that which we saw previously

720
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,980
on the graph imported.log there's also

721
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,320
an indication in a separate plugin

722
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,140
called file scan which tells us not only

723
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,679
is that file present or are there hits

724
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,380
to that file but we can also extract

725
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,260
details on that file right here and I'll

726
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,600
show you at the right side so if I look

727
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,659
on the tool in the other searches that

728
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,299
we like we can also include yara's

729
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,220
search Stream So if you want to do your

730
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,640
search screen or there's also a way to

731
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,279
include the RS signature files So it's

732
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,500
talking to another analyst who said he

733
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,980
always likes to do specific searches for

734
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,919
different malware signatures in in every

735
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,840
memory image and so you wanted an easy

736
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,820
way to be able to do those searches

737
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,919
using this tool I said okay no problem I

738
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,900
got you and so I included that feature

739
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,580
here that if you have a Yara signature

740
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,220
file you can specify that do a search

741
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,260
and then it will use that signature file

742
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,779
as well to enrich your searching but

743
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,340
what I wanted what I wanted to show you

744
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,799
is that the right side if a file is

745
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,020
present then this is really really cool

746
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,240
that without even having the hard drive

747
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,940
if it was present in memory we can see

748
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,860
how to dump that file

749
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,600
so what I want to do here is I'm going

750
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
to click on file scan and then if it's

751
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,559
found I'll click on task in and then if

752
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,779
we don't selected five

753
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:48,059
so I click on done selected file a

754
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,500
separates

755
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,659
plugin is going to work and then show

756
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:53,580
those details for us right here at this

757
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,600
side

758
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,960
now another file that we wanted to show

759
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,020
you and from this investigation was that

760
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,740
stage.back so if I bring that back

761
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,240
right here

762
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,220
we say hey what are the details or

763
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,460
contents of this stage dot bat file so

764
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,320
I'm going to take that

765
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,880
and then let's also search for that as

766
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,380
well this is our date of cross reference

767
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,700
in future

768
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,840
so if I do my searching

769
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,980
oh sorry I specify include um signature

770
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,480
thought that's why that um so I don't

771
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,279
include your signature file in this

772
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,720
searching right now

773
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,960
so what I want to show here

774
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,940
that says once we've done that searching

775
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,220
we see that yes there is a hit for that

776
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,340
specific indication actually let me let

777
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,480
me restart this search

778
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,720
options enable Okay let me get my

779
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,860
searching one more time

780
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,059
okay yeah yeah so this is just one thing

781
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,980
so if I click on my search again to the

782
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,240
right side I see that there's an

783
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,059
indication of that file so if I see that

784
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,740
there's an indication I want to do once

785
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,539
again don't selected

786
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,700
from file so I'm going to click don't

787
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,080
select the file

788
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,659
the plugins should run whenever the

789
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,760
execution is complete it should tell us

790
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,580
hey it's done my plugin indication goes

791
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,740
away now if I click on open working

792
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,720
directory

793
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,520
this is that new directory of everything

794
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,899
that we're working on

795
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,480
and then if I go to dumped files right

796
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,340
here dump files

797
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,260
actually these are the two files that

798
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,120
we've done previously directed from the

799
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,559
memory image

800
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,200
if I click on this stage file here I

801
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,600
want to open Notepad

802
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,960
I know this is a a batch file as a

803
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,940
textual

804
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,980
file that I can I can look at so if I

805
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,120
can open

806
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,480
notepad here and I just copy these

807
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,860
details over

808
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,659
we can determine that this is a file

809
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,340
that was dumped it was a simple batch

810
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,860
file that said output this details to

811
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,299
the command prompt

812
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:59,100
all right I'm going to come back to this

813
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,879
in one second

814
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,039
in our Advanced analysis directly here

815
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,740
the Xavier once it completes its

816
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,320
analysis there are one or more

817
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,120
additional times that should open would

818
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,880
specify hey I need you as the analyst to

819
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,399
focus your attention on these details

820
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:18,539
first

821
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,760
in the interest of time I'm going to

822
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,760
come to this specific tab here in which

823
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,640
I'm looking at the console details for

824
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,620
whatever was shown on a terminal which

825
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,480
is really really cool so without being

826
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,340
on the system at the time of execution

827
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,279
we can see this is what these are the

828
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,320
details or Tech that was provided to the

829
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,240
user previously

830
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,580
and so if I scroll down I said there's a

831
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,380
command line into this history

832
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,140
information that we can look at we see

833
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,760
this is a title of something that we

834
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,340
said to search for

835
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,580
command details and then the output

836
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,159
so the output of that is shown right

837
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,440
here just as we've seen so in one

838
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,360
instance we're looking at the terminal

839
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,020
text from a user and then we'll email or

840
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,059
we're actually able to download the file

841
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,980
here to do additional analysis that I've

842
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,600
shown you from the data data cross

843
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,700
referencing if you're not serve a

844
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,799
specific file let's say we only have an

845
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,659
entry like this name that we want to

846
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,820
look at you can also do searching just

847
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,100
on that specific stream but then again

848
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,980
we get additional context just of what

849
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,080
we're searching for so we can see that

850
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
compost there's lots of hits to that

851
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,820
specific file that follows me in

852
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,620
command.exe so we know something with

853
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,840
execute it from the command line and

854
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,000
then outputs was provided under this

855
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,940
user content C user smart net

856
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,220
and then once again I just like shown we

857
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,200
already downloaded this previously but

858
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,700
if you also wanted to download the

859
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,399
memory of the image to search further

860
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:51,240
you can do that at this specific side

861
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,100
let me come back right so we've gone

862
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,419
through this data cost preferencing

863
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:56,580
which helps us really quickly on a

864
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,340
challenge or so in our investigation

865
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,039
then there's user assist entries

866
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,480
I'm going to talk about this user assist

867
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,899
entries just um for a moment now if I

868
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,000
click on this this is text separated

869
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,059
values like TSB Text data and now Alex

870
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,760
I'll explain the usefulness of this

871
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,919
output and why this is shown here user

872
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,899
assist entries is a specific plugin that

873
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,419
volatility provides for us but in

874
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:23,399
particular I want to show you two

875
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:25,380
features um here on why I care about

876
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,179
this one you can click on the bottom

877
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:30,059
here where it says export data so I

878
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,519
click on export data on a Windows

879
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,740
machine I can click on desktop or

880
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,899
anywhere I want to store something and

881
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:39,980
this is user user assistant

882
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,019
if I click to save that data I can open

883
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,539
this again or anytime this says export I

884
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,059
can open that in a notepad file and then

885
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,679
it just allows me to do searching you

886
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,140
know I can zoom in ETC as I require but

887
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,140
as I said this is tab separated data so

888
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,659
the status updated data that means I can

889
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:00,179
put this into a separate and just a

890
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,700
program like Excel

891
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,860
so I open Excel on my computer

892
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,960
Excel opens here I can copy and paste

893
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,418
that data at this site

894
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,060
I'm now going to kind of expand the tabs

895
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,980
here now yes this is a lot of data but

896
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,800
in memory analysis challenges

897
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,960
sometimes you're just giving a raw image

898
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,659
instead and Tool find the malicious file

899
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,580
find you know what happened on the

900
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,040
system and you have no other particulars

901
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,139
about hey where do I start

902
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,540
in an investigation in the absence of

903
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,339
any additional data we always have to

904
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,800
start from some point and so user assist

905
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,139
is a good place that you could consider

906
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:42,659
starting from because what this provides

907
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,060
for us if I go to the right side you

908
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,219
have a focused time

909
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:50,879
and so my hypothesis is that something

910
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,879
that is more important to the user has a

911
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,099
longer time that it has been focused and

912
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:57,660
so this is where the user has directed

913
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,040
their time frame

914
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,020
and in the absence of any additional

915
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,460
details if you're like hey here's an

916
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,440
image find what occurred and type A

917
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,080
Memory image okay let me export that

918
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,780
data to an Excel I'm going to do a

919
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,660
custom sort here

920
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,500
custom sort by time focused I'm going to

921
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,380
order this by larger to smaller data

922
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,300
here I'm going to click ok

923
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,339
and then what I'm looking at is whatever

924
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:25,200
executed for the longest amount of time

925
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,820
for the user

926
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,980
and if I start to scroll down you see

927
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,720
that these are important aspects that

928
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,940
control panel here explore that we

929
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,000
exceed the user opencalc.exe so I'm

930
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,500
going to write down all of these things

931
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,420
to investigate further to that links

932
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,160
just give us an idea of what is

933
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,320
important to the user at the time that's

934
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,040
something the foreign

935
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,480
and the amount of time it was executed

936
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,300
on the system dump it wasn't important

937
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,339
tool that was executed on the system

938
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,660
that is highlighted for us Solitaire

939
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,520
command.exe this is where our Command

940
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,800
history comes from so anytime I see

941
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,300
these things I'm like oh I'm gonna have

942
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,220
to search further for these specific

943
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,740
things first to now begin to build my

944
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,320
timeline the man that exe notepad was

945
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,140
important and then here's Winrock winwar

946
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,359
was installed on the machine most likely

947
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,180
by Firefox as the installer

948
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,140
um

949
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,359
as in scholar tool on the assistant and

950
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,400
so forth but at least I'm showing you

951
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,680
that hey here's where to start from and

952
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,380
here's what to look at again smartnet

953
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,440
user desktop that stage that bat it was

954
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,440
also executed on the system but I I kind

955
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,420
of focused these for you to kind of

956
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,280
enhance the analysis and make this move

957
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,800
even faster on this system

958
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,700
foreign

959
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,500
actually looks like this is the output

960
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,180
that you'll just have to spend some time

961
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,760
searching to determine what happens all

962
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,619
of the questions that I ask you in the

963
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,200
slides it's going to be included in the

964
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,940
appendix so you can see like how to

965
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,460
solve this problem one by one but at

966
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,800
least you see the framework the outputs

967
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,720
tables and totally the title of the data

968
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
you can click on these various links um

969
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,339
to put it directly into virus total if a

970
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,200
hit is found that someone has updated

971
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,420
power uploaded previously

972
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,760
if I scroll down as well execution

973
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,440
plugins let's say you want to look at

974
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,960
each individual plugin directly that's

975
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,300
fine these are the particulars of every

976
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,220
single plugin that is executed in raw

977
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,320
format for you and then again to click

978
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,119
on the bottom you can pivot over into

979
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,220
those specific tabs to see this is the

980
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,079
raw data that now the executive tool

981
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,079
analyzes further for us

982
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:45,119
there are many other features that

983
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,740
you're you'll be able to click through

984
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,859
and search in your analysis but at least

985
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:52,200
for now this is a good place to see this

986
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,599
is how to get started in this in this

987
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,820
tool thing

988
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,560
and with that I'll turn back over to the

989
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,780
presentation to provide closing comments

990
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,240
as well as answer any questions that we

991
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,839
might have to

992
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,720
