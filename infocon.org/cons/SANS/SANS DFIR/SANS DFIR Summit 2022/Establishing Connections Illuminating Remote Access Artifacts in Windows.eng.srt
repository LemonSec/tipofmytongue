1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,340
hey everyone welcome uh thank you for

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,960
that introduction I certainly appreciate

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,740
it

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,179
um as mentioned we will be talking about

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,759
artifacts and remote access tools and

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,660
why is this a topic well from my time uh

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,279
in the army with the Department of

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,160
Defense it was certainly a concern uh

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,980
and certainly within my time uh in Mandy

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,779
and we're seeing a lot of this being

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,300
being used as well so it was only right

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
it's only fitting so a little bit about

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,160
myself on top of what he mentioned I met

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
Mandy yes retired from the U.S army

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,719
about half of my career there was in

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,100
cyber security

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,079
um forensics incident response I'm also

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,700
an adjunct cyber security Professor

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,820
where I teach python at a University of

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,879
Arizona I'm a powersheller also at heart

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,539
I believe in education so there's two uh

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,239
training platforms that I manage uh all

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,100
about giving somebody an opportunity to

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,379
learn a language and hone their skills

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,420
so let's get into this a little bit more

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,960
so remote access use well why is this

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,260
even a thing well from a legitimacy

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,780
perspective it certainly improves

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,659
productivity right allowing me for

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,299
example to be able to not have to sit at

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,000
my desk on cubicle 24 7 but being able

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
to access my workstation system files

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,799
what have you from afar so that's good

35
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,320
that's a plus the other thing is it

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,840
drives collaboration now in this day and

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,240
age we don't necessarily think of remote

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,299
access tools as a collaboration driver

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,040
we probably would think of things like

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,560
teams and and things of that nature

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,840
however that functionality is certainly

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,979
built in and was part of the overall

43
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,799
purpose of it so that's still a thing

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,960
and then number three I think three is

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,460
probably the biggest thing that we see

46
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,740
within organizations in which it is

47
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,860
being used because uh I.T professionals

48
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,479
generally aren't going to walk to your

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,340
desk to be able to access your machine

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,860
to assist it allows them to sit right

51
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,899
where they are to be able to do those

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,940
things so while this isn't an

53
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,340
all-inclusive list of really the

54
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,920
benefits and why remote access tools are

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
being used it certainly highlights uh

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,840
three things that are really kind of key

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,020
for the use of the tools now on top of

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,780
that we also have well why do threat

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,160
actors use it and I would tell you

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,780
threat actors are certainly using it

61
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,260
anything from apts to groups certainly

62
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,020
financially and otherwise motivated well

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,480
largely they use it because of a number

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
of things and I won't say these in in

65
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
any particular order per se but the ease

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,319
of use right so being able to drop that

67
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,599
file on there install it in most cases

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,180
in a silent perspective and then being

69
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,280
able to be off to the races with did

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,379
little to no configuration needed you

71
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,540
really can't beat that the next part of

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,819
it is generally organizations aren't

73
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,160
even monitoring for these tools be it

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,840
the tool that they're actually using in

75
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,080
their organization or just use for other

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
remote access Tools in their environment

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,280
at large so because it's largely going

78
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,959
on monitored or they're certainly

79
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,300
inconsistencies associated with it it

80
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,819
makes it certainly attractive for threat

81
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,040
actors to be able to use it and the last

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,560
thing I'll mention certainly is if it is

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,780
a tool or capability that you're already

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,480
using in your organization then they

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,400
have the opportunity to kind of blend in

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,680
with that traffic if we're using a

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,180
remote access tool in our environment

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,700
right now we're largely if we are even

89
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,599
monitoring it we're largely going to

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,220
acknowledge that traffic that activity

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,019
is something that's standard our

92
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,640
environment you see it and you're like

93
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,440
oh yeah we use that so it's good right

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,420
so you already discounted that allows

95
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,920
the threat actor to certainly blend in

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,840
with that aspect and they certainly take

97
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
advantage of that so again not an

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,519
all-inclusive list but certainly how

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
highlighting a couple of things in which

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,620
remote access tools become attractive to

101
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,200
threat actors

102
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
so it's no secret that at mandian we

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,440
produce a annual report called entrance

104
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,760
if you haven't read it certainly

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
recommend you do that there's a number

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,959
of organizations that also produce some

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,360
form of an annual report certainly worth

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,760
the read based upon what that

109
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,180
organization is seeing or has saw within

110
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,880
the last year so looking at the M trans

111
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,639
report of the most frequently seen

112
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
techniques the top ten we see that

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
number eight is remote Services remote

114
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,440
services and Compasses of remote access

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,419
tools so of the top 10

116
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,520
techniques that we've saw roughly 27

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,900
percent

118
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,580
of them

119
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,860
um contain remote access Services again

120
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,380
with remote access tools being bucketed

121
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
in there now just to not really present

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,199
such a subjective view if you will again

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,300
working for mandate dealing with this on

124
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,580
a daily basis I'll at least provide one

125
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,580
more so from a scissor perspective uh

126
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,660
when asked upon requests they do uh risk

127
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,759
and vulnerability assessments for

128
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,400
organizations uh they modeled those

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,320
assessments based upon the miter

130
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,660
framework uh everybody's familiar with

131
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,800
the minor attacks and given that when we

132
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,259
still are looking at remote access tools

133
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,539
well we see it in a number of categories

134
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,180
right we see where remote access tools

135
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,699
are being encompassed as part of initial

136
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,560
access right

137
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,180
um we're seeing it where it's been

138
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
encompassed uh from the perspective of

139
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,820
persistence okay we're also seeing it

140
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,039
from the perspective of lateral movement

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,259
right thinking about lateral movement

142
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,100
from saying pc1 talked directly to PC2

143
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,100
talked directly to PC3 not necessarily

144
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,320
in that case now they're all going back

145
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,660
out to broker relay servers and then

146
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,699
moving in that perspective again an

147
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:58,800
opportunity an ability if you will for

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,620
them to blend in a little bit more and

149
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,419
then kind of last but certainly not

150
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,039
least the reason it for command and

151
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,620
control and as we talk about uh

152
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,620
particularly one of these uh remote

153
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,440
access tools and we look at the UI you

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
may be looking at it like man this is a

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,940
good rat right like why go go out there

156
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,300
and spend money on dev time and a number

157
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,680
of other things when you can just kind

158
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,800
of utilize uh that so again looking at

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,860
it from a different perspective as well

160
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,880
so we are focused or will be focused

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,300
specifically on Windows well why is that

162
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,300
the case again another excerpt from the

163
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,699
M trans report when we look at the

164
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,639
effectiveness of malware from the year

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
2021 Windows overwhelmingly right that's

166
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,880
what we see that's the market share the

167
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,259
interesting thing about remote access

168
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,080
tools though is a lot of them most of

169
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,840
them are cross-platform right so just

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
because we're focusing on Windows today

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
doesn't mean these same tools are not

172
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,940
just as effective on other platforms but

173
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,280
I really wanted to hone in on one aspect

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,800
okay so while there's a plethora of

175
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,080
these remote access tools we'll just

176
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
kind of talk at a high level really the

177
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,139
the communication low if you will so we

178
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,699
have a workstation we'll say workstation

179
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,860
one near the top got workstation two

180
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,139
near the bottom each has their own IP

181
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,199
address with the application installed

182
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
we'll talk from the perspective of it

183
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,160
being installed well they are going to

184
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,039
communicate independently with a broker

185
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,440
a relay server right and I'll use that

186
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,300
terminology Loosely because depending on

187
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,340
which type of tool we're talking about

188
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,160
they may uh refer to it as something

189
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,039
different and as they check in with that

190
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,259
server well they're each going to get

191
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,139
their own ID a unique identifier

192
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,240
associated with that application and

193
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,840
that server by utilizing that ID well

194
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
they can then connect to each other they

195
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
are connecting largely through the relay

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,639
server through the broker who is

197
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,440
essentially going to bridge that

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,300
connection so in this case workstation

199
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,660
one is beginning its uh initiation to

200
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,020
connect to workstation 2. and as that

201
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,440
connection is uh created brokered a

202
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,419
course through the broker or the relay

203
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,840
server if you will uh authentication to

204
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,819
that machine is largely going to be done

205
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:31,800
in one of two ways

206
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,360
option A

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,059
well there could be an unattained access

208
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,479
configured what's this unattend access

209
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,219
well they could already have the

210
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,339
username and password configured on the

211
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:47,040
distant machine allowing them to be able

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
to access that machine at will without

213
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
any authorization or any input from the

214
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,060
remote machine itself right you can

215
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,800
almost think about it as having that

216
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
pre-established authorization

217
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,339
option two well they could essentially

218
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,980
still connect to the machine but then on

219
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,839
the distant machine it's going to prompt

220
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,600
the user that's already logged in to

221
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,720
accept the connection hey PC one is

222
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,360
trying to log in blah blah blah do you

223
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,820
want to allow it or not allow it right

224
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,519
that's really the options that we have

225
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,459
as you could imagine threat actors don't

226
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,320
like to use that second option right

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
that's not really productive in in their

228
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,019
their line of work right uh no person is

229
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,060
going to be at their desk get a random

230
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,000
uh you know uh request and be like oh

231
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,740
yeah let me let them log in real quick

232
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,080
oh you want my mouse sure thing

233
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,519
um actually I gotta go get something to

234
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:47,420
drink so I'll be back anyway

235
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,339
um so looking at these tools right like

236
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,060
there's dozens maybe hundreds low

237
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,600
hundreds of these tools right so I mean

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,700
some of them as I bring them to the

239
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,399
screen are some that we've seen or I've

240
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,700
seen in my past experience right not to

241
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,220
say one is much more prevalent than the

242
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,160
next but certainly a threat actor

243
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,740
doesn't care right we're talking Windows

244
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,899
of opportunity to be able to meet their

245
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,560
overall intent right small list of a

246
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,779
much larger list that is certainly

247
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:22,740
available

248
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,800
we don't have time to talk about all of

249
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,899
the ones listed here so we're just going

250
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,420
to bucket it down to a smaller group

251
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,279
right and that smaller group is going to

252
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,100
be any desk and connect wise connect

253
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,959
wise used to be called screen connect

254
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,019
right uh but nonetheless cool let's talk

255
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,880
about both of those we'll start off with

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,380
any desk

257
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,440
so any desk has three modes in which it

258
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,620
could be essentially used if you will

259
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,560
mode one it could be installed once you

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,839
install it there's a service associated

261
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,640
with it that service runs this system

262
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,100
Okay cool so then there's some form of

263
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,839
persistence because that service is

264
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,760
going to automatically start

265
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,459
option two you could use it in a

266
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,060
portable mode right meaning it's not

267
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,160
installed you're just running that

268
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,980
application as needed when you do that

269
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,560
it's going to look in the current

270
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,300
directory that that executable is in for

271
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,100
gcapi.dll and if it's not there it's

272
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,839
going to look in the temp directory if

273
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,160
it's not there then it's going to look

274
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
to download it that becomes an artifact

275
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,940
in which we could typically look for

276
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,060
right the other mode is going to uh that

277
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,700
we have available is a portable with

278
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,560
elevation but what's the difference

279
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,079
between regular portable portable with

280
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,740
elevation well with portable if we were

281
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,779
trying to do anything that required

282
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,540
elevating our rights required higher

283
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,839
rights in the UAC prompt came up we

284
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,060
wouldn't be able to see that if we're

285
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,700
utilizing any disk in the regular

286
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,140
portable mode

287
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,779
if we want to be able to elevate said

288
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:01,980
rights

289
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,560
um by way of being able to type in the

290
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,779
UAC prompt as it came up then we're

291
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,519
going to need to utilize the other

292
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,480
option now I've seen a mixture in which

293
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,660
threat actors have utilized any deaths

294
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,519
in some cases

295
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,160
um they don't care right

296
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
um they have no respect if you will and

297
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
they'll just install it right on your

298
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,000
box right in other cases they'll

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,440
download it go straight to downloads

300
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,420
they'll execute it right from there and

301
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,980
again they still have no respect they

302
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,200
don't even clean up after themselves

303
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,380
um so it's kind of a mixture of it now

304
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,300
uh when we look at the logs that are

305
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,420
available we won't hit every artifact I

306
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,760
want to talk about some some high Visual

307
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,100
and some some things to really

308
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,839
um give you something that you can walk

309
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,579
away with and look for in your

310
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:52,500
environment the logs when we're talking

311
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,820
about

312
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,279
um any desk being installed on your

313
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,740
system well it's going to be in any desk

314
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,560
folder within excuse me the program data

315
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,260
directory okay and we'll talk about some

316
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,760
of the the logs that are in there you

317
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,440
see a snippet of it in the top right

318
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,399
hand corner we also have uh logs that

319
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,040
when it's installed or in portable mode

320
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,860
they are installed in the app data

321
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,079
directory of that user but then there's

322
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,839
also uh the pictures directory and

323
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
videos directory and that user's profile

324
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,540
and we see a snippet of one of those in

325
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,459
the bottom right hand corner talk a

326
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,440
little bit more about some of those here

327
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,480
in a minute one thing to highlight

328
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,800
because if we're doing this in a

329
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
response and we're getting logs from a

330
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
number of places we need to figure out

331
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,160
what long time or what time Source we're

332
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,839
dealing with or else that timeline is

333
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,399
going to be all kind of jacked up so the

334
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
good thing here uh any desk logs are are

335
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,660
going to be in UTC for us so that's

336
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,620
that's super helpful

337
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,820
okay so one of those logs within those

338
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,380
directories is called connection

339
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,040
underscore trace.txt and this is simply

340
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,399
logging connections to the machine right

341
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,820
so we see a number of uh essentially

342
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,519
separated columns if you will and

343
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,740
reading it is maybe not as

344
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,899
straightforward just off initial look or

345
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,639
maybe it is but certainly with a little

346
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,380
bit of explanation it becomes a lot

347
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,060
clearer one thing I noticed certainly

348
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,420
with any desk is they don't give build

349
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,300
names for their logs they want you to

350
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,459
send the logs to them because the logs

351
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,200
are not made for you to be able to do

352
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,240
forensics on them they're really used

353
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,060
for Diagnostics should anything happen

354
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,139
and you call upon them right so we're

355
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,260
essentially getting the user that's good

356
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,800
now the user uh could be useful could

357
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,959
not be useful we get the connection ID

358
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,260
that's certainly useful uh not being law

359
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,540
enforcement if we need to

360
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,420
um get more in-depth information we can

361
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,560
certainly pass that off to law

362
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,060
enforcement and allow law enforcement to

363
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,160
connect or contact any desk and then be

364
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,060
able to get a little bit more

365
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,100
information that aspect the real thing

366
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,320
that I wanted to highlight here is that

367
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,220
Third Field where we see past WD user

368
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,720
and a number of other things kind of

369
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,760
going down well that's going to

370
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
highlight how the user connected to this

371
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,399
machine this is on the remote machine

372
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,220
the machine that is being connected to

373
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,180
and if it's user well that is somebody

374
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,699
connected to them and they were prompted

375
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,399
to allow them in and they accepted it

376
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,420
okay if it's rejected same thing but

377
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,920
instead of them allowing that connection

378
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,320
they rejected that connection

379
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,519
okay

380
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,180
and then when we look at uh past WD this

381
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,519
is where the unattended foul is being

382
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:47,100
used so they've set it up to where they

383
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,399
can access the machine without any

384
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,500
um user on a distant end allowing that

385
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,079
connection but they're forced or prompt

386
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,480
to put in the password right they know

387
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
the password or should know the password

388
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,980
their prompt to put it in each time and

389
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,380
then token is the same thing but the

390
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,779
password is saved so now when they want

391
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,160
to connect to that machine they can

392
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,260
simply double click uh the tile

393
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,240
associated with it and it automatically

394
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,940
logs them in all right so that allows us

395
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,279
to see how that connection is actually

396
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,560
made

397
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,779
two more log files associated with any

398
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,240
desks uh what we have two Trace files

399
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,040
one is ad.trace the other AD underscore

400
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,839
sbc.trace A D dot Trace speaks to web UI

401
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,360
um artifacts or really actions that are

402
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,399
taking place which is why we see things

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,560
like error and connection events being

404
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,740
logged there this is a file that's going

405
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,600
to be resident no matter if it's

406
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,899
installed or in a portable mode if this

407
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,380
running is an installed mode this file

408
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,759
will only contain those things I just

409
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,220
mentioned if it's running in portable

410
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,440
mode it will contain those things but it

411
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,880
would also contain a little bit more

412
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,300
verbose data so the perspective of the

413
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,140
next aspect so ad underscore SVC things

414
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,299
that are in there that's only going to

415
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,459
be resident when we're running an uh

416
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:13,319
installed mode and this is going to

417
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,020
really capture more bobos data than what

418
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,959
we saw above but more specific

419
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,939
specifically we get get network focused

420
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,220
data so this is where we see things like

421
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,119
Source IP addresses pids if files were

422
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,059
transfer uh what relays were being used

423
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,100
this is going to be more of the bread

424
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,059
and butter

425
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,360
but again that file only exists when

426
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,940
we're running in installed mode if I'm

427
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,240
running in portable mode then that SBC

428
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,580
file doesn't exist but the contacts

429
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
contents rather that would normally be

430
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,960
there would then be in the other one 80

431
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,120
dot Trace so this is going to be our

432
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,179
bread and butter looking at what that

433
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,380
file looks like well it's just stuff in

434
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,360
a file right you got to kind of make

435
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,080
sense of it sometimes it's not as easily

436
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,179
understood any desktops and produce a

437
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,860
whole lot of documentation out there in

438
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,380
regards to that why because this file is

439
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,260
not for you this file is for them when

440
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,059
they are contacted to be able to assist

441
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,919
with Diagnostics and understand what's

442
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:17,940
going on

443
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,360
so in this case in this example uh I

444
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
have the file from a local machine I

445
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,679
have the file on the bottom from a

446
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,220
remote machine the local machine its ID

447
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,360
begins with 430 any desk IDs are nine

448
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,580
nine digits by the way so I just blacked

449
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,280
out uh the last six digits the remote

450
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,460
machine it begins with 669 so when we

451
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,679
look at that local machine and now what

452
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,220
I have circled we see that there's uh an

453
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,419
entry where it's connecting to 669 that

454
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,520
would be again that bottom machine

455
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,520
and then several lines below that we see

456
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,400
the source IP address of the local

457
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,360
machine so where it says logged in from

458
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,400
that is from the perspective of it

459
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,520
connecting to the relay server so if I

460
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,799
were to look at this log I'm like okay

461
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,700
it connected to uh in any desk ID 669

462
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,059
such as such at this time at the the

463
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,280
following time I'm able to see what if

464
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,740
address that system had at the time I'd

465
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,299
be addressed that they had at the time

466
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,460
is less of uh

467
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,580
of use for me in most cases what's

468
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,559
really going to be beneficial is the

469
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,600
bottom law the system that is being

470
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,780
remoted into or connected to so we're

471
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,980
able to see the uh any desk ID that

472
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,080
connected to the machine again outside

473
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,360
of the other log that we have and then

474
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,539
we're able to see the raw IP address

475
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,240
of that connecting machine because if we

476
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,220
were to look at a net stat what we're

477
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,919
going to see is connections to any desk

478
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,679
relay servers we're not going to see the

479
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,200
raw IP address that's connecting so this

480
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
is where we start to be able to trace

481
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,640
that back now looking at this log file

482
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,539
that could be several Pages worth of

483
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,000
data I don't want to be scrolling up and

484
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,559
down trying to okay that line is not

485
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,760
important that line is not important

486
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,919
right so I'll talk about a few functions

487
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,140
uh that I created to kind of make this

488
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,059
easier for you because anybody doing IR

489
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,220
we know that this is a results driven

490
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,140
field and we can't be looking at a data

491
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
set

492
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,380
um forever right so we want to be able

493
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,000
to get speed we want to get it I'll be

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,620
able to get accuracy with it all at the

495
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,840
same time

496
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,539
something else that's useful here is any

497
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,660
desk has the ability to be able to take

498
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,120
screenshots or pictures of the distant

499
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,960
machine so simply there's a a GUI menu

500
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,820
option for it and then when those

501
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,400
pictures are being taken they are stored

502
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
locally so a use case here is threat

503
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,160
actor is connected to your box

504
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,539
um you don't know they're connected

505
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,460
they're seeing you do whatever it is

506
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,780
that you're doing that's of Interest

507
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,520
they take a screenshot that is saved

508
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,100
locally to their system okay cool now

509
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,419
they also have the ability to take video

510
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:11,700
associated with it as well maybe you're

511
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,440
browsing the internet you may go to your

512
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,760
banking site or whatever the case they

513
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,740
can take that video unbeknownst to you

514
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,559
that also is saved locally to the

515
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,260
machine not on the machine in which they

516
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
are connected to

517
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,419
the other thing here is every machine

518
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,159
that

519
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,740
um you have been connected to it will

520
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,919
store the thumbnails of the desktop

521
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,260
background so when I look at those

522
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,059
pictures in the bottom right hand corner

523
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,520
uh they're in pairs right so we have a

524
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
DOT PNG we have a DOT I code the first

525
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,820
set in the third set those look like

526
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,179
standard Windows backgrounds that middle

527
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:52,740
set that looks a little bit more

528
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,900
customized that's actually my lab

529
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,000
machine right so you start to look at

530
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,320
backgrounds you might be able to start

531
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,900
to discern a little something so that's

532
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,120
super useful for us um or could be

533
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,460
helpful for us in the context of our

534
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,740
investigation

535
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,039
another thing about any desk that I I

536
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,620
guess is a feature right I guess it's a

537
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,120
feature right I thought Microsoft was

538
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
the only one making features however

539
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,740
um there's an ability to do tunneling

540
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,440
through any disk right like port

541
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,340
forwarding so for this to work you have

542
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,240
to have an establish any desk connection

543
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
and once you have that any that any desk

544
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,880
connection that remote machine can then

545
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,120
forward traffic on your behalf so a use

546
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,159
case here would be I have workstation

547
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,980
one workstation two both of them have

548
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,679
any desk workstation one connects to

549
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,799
work station two but guess what even

550
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,720
outside of that connection workstation

551
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,740
one can't get to workstation 3.

552
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,900
workstation 2 does have a path to

553
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,320
workstation 3. so through tunneling we

554
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,200
can connect to workstation 2 and through

555
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,659
workstation 2 we can access Workstation

556
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,320
3. setting this up is quite simple

557
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,780
there's a menu option the menu is shown

558
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,120
in the top right hand corner we can do

559
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,640
uh forward uh tunnels we could do

560
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,740
reverse tunnels as well so just using

561
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,360
the four up tunnel what I was just

562
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,580
talking about you can see we put in the

563
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,400
local Port I.E the local port on our

564
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,799
machine that we want to connect to and

565
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,980
when we connect to it what is the remote

566
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,460
IP address and remote Port that we want

567
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,059
to connect to as well so again this is

568
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,100
the future if you want to call it that

569
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,780
but certainly threat actors are

570
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,240
utilizing this as well because again as

571
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,740
we you know through years of

572
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,900
Investigation all of us here looking at

573
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,820
tunneling of different sorts we

574
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,159
recognize that um the source is truly

575
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,320
obfuscated and we start to see or start

576
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,000
to think that that traffic originated

577
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,520
from the machine that that traffic is uh

578
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,500
is coming from or is being remoted

579
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
through

580
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,419
so enough about any desk

581
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,179
let's talk about connect wise uh what I

582
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,900
like to call a full featured uh C2

583
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,940
platform right

584
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,100
uh so connectwise formerly known as

585
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,720
screen connect I only say that because

586
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
one just so you know with two some of

587
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,419
the uh directory structure still

588
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,820
reference screen connect so I just

589
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,860
didn't want to cause any confusion there

590
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,679
but it can be installed in one of two

591
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,500
modes either on-prem or in the cloud

592
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,500
doing on-prem is a lot more difficult

593
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,720
today than what it used to be because

594
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,520
they're trying to force everybody as you

595
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,260
can imagine I'm sorry encourage

596
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,039
everybody to move to the cloud right the

597
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,840
good thing about the cloud from a

598
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,720
malicious perspective is that it takes

599
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,020
little to no setup to get going now this

600
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,480
is a paid for service but they'll allow

601
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,000
you to have 14 days for free and you

602
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
don't even need a credit card if I'm not

603
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,760
me per se but let's say it was me uh

604
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,020
getting ready to do a ransomware

605
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,480
campaign uh 14 days is more than enough

606
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,640
right for me to be able to get in there

607
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,620
move around like I need to and then drop

608
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,260
that next payload so see a threat actors

609
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,240
really take advantage of this route

610
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,700
where they can stand up attendant

611
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,919
leverage it and then go about their

612
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:24,179
married business

613
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,520
the logs associated with this platform

614
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,600
are largely written to the Windows Event

615
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,500
law right so we see the perspective of a

616
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,020
little bit or mostly the application log

617
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,520
which I'll talk about here shortly

618
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,820
looking at the structure though of other

619
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,640
artifacts that could be on the system we

620
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,039
have the temp directory has a screen

621
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,679
connect folder and then there's a

622
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,500
subdirectory with the version of screen

623
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,779
connect so that's interesting and that's

624
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,940
really uh kind of helpful in some

625
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,460
respect because when an actor stands up

626
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,440
that

627
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,140
connectwise tenant they then compile or

628
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,360
make their agent and it's going to be

629
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,340
customized to their own individual

630
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,900
tenant

631
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,720
the other thing we have is we have in

632
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,419
the program data directory uh within

633
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,760
screen connect There's an actual user

634
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,520
config or use a cough rather

635
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,000
um file and it's not in my opinion very

636
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,320
helpful other than it will note the last

637
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,059
directory used uh for file transfer so

638
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,000
at the time of this uh capturing if you

639
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
will we were using C users Nando

640
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,200
documents plugin if I were to retrieve

641
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,360
another file or send another file then

642
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
that path will be replaced with the

643
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,980
latest one so it's only going to give

644
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,200
you the latest right so we could argue

645
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,940
how useful that's going to be we'll talk

646
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,380
about some more methods to be able to

647
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,260
get some more historical aspect

648
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,299
we also have this app config by default

649
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:05,360
most if not all of these remote access

650
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,799
uh platforms

651
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,039
they're not made to secretly get on a

652
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,960
distant machine right you look at

653
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,460
something like TeamViewer you got the

654
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,020
little black window a little box that

655
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,279
comes off from the side the background

656
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,740
changes a lot of these have some type of

657
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,100
uh thing on the screen to show that

658
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,419
somebody else is connected in the

659
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,840
machine well with the app config we can

660
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,840
go in there and actually configure our

661
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,840
uh connectwise connection to not show

662
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,880
those things hey there's a banner that's

663
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,559
normally up top yeah I don't want that

664
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,179
turn that off hey there's something that

665
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,940
shows in the system tray yeah no I don't

666
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,679
want that either to turn that off so you

667
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,419
ultimately can get to a point and this

668
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,279
is what the red actors love to do get to

669
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,200
a point where it doesn't look like

670
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,299
anybody is in there and your method to

671
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,820
be able to tell is to essentially look

672
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,100
at a netstat to see that established

673
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,760
connection right uh so again looking at

674
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,919
the app config we could see all those

675
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,799
configurations in which are customized

676
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,020
to show that those things are not in

677
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,179
place

678
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:12,120
so I mentioned that connectwise largely

679
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,880
uses the event logs um to be able to

680
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
capture this data one of the biggest

681
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,779
things that are going to come out is

682
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,440
when this gets installed a course 7045

683
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,480
log gets written and that's going to be

684
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,279
the same thing with any desk and

685
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,500
anything else rather

686
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,200
there are some juiciness in that 70 45

687
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,000
log which I have down at the bottom

688
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,080
specifically we'll have the instance ID

689
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,240
associated with the tenant so if and

690
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,460
when you get to a point where you're

691
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,260
trying to contact connectwise on your

692
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,179
own or you're leveraging law enforcement

693
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,279
to be able to do that or some other

694
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,440
thread Intel platform to be able to

695
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,960
understand any other campaigns going on

696
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,659
that's leverage in that same instance ID

697
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,340
well that's where we're going to get

698
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,720
that from

699
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,179
the other thing when we look at the logs

700
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,059
in the application log connect wise

701
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,740
events are written as eib0

702
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,140
eib0 so when there's a remote connection

703
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,419
that started well in the top right hand

704
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,400
corner we're seeing what that log looks

705
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,919
like it'll list the name of the user and

706
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,320
tell you there was a connection

707
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,320
that is it so it's not really as

708
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,419
descriptive as one may want it we at

709
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,820
least get a time stamp we get a user and

710
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,340
we see the event is connected the same

711
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,320
thing when the session is terminated

712
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,500
we'll see the user we'll see we'll get a

713
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,620
time stamp and we see the actual action

714
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,940
now when it comes to transferring a file

715
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,779
to the remote machine that gets logged

716
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,120
in the event log as well in this case we

717
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,880
see we transfer a beacon.exe doesn't

718
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,679
tell me where on disk it transferred it

719
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,320
to it just says it got transferred

720
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,080
now what we don't get is when we take

721
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,299
files from the remote machine and bring

722
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,520
it locally that that isn't logged

723
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,559
unfortunately but we can see when files

724
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,440
are uploaded to the remote machine

725
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,020
command execution that's really the

726
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,220
thing that we really want to get into

727
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,860
and there is a little bit of artifacts

728
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
but this is where it gets a little bit

729
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,600
more difficult for us so looking at this

730
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,240
well command execution because this is

731
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,919
going to be a service it's installed is

732
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,880
Service uh is system excuse me

733
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,000
um well anything that we execute is

734
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,340
going to be implicated or ran as system

735
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,260
on the distant machine all right so from

736
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,020
a threat actor perspective that's great

737
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,360
from a incident responder well it's like

738
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,159
all right uh well

739
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,340
not necessarily a good thing uh but when

740
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,120
these actions get executed they don't

741
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,940
actually just execute in the perspective

742
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,340
of an interactive session right that we

743
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,720
can think of when we're in Python

744
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,360
Powershell or any other uh platform they

745
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,880
actually write scripts to the temp

746
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,279
directory execute them and then delete

747
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,640
them right so if we have the appropriate

748
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,399
login in place we could position

749
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,919
ourselves to be able to see what those

750
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,440
commands are now doing an incident

751
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,140
response we kind of just go into it

752
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,580
thinking that we're not going to have

753
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,440
those artifacts so we have to think

754
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,260
about what else can we have right so

755
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,480
let's look at this a little bit more

756
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,360
um what is logged is the length of the

757
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,220
command the length of the command and

758
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,960
this is what that log looks like we see

759
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,700
in this case the link of the command

760
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,080
executed was uh 657 and within connect

761
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,500
wise there's a number of built-in tasks

762
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,200
that literally if you click on them in

763
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
the background it will execute on the

764
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,899
remote machine on your behalf and those

765
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,380
commands are static in nature they don't

766
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,179
change so through a little bit of

767
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,820
research when it retrieves a process

768
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,799
list well that is 657 uh characters when

769
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,720
it tries to get a software listing

770
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,919
that's 861 and we see them kind of go on

771
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,860
and on so we can use this not as

772
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,740
something that's like concrete however

773
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,080
the chances of seeing a command that is

774
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,960
657 characters that isn't a process

775
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,580
listing

776
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,140
um probably a little bit more form few

777
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,940
so we can kind of err on the side of

778
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,520
caution in that perspective

779
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,880
um and then when we execute uh manual

780
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,279
commands like I just want to make my own

781
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,039
and execute it uh the same thing where

782
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,279
it lists the number of characters so one

783
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,260
thing I'll highlight here too is those

784
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,220
built-in tasks uh the services the yeah

785
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,039
the services processes updates things of

786
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:52,620
that nature those are executed from the

787
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,140
perspective of Powershell scripts so a

788
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,539
DOT PS1 gets written it gets executed

789
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,279
and then they delete it or it gets

790
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,179
deleted

791
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,940
anything that's manual in nature is

792
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,640
going to be a command script so a DOT

793
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,580
CMD gets written with whatever command

794
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,039
we want to execute and then it gets

795
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,080
deleted afterwards

796
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,059
I say that because now we're going to

797
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,519
show some of this web UI that an

798
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,500
attacker is leveraging it and what makes

799
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,840
this attractive to them so on the left

800
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,299
side we see whatever workstations are

801
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,159
checking into our tenant on the right

802
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,919
side we see essentially commands that we

803
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,740
can run at the ready and just clicking

804
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,080
on that icon that brings up my process

805
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,500
list on the right hand side so right off

806
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,179
the bat an attacker is able to get a

807
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:41,460
process list and we know that that's one

808
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,720
of the things that people want to do

809
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,919
once they get access they want to

810
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,480
understand what's running

811
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,980
um what they might have to bypass they

812
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,419
want to understand really some of the

813
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,100
makeup of the machine and they can get

814
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,440
this at any time right so it

815
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,720
automatically refreshes however they can

816
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,120
also near the the top of that right hand

817
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
side window they can also click the

818
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,380
refresh button

819
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,240
we could also do the same thing with

820
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,000
Services ports or Services updates and

821
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,620
event logs

822
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,080
now there's also like random information

823
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,080
that it retrieves almost like a sys info

824
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,699
so we see that they're getting the user

825
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,619
that's logged in we also have the

826
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,540
ability to get screenshots on a regular

827
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,540
interval this is all just happening or

828
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,659
the threat actor can make it run at that

829
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,859
time

830
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:28,560
when it comes to executing Powershell

831
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
commands that I mentioned that are

832
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,219
actually executed as command scripts

833
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,679
well we have a window where we can type

834
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,619
in whatever it is that we want in green

835
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,599
you can see the Powershell commands that

836
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,359
I typed in I needed to call upon uh that

837
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,060
Powershell uh binary and then my actual

838
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,619
Powershell command

839
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,780
and then from there I get the results

840
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,440
back

841
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,119
now in this case I did who am I that's

842
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,219
six characters so that's what I see in

843
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,619
the event log

844
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,720
the other thing we notice threat actors

845
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,619
doing is once their connect wise agent

846
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:07,320
gets installed and then calls back to

847
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,480
the tenant for the first time they'll

848
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,640
automatically have commands set up to

849
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,460
run upon initial check-in in this case

850
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,460
it's a net stat in other cases it's been

851
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,520
making other changes on a workstation so

852
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,500
these things are called triggers and it

853
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,500
utilizes and if then kind of syntax if

854
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,880
you will if this happens then do this so

855
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,099
there's three options they can have it

856
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,020
send an email right after they doing

857
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,480
that uh perform a web request I haven't

858
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,240
witnessed that or a session event

859
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,240
session event is where they can have a

860
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,760
specific action happen on the Target in

861
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,060
terms of an actual uh script uh being

862
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,460
run in this case we see them just doing

863
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,680
a net stat from a Powershell perspective

864
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,820
there's also this thing called backstage

865
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,859
mode when we think of connectwise we

866
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:02,220
think of a true interactive GUI like

867
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,000
session well they can also use backstage

868
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,099
and what that does is still connect to

869
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,619
the Target machine but it provides back

870
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:13,980
a command shell and a Powershell prompt

871
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,200
all running this system right so now

872
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,880
we're really not even messing with the

873
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,579
person who's actually logged in uh the

874
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,880
good thing about this is it is log the

875
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,520
bad thing is it doesn't differentiate

876
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,300
between the type of connection is that

877
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,700
is made like did you make a GUI like

878
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,220
connection or did you make a terminal

879
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,900
light connection that isn't

880
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,640
differentiated within the log

881
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,380
unfortunately

882
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,839
so when we're looking at the artifacts

883
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:44,700
that are available the application

884
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,339
itself has a substantial amount of logs

885
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,720
we just have to know what's available

886
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,180
and where they're at certainly our event

887
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,700
logs could be certainly useful for us if

888
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,460
configured appropriately I can't say

889
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,579
enough 46.88 is a substantial

890
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,920
specifically with command line arguments

891
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,800
being enabled and then we start to

892
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
understand the behavior specifically

893
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,900
with connect wise I mentioned that it

894
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,800
runs those PS1 and CMD files well if we

895
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,579
start to see either one of those being

896
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:19,079
labeled as part of a command line

897
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,020
argument and then linked to screen

898
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,780
connect well we can certainly insinuate

899
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,339
certain things that are going on and

900
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:28,440
then with the appropriate logging while

901
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,480
those scripts are being deleted we'll be

902
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,940
able to get the contents in the log

903
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,859
course and we certainly want to ship it

904
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:35,940
off somewhere we don't want to just

905
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,339
leave it locally as we all know so while

906
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,780
I mentioned some of those things that

907
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,780
are useful other standard artifacts are

908
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,300
still in play right so as these things

909
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,940
are are being written we still have

910
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,560
those other artifacts that are useful

911
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,880
for us

912
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,660
so being able to assist with this well

913
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,119
I've written a subset of Powershell

914
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,520
scripts to the tomb of roughly 30 that

915
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,339
parse these logs and make things user

916
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,800
friendly for you the analyst or meet the

917
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,780
analyst so we can get after the answers

918
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,480
that we're Desiring in this case we have

919
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,020
that log again just really vomit on the

920
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,300
screen when we utilize one of those

921
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,339
functions that I mentioned well we put

922
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:20,220
it together in a table like format in

923
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,619
CSV Json whatever you want but in this

924
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,839
case we're just CSV and now we can

925
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,420
answer a very specific questions what

926
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,000
are those specific questions well here's

927
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,339
a list but not all inclusive things that

928
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,660
I want to know when I'm leading an

929
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,760
investigation my boss wants to know and

930
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,740
most certainly the the organization that

931
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,420
I'm supporting would want to know what

932
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,460
type of outgoing connections were there

933
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,740
what IPS were the communicating with

934
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,040
what was the keyboard associated with

935
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,320
that connection specifically if you're

936
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,820
working in one region and you only

937
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,000
really use one language per se you

938
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,980
wouldn't expect any other one the

939
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,839
aeration associated with them was there

940
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,480
any tunneling going on were there any

941
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,119
fouls retrieved did they utilize the

942
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,619
utility

943
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,480
um option to be able to retrieve those

944
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,640
files or did they try to use like a copy

945
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,240
paste to bypass that straight up utility

946
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,460
recommendations well we want to

947
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,400
regularly audit these tools enable MFA

948
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,560
and a number of other things right to be

949
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,300
able to get that visibility

950
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,579
and really some of my future work really

951
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,980
going into this topic well I want to be

952
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,140
able to carve artifacts out of memory I

953
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,300
want to transform these Powershell

954
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,980
um capabilities in the sigma rule so

955
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,200
that way it's a little bit more widely

956
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,180
usable for other people that may not

957
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,460
like power kill or don't use it I want

958
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,320
to expand to other remote access tools

959
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,420
and certainly try to link some of the

960
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,119
IPS and Geo data associated with that

961
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,780
and the relays so with that being said I

962
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,280
certainly appreciate the opportunity to

963
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,800
speak appreciate everybody listening uh

964
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,020
I'll be here I'll look at slack and

965
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,000
answer any questions I recognize my time

966
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,920
has already passed however if you're

967
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,079
interested in those Powershell functions

968
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,880
that I mentioned you can grab them at

969
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,680
that site so thank you everybody I

970
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,990
appreciate it
