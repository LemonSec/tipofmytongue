1
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,480
Rob Lee:
Honestly, there was a discussion  

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,520
last night about Eric Kristensen's in the back 
back here and he was making fun of me because  

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,880
he was telling a story not two nights ago, well 
actually, yeah, it was two nights ago. Rob pretty  

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,640
much called me and told me to get into a car to 
drive down. And it wasn't like a telling thing, it  

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,280
was like he ordered me to get into a car because 
he didn't want me to drive at 4:00 AM to come down  

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,400
to the summits because last night's going to be 
a really late night. And the way he worded it  

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,239
was almost just like how I told Phil to get into 
this job, it's like, "Shut up and come over," to  

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,240
where we were working at that point in time.
All right, let me see if I can get over to the  

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:57,920
slides. Oh, there we are. So this talk kind 
of morphed from a very similar, Rob, and I'm  

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,920
looking a Viv here in the front row who also 
didn't really ask me to do the talk, it was a,  

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,880
"You will do this talk. You've never 
spoken at your event in the 15 years that  

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,039
you've run this summit and ever since we handed 
it over to Heather and Phil." I always find  

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,880
it weird to give a talk at the summit. So since 
it's been Heather and Phil's event over the  

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,360
past three years, Viv said, "Hey, what a better 
opportunity to now have you talk since it's no  

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,680
longer your event?" I was like, "Oh great." And I 
really appreciate the invite and happy to be here. 

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,479
This graphic, and again, the DFIR 
Godfather, I have to admit a little bit of  

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,760
a failure on my part over the years, I'm a big 
movie buff, but I had not seen The Godfather  

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,240
ever. I know. During COVID I had to rectify this 
issue. One of my good friends, Kate Marshall,  

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,160
made fun of me pretty hardcore because she did 
this graphic, and I told her, I said, "Admittedly,  

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,679
I'd never seen the godfather." I said, "I kind 
of get the reference, but..." She said you need  

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,600
to correct this right now. Within weeks I watched 
it. I said, "Oh, this is a really good movie." She  

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,400
said, "Don't watch Godfather II, watch Godfather 
I and II and you're pretty much done." I'm like,  

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,840
"All right." I did that. So Francis Ford Coppola, 
amazing filmmaker. Also, which I later found out  

24
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,080
watching this series on Disney+, Light & Magic, 
how the close relationship between George Lucas  

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,320
and Francis Ford Coppola, they developed their 
own studio, they had a really close relationship,  

26
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,760
and I say, how did I not know all these years 
about this being the big Star Wars fan that I am? 

27
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,560
So this presentation, everyone's really 
wanting to know, especially if you're brand new  

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,520
to digital forensics is like, how do you get your 
start? A lot of people come up to me. They say,  

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,360
"Rob, how do I beat you?" And I said, 
well, first of all, you need to laugh.  

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,640
And I said, that's really hard to replicate. I 
need to trademark it. Jennifer Santiago, who's  

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,959
one of the summit... She literally has this radar 
thing, it's like, where's Rob? She texted me,  

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,240
she said, "Where's Rob?" And I laughed and she 
said, "Found you." She opens up at the door and  

33
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,080
just points at me. But my laugh, you have to have 
a laugh, but no, that's really not what this is  

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,680
about. She's like, how to become someone to start 
in forensics? How do I start in cybersecurity?  

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,120
How do I get my first two steps into the field?
So instead of doing a 50 minute talk on this,  

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,040
I'm going to start off with the answer 
to this question. How do you do this?  

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,040
How do you get your start? Everyone know 
what the term BLUF is? This is the basic way,  

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,560
your first letter of success in any email 
exchange is, do the bottom line up front.  

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,679
Instead of writing a very lengthy email, you 
always do the bottom line up front. The three  

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,720
secrets of success in DFIR. Everyone ready? 
This is it. This is going to be the 10 minute  

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
presentation, boom, right here.
So number one,  

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,720
never stop learning. And again, for anyone who's 
new here, anyone who's been doing this for 20  

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:40,400
years, from Heather to Phil to anyone, from Brian 
Carrier to anyone who is a NASA scientist planning  

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,560
on the Mars missions, Elon Musk, I guarantee every 
single individual who's out there that you think  

45
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,599
that they're an expert in the field, I guarantee 
that every day they wake up and they're listening  

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,960
to podcasts, they're reading books, they 
are consistently learning something new.  

47
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,520
They're filling their lives with knowledge 
constantly, not only in digital forensics,  

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,159
not only in cyber security. It is constant 
absorption of data in some form or another. 

49
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,760
And I think a lot of you already know this, but 
again for those who are new, you may not know  

50
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,640
this. You've probably saying, "Hey, I didn't 
really realize that those who are at the top  

51
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:36,800
of their field are just like those who are new in 
their field, because for me, I'm looking at things  

52
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,520
that, I said I've always wanted to learn how to 
play the piano. I'm currently renting a house  

53
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,320
in the Denver area. I just moved to Denver a 
year ago and I somehow landed this amazing home,  

54
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,920
which is basically an Airbnb for a year. It's 
not an Airbnb, but the owners left to Sweden and  

55
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,000
basically left all their furniture in it, which is 
great because I don't have to buy any furniture,  

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,920
especially with the supply chain stuff that's 
going on right now, and there's a piano in the  

57
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,280
middle of it. I said, "No, maybe now's the time. 
There's this piano sitting here. I should look up  

58
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,480
some classes or maybe hire an instructor. 
There's a bunch of electronic apps." 

59
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,360
And of course, now that I say this, I guarantee 
two to three of you who've learned in the past  

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
couple years are going to come up and advise 
me on this. And this is also something else  

61
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,840
that when you learn, you find out there's 
a community out there of also self learners  

62
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,320
who have taught themselves or who have taken 
classes on these things that was like, "Here's  

63
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,599
how I learn." And this is one of the things that's 
great about it is that, okay, I'm now a learner,  

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
first-time individual going out there and learning 
how to play the piano. So how do you do that? 

65
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,520
But also the second piece of this is also 
very important as you're learning, be curious,  

66
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,160
not confident. Anyone who is an expert in their 
field will tell you that the more that you learn,  

67
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,600
the more that you learn what you don't 
know. Any expert in the field will always be  

68
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,000
aware of what they don't know 
more of what they do know.  

69
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:20,640
Sarah Edwards is good example of this, the Apple 
architecture, the Apple devices, the Apple stuff  

70
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:28,800
that she works on on a daily basis is so complex 
that if you throw her anything that is a new  

71
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,560
question at her, she will fully admit to you, 
she's like, "Well, I honestly don't know that."  

72
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
You would look at her, she's like, "Well, you're 
the expert on this. How do you not know this?" 

73
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
Where someone growing up in the field is like, 
"Well, I'm supposed to be the expert." Just  

74
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,919
you're going to throw down or say, "Well, this 
is what's written in the book. This is of course  

75
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,120
what you're supposed to know." And we draw this 
line, but an expert in the field will always say,  

76
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,880
"Well, even though the book is written this way, 
it may be wrong," or, "I did this research before,  

77
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,480
I might be wrong." Or maybe the standard has 
changed. It's always be curious, not confident in  

78
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,680
anything that you're doing.
Second thing to look at here,  

79
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,000
again in the bottom line up front here, 
is be kind in anything that you're doing.  

80
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,480
It's just a general approach out there. 
I've seen a lot of people in this field,  

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,599
anyone who runs around with a big chip on their 
shoulders and is not kind to others, I've never  

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:35,280
seen them succeed in this field ever. It is just 
a natural tendency that you could point these  

83
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,000
individuals out and anyone who's out there who 
is not kind to others while they're learning and  

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,160
while they are trying to explore, and this is one 
thing that I love about this community in general,  

85
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
and you don't see it across all the other 
communities that exist in cybersecurity  

86
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,640
is that this community in particular has 
a habit of welcoming those who are new.  

87
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,359
And I'm not going to point out other communities 
that I have an opinion of that they're much more,  

88
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,280
they have a defensive wall around it that you 
have to prove yourself to get into it and if you  

89
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,040
don't prove yourself, they troll you a little 
bit until you get to the point where you could  

90
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,920
get in and then you're allowed in to hang 
with those with leather jackets and the T-bird  

91
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,040
motorcycle gang on the back.
In the forensics community, you could go  

92
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,319
to Recess Arcade and someone says, "I'm brand new. 
I don't know what the heck I'm doing." It's like,  

93
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,360
"Oh, come on in. Let's go do Jenga together. I 
don't know what I'm doing either, but I've been  

94
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,720
doing it for 10 years." It's amazing and that's 
the thing that across the board that I would love  

95
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,400
to tear down those walls in the other communities 
with this be kind message, which is, we're all new  

96
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:57,199
and we're all new all the time. Be kind.
The third one, the best, and everyone you think  

97
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,680
is the best, and you know who we are, because some 
of you say, "Well, I think they're all clique-ish,  

98
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,560
they're all hanging out together." You kind of 
have this fanboy, fangirl approach to some of us.  

99
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:16,000
The best are not as good as you think they are. 
We're human. We're your peers. We are actually  

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
your peers in most of this stuff. Come up to 
us and if you actually treat us like your peer,  

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,680
we actually will treat you as your peer too. Most 
of us are 100% human beings in all of this stuff  

102
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,040
and most of the things that, if you start doing 
your research and you start asking questions,  

103
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,280
we're sitting down having a drink with you and 
all of a sudden a year from now you're like, "Wow,  

104
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,880
I don't how it happened but I'm friends with 
Brian Moran. I'm hanging out with this dude." 

105
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
And all of a sudden, everyone's like, "What?"  

106
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,480
This is why this community works, in forensics, in 
cybersecurity is that as soon as you stop thinking  

107
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,240
that the best are somehow segmented 
off, the best are just human beings,  

108
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,079
just gave a talk at some point. So everyone out 
there thinks you can't be on the stage within a  

109
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,200
year, you're wrong. You could come do a little 
bit of research and all of a sudden you're up  

110
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,400
on the stage thinking about things.
All right. So that's the BLUF,  

111
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,959
that's the secret. How do you do what you do? 
It's those three things. Now, I'm going to take a  

112
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,720
step back in time and talk about how did I get to 
those three things and take a little bit expanded  

113
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,880
view in the TL;DR for this stuff as well.
So the TL;DR and a little bit about my origin  

114
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,240
story, which is again, if you read the background 
to who I am and how I got to be here a little bit  

115
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,360
is, again, this conference, the summit in 
general, 15 years, again now I feel really old,  

116
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,320
15 years. I remember when I went to my 10 year 
high school reunion and I was like, "Wow, I am  

117
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:59,200
fricking old at my 10 year high school reunion." 
And now I've been at this event for 15 years  

118
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,480
in a row and I look at the pictures back 
then. I was like, "Man, I was hot back then."  

119
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,400
And now I'm like, what the hell happened? I 
know, things go downhill quick, but do I feel  

120
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,120
any smarter 15 years later? Absolutely not. Do 
I feel that somehow I have some more technical  

121
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:28,320
prowess than I did 15 years ago? No, things have 
rapidly changed. I am still the same individual,  

122
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,400
maybe in terms of what I'm doing, my passions 
have changed, the people I'm hanging out with,  

123
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,160
by and large in some cases, some of them 
are the same group, some of them have  

124
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,880
changed over the years, the group has expanded.
But some of the things that I'm going to tell you  

125
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,520
here are some of the core truths that have hung 
with me over the years. What I'm doing though  

126
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,960
has changed and what I'm doing at SANS has changed 
over the years too. So some of these core truths  

127
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,080
in terms of what makes me an individual and 
what I'm going to tie into some of the themes of  

128
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,000
why I'm going to impart some of these lessons to 
those who are new to the cybersecurity field here  

129
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,640
also ring true because things are not as easy 
as you think they are when you're just starting  

130
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,720
out. I've had a couple conversations with my 
son and my daughter and those who are also  

131
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,520
just starting out. And one of these 
conversations that I've had most recently,  

132
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,400
a lot of people get on my case about this is, 
should people go to college? This is one of those.  

133
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,720
My son's like, "What should I major in college?" 
I'm like, "Dude, you're 10." I'm like, "This is  

134
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,920
not something you need to worry about right now."
My daughter has no interest in this. Right now,  

135
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,319
she's just like, "Okay, I want to play Roblox." 
I'm like, "Okay, cool." She's going to major in  

136
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,680
Roblox and do very well at this. But my son 
is like, "How do you know what you want to be  

137
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,199
when you grow up?" And I said, "Honestly, you 
don't. What you need to do right now is focus  

138
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,440
in on the things that make you happy, the 
things that you find your passion," this  

139
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,560
is going to be a theme out there that you're 
going to focus in on. But I also started to  

140
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,599
tell them. I said, "But you also need to take a 
look at things that you sign up for, you should  

141
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,400
commit yourself to completing those things. If 
you sign up for soccer, you should go to the  

142
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,880
practices, you should go to the games, we should 
complete the season. And at the end of the season,  

143
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,640
you should make a decision at that point whether 
or not you're going to do the next season." 

144
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,439
And I know some of the times you're waking up in 
the morning, it's hard. You're like, "Oh, it's  

145
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,280
early morning game." Hockey practice, especially 
if you're a hockey dad, you're getting up, some of  

146
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,120
those games are really early in the morning. And 
of course, trying to drag your son or daughter out  

147
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,120
of bed at those times is not fun and they don't 
want to do it. I said, "You made a commitment to  

148
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,240
this." And this goes back to this thing here, 
where, when I was in high school, there was  

149
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,360
a lesson I learned, this ties in to where it's 
going to be for you as well, one of the things I  

150
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,960
am going to recommend here is that when you 
commit to something, you have to carry it through. 

151
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,320
And this is like, if you start to learn something, 
at least get to a point of self mastery for this.  

152
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:22,960
For my story is the heart side. For anyone who 
started Boy Scouts, the Life Scout emblem is  

153
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,240
the heart. Is anyone familiar with Boy Scouts? 
It is the heart symbol is the Life Scout. And I  

154
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:41,680
was two requirements away from becoming an Eagle 
Scout, just two, and high school hit and life hit  

155
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,640
and I basically stopped. A lot of reasons why I 
looked back at it, but it was one of those things  

156
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:54,720
that I went back and I looked, I have my book 
still from the Boy Scouts and I thumbed through  

157
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,400
it and I look at those two requirements and they 
were super easy, maybe two weeks' worth of time.  

158
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,120
That's it and then a board to get my Eagle Scout.
To this day, you sit there, everyone has this no  

159
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,320
regrets thing in life, but this is 
a regret of mine. And what's that?

160
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,401
Speaker 2:
[inaudible 00:16:17].

161
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:22,079
Rob Lee:
I don't think so. 18. I could do it mentally,  

162
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,280
I've got my Eagle Scout, but you got to get it 
done by 18. I got my Eagle Scout, but again,  

163
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,880
it's like can't do it. It's like you have to do it 
by 18. And so as a result of that, I sit there and  

164
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
look at that, I was like, "Man, I should have 
done it. Why didn't I do it?" Life gets in the  

165
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,960
way of these things and I should have followed 
through. It's that follow through that sometimes  

166
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,400
is that lesson that we have to take a look at 
when we're walking through life at this point. 

167
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,000
So, around that point in time, and around the 
point, 18 happened, I looked back and I said,  

168
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,480
"Oh, I should have done it." That was 
that regret that set in at that point.  

169
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
And I made a decision at that point saying, 
"Okay, that's not going to happen again.  

170
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,920
When I commit to something, I'm going to try 
and finish, at least get the follow through,  

171
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,839
and then look back and make a decision." For 
a lot of people that know me, this has become  

172
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,319
either a curse or a blessing is that I will 
stick with something to the end and then make  

173
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:28,240
a decision whether or not I'm going to either cut 
or continue. Cut or continue and whether or not... 

174
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,960
And again, anything is hard in life, this is again 
whether you're working out, a lot of people who've  

175
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,960
been with me a while, I actually call this thing 
when you're just starting to run and work out,  

176
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,680
and for anyone who's known me for many years, 
I used to be really big and when you're first  

177
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,320
running, you have this thing that hits you 
that says, "You should stop running now."  

178
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,920
And your mind is telling stop, run, stop, run, 
stop, run, stop, run, stop, run, until all of a  

179
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,480
sudden you get through it and all of a sudden your 
mind is like, "Okay, this is actually okay." And  

180
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
now you could run for about 30, 40, 50 minutes and 
then you could actually run even longer than that.  

181
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,360
A lot of people call this the shit 
shift, excuse my language, but  

182
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,679
that's actually a term, you can Google it.
Getting through that shit shift  

183
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:23,920
is a very interesting point in not just working 
out and running, but that shit shift occurs in  

184
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:30,080
many different locations in learning in your 
jobs, in personal relationships across the board,  

185
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,480
that there's an uncomfortable 
hill and hump you need to get over  

186
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,320
to where you get to comfort again. And that's 
where a lot of people, where you get stuck,  

187
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,040
ends up being. It's like, are you going 
to quit or continue? And that's where  

188
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,240
that comes in. It's like, are you 
going to be able to get over that hump? 

189
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,120
And so this is where, for me, I always tell 
people who are just starting out saying,  

190
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,719
"Don't forget how important it is to get through 
that initial hump," because if you don't,  

191
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
there's always going to be this look 
back and saying, "Did I quit too early?  

192
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,440
Or did I not have the follow through?" And that's 
what I'm trying to tell my son and my kids. It's  

193
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,720
like, if you sign up for something, you have to 
commit to it through the end of the season, then  

194
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
you can make a decision on whether you're going to 
do it for next season or not. And I'm like, okay,  

195
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,000
at that point we can make the call, 
not until. Maybe I'm just a mean dad.  

196
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
I don't know. But at that point we'll make a call.
Now school, that's not a question. It's like,  

197
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,120
okay, end of third grade, well am I 
going to go to fourth grade? Okay.  

198
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,720
Some of these things, maybe the college 
decision may be a part of that. I said,  

199
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,120
"We may have some questions there," because 
for a lot of us out there, do we need to have  

200
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,479
college for a cybersecurity degree? Some 
of the stuff is technical trade stuff. 

201
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,400
This next thing that comes up is this 
thing that you're not good enough.  

202
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,240
When I was at the Air Force Academy, and this is 
where when you're just starting out something new,  

203
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,360
I was recruited into basically the first 
cyber unit in doing information security  

204
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,040
that didn't exist, no one knew what the heck 
we were doing. There was a single book that  

205
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,840
existed on the planet, James Bafford's Practical 
Internet and [inaudible 00:20:17] Security Book.  

206
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,680
This is a real throwback. Has anyone 
even heard of this book? It's a yellow  

207
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,000
O'Reilly book. It existed back in 1995. This thing 
was the only book that I could find other than  

208
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:38,080
TCP/IP Illustrated Volume II.
And I was scared beyond belief that I  

209
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:45,040
was recruited into this unit because I apparently 
knew how to spoof email and people knew it  

210
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,000
and they were like, "Okay, because you knew how to 
spoof email, we're recruiting you into this unit  

211
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,760
who apparently they think you know what you're 
doing on how to defend entire Air Force bases  

212
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,160
from internet based attack and all these scary 
hackers." My eyes go wide here. And of course  

213
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,240
they knew no one knew what they were doing 
at this point, but there was this aspect of  

214
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,000
it that they thought I knew what I was 
supposed to be doing. So I was scared. 

215
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,880
So this false expectations, which is what 
the acronym stands for, false expectations  

216
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,760
appearing real, is this fear that sets in that 
you are not good enough because you don't know  

217
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,920
what you're doing. The key here is no one 
knows what they're doing, that is around you.  

218
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,000
We're all winging it. But again, you think 
everyone else around you knows what they're doing.  

219
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,639
No one knows what they're doing, not just in your 
career, but in life. By the way, your boss doesn't  

220
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,240
know what they're doing either. The executives 
don't know what they're doing. Everyone's kind of  

221
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,520
winging it. They have a little bit more knowledge 
than you in certain areas, but it's true when you  

222
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,400
end up taking a look at it, it's like a lot of the 
things that are being done around you is a lot of  

223
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:06,080
decent guesswork and in some cases it's a lot of 
education and things around you, but a lot of this  

224
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,760
stuff where the fear comes in and why I'm tying 
this back into these stories is that when you  

225
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,080
end up starting something new, especially in your 
careers, is that it is okay to feel inadequate. 

226
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,000
And this ties into the next phase of the story 
because those two things in my origin tie in to  

227
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:35,520
when I got recruited by SANS, I had, like many of 
you, I met Ed Skoudis, I met Eric Cole. I had this  

228
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,879
massive fanboy, "I am finally learning how to do 
internet security and all this other stuff." And  

229
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,800
I started taking SANS classes and then I started 
teaching SANS classes and authoring SANS classes.  

230
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,440
And when that happened, there's something 
else that occurred, and this is where  

231
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,120
the things I wish I actually 
learned in the SANS class kicks in. 

232
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,080
So here's, you take SANS classes, all 
the technical stuff that's out there,  

233
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,720
here's where we're going to start diving into 
where the BLUF comes in, bottom line upfront,  

234
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,200
but the actual things that, and this comes 
from, if anyone's familiar with the book,  

235
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
Everything You Need to Know in Life, They Taught 
You in Kindergarten. It's a book by Robert Fulghum  

236
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,840
that came out during the mid 90s. It's an amazing 
book, by the way, it still resonates today,  

237
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,080
but it's very similar to this, 
that everything you actually  

238
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,600
wish they taught you in a SANS class but 
didn't, it's on the non-technical stuff. 

239
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,960
So the first thing is that there needs to be, 
in every SANS class, a section on the imposter  

240
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:45,760
syndrome, which ties into that fear. The first 
thing I'm going to mention to you is that you,  

241
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,400
like everyone else out there, is constantly 
challenged with the imposter syndrome,  

242
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,320
which is everyone is worried and consistently 
challenged that you are not good enough  

243
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:09,439
to wear the shoes. And the shoes basically ties 
into this theory that, why I use this shoe analogy  

244
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:17,280
is for anyone who is going to be wearing, and 
I use the shoe analogy like dance shoes. If  

245
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,560
you're going to be out on the dance floor and 
you're going to have dance shoes on, therefore  

246
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:28,879
you know how to dance. But in order to learn 
how to dance, you need to have dance shoes on. 

247
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,680
This becomes a catch-22, because if you 
put the shoes on, people assume you know  

248
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,720
what you're doing, but you don't want to put 
your shoes on because you don't want to have  

249
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
the shoes on because then people assume 
you see what's going on here now,  

250
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,840
but you need to equip yourself in 
order to be able to do it correctly.  

251
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:53,040
So if you show up, let's assume you walk 
out to, I'm going to go learn how to climb a  

252
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,919
wall. In order to do that safely, you have to have 
all of the equipment, safety equipment, ropes,  

253
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,639
the clips, and everything else. So if 
you walk out there with all that gear on  

254
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,840
and you show up at that wall, I mean you're 
going to look like pretty much of a badass  

255
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,920
and anyone who doesn't know any differently, 
and never climbed a wall before, guess what,  

256
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,680
they're going to look at you and saying, "Hey, 
you look like you've done this for a while."  

257
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,360
Kind of like, "No, no serious. Don't talk to me."
This is the problem with the imposter syndrome is  

258
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,439
you feel that someone's going to actually ask 
you a question about it. And everyone has the  

259
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,680
same issue is that everyone is sitting in this 
bucket and it's okay. You almost got to relish in  

260
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,800
the fact that no one knows what they're doing. And 
ask questions, and you're in that learning stage.  

261
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,000
Guaranteed doctors, lawyers, judges, I mean you 
got to think people on the Supreme Court go on on  

262
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,200
day one and they don't have the FMG status, Google 
that if you don't, I'm not going to acronym that  

263
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,040
for you. I mean you got to think, hey, your first 
day on Supreme Court, you do not get that label,  

264
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:13,040
I guarantee they do. That first day, it's like, 
go, "First case?" "Yeah." "Nervous?" "Yep."  

265
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,000
"Everyone does."
This is where that imposter  

266
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,160
syndrome comes into play here. And it's amazing 
when you end up thinking about it, equip yourself,  

267
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:31,200
regardless if you think you deserve 
the shoes or not. Go buy the equipment,  

268
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,640
don't hold yourself back. Now the equipment 
may be expensive or not, then rent it,  

269
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,800
buy it from someone else. But again, 
always equip yourself with the stuff,  

270
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,240
even if you think someone's going to judge 
you for it that you have not earned it yet.  

271
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,320
Equip yourself with the right stuff in order to 
learn the job properly in all instances. That's  

272
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,840
a good recommendation in general, because if 
you don't, how are you going to learn properly?  

273
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,600
Arm yourself with the right equipment.
I can tell you, what does the equipment  

274
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,800
list say you have, Rob? It depends on 
what you really need to do for your job  

275
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,199
at that point. But again, I see time and 
time again, it's like, I have not earned...  

276
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,840
It's like the movies have this 
big dramatic thing about this, the  

277
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,840
superhero earning this uniform and the Batarang 
at the right point in the movie or the sword,  

278
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,840
that's all BS. What you need to do is go right 
out the door and say, "What do I need to be  

279
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,159
able to do this now and how do I learn using the 
equipment that I will be using in my day job?"  

280
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,399
It's super important that you start using the 
equipment now, not what you will be using later.  

281
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,879
Even if you have to borrow it, borrow it from 
a friend. It's like, "What are you using there?  

282
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:52,080
Okay. Can I use that?" And go forward with that.
Breaking glass and rules. So,  

283
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,520
this one's interesting because you have to take 
a step back that in this field, this one comes up  

284
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,440
quite frequently, and I'll give you an analogy 
first before I dive into how messed up digital  

285
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,840
forensics is in general about rules, because 
we are layered with rules in general, but  

286
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,880
not more than two nights ago. Again, a story 
about my son. He watches, I'm paying a bill  

287
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,879
and they bring out the card reader and stick the 
card in and they hand it back to me and said,  

288
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
"We need your signature." And I put my 
signature in, we're walking down the street,  

289
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,520
after I put my signature in, he asked me a 
question, "Dad, how do I get a signature?"  

290
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,479
And I said, "Well, you have a signature. Spell it, 
C-O-N-N-O-R." He said, "Yes, I know, but how do I  

291
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,360
get a signature?" I said, "You have a signature." 
This is going back and forth several times here,  

292
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,679
"You have a signature." He said, "No, 
you don't understand. How do I obtain  

293
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:04,640
a signature that you could use in the reader?"
So what he's thinking is going on is that there's  

294
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:14,480
some universal signature checker somewhere up in 
the cloud somewhere that is checking my signature  

295
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:22,640
from what I put in. Now, everyone in here knows 
I could do that as my signature and that counts.  

296
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:30,880
He's wanting to know how he could get his 
signature registered into the cloud so when  

297
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:40,000
he signs something, it'll also check. And I said, 
"It doesn't exist." And he's, "Why do we do it?  

298
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:50,480
Why are we doing something called a signature?" I 
had to stop there and I said, "Because we do it." 

299
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:00,480
And then I had to explain, I said, "Okay." Let me 
take my mobile device out and I said, when I take  

300
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,320
a picture, and I turn the sound on, when I take a 
picture, do you know why it makes that sound? No.  

301
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,360
I had to explain the sound of the camera. I was 
like there's no reason that sound exists other  

302
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:23,439
than back in the 50s, this film thing existed. 
We are sometimes sitting on the reason we do  

303
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,720
something no longer makes sense other than it's 
because of the way we used to do something.  

304
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,600
Signatures, as we all know, are one of 
those things. It's 100% security theater,  

305
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,520
we all know it, and everyone in here makes 
fun of it. The people at the party are like,  

306
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,560
"Yeah, signatures." We all tell our backstory 
on that and it was like, "It doesn't matter." 

307
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,159
Chip and card readers, we have our 
little thing we talk about it. But  

308
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,280
the reason I talk about the break glass 
stuff here, especially when you are new,  

309
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,360
guess what, you have new eyes on things like no 
one else. You are my son. You are like my son at  

310
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,479
that point, you're asking why are you doing that? 
You are asking the question, why do you do MD5  

311
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,040
and [inaudible 00:31:10] sums for evidence 
hashing? Why both? Why does that make sense?  

312
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,600
Why do we... "Well, it's because we all..." 
Why? That is amazing perception to be able to  

313
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,080
ask at that point, to ask the why question.
Now, I also noticed out here during break,  

314
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:40,399
everyone lined up to get the stickers. Why? 
There was no... Was there a sign of rules out  

315
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,960
there that said you have to form a line to go 
get the stickers and the little key chains? Or  

316
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,480
just there's some generic rule thing that someone 
said, "Hey, this is a really nice way to do it?"  

317
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,520
Or if you really wanted to, you could go up 
there and stick your hand between the people,  

318
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,879
grab some stickers and claw them 
out like the claw from Toy Story.  

319
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,040
I mean this is the kind of thing 
when it comes into when you're new,  

320
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,520
are we following a set of rules because there's 
this default set of gentleman's, ladies' rules  

321
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,000
in an environment? Or when we're in a career 
field, we're told these are the rules you must  

322
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,640
follow because someone else set the rules a 
long time ago and we must follow the rules? 

323
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,399
My advice for everyone in here, when you're 
looking at rules in general, break glass  

324
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,200
with an explanation point. Don't break 
glass to the point where you get in trouble,  

325
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,320
but break glass to the point where 
you will be able to look at something  

326
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,080
and saying, like my son, "Why are 
we actually doing this signature?"  

327
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,200
Because you're new you're going to have that new 
perception that no one else has. Break the glass,  

328
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,640
challenge the rules when you can, and you're going 
to be able to be that new person to nudge things  

329
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,320
into new directions. Those of us who have been 
in the field for 20 years cannot perceive things  

330
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,360
because we've been doing it, we're the old 
school folks. It's one of the reasons they  

331
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,240
make fun of the boomers, and now we make fun of 
the millennials, and the Gen Z-ers that could be  

332
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,840
made fun of here soon. Everyone who's the old 
school folks is the old way of doing things. 

333
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,439
I look at some of the Gen Z-ers these days who are 
like, "Why do I need to get a driver's license?"  

334
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,480
It is a serious question. Why get a 
driver's license? It's like, "Well,  

335
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,720
it's what you're supposed to do at 16." Why? I 
don't need a driver's license. Anytime I need  

336
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,840
to get somewhere, I could just Uber, whatever. 
What's the point? It's a new way of thinking.  

337
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,919
[inaudible 00:33:53] I hadn't considered 
that. Some of the things of what we're  

338
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,520
challenging society today is that breaking rules 
needs to be adhered to, so break the rules,  

339
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,840
especially if you're brand new. You are 
sitting on top of something really special,  

340
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:12,320
don't worry about it at that point, have that 
perception no one else has. Break the rules. 

341
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:22,400
Chad. So, taking a stop here for a 
second, everyone needs to think about  

342
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,240
my friend, Chad. I have to figure out 
which one I drink out of here. So Chad  

343
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:43,280
is my co-author FOR500 and 508. And back, I 
would say 2007, I started talking to Chad Tilbury  

344
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:56,719
about helping me co-author 508. And it took, 
I think, two years of conversations with him  

345
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,120
until he finally, and again, I don't even know 
where Phil's in back here, Chad, unlike Phil,  

346
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:14,720
Phil immediately said, "Yes, I'll come on board." 
Chad was a very long... It took him a while until  

347
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,759
he finally said, "Okay, I'll consider it."
And then he came on board and was my co-author  

348
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,680
FOR508 and then eventually became my co-author 
FOR500. And the reason I mention Chad  

349
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:37,200
is that you can't do things in a vacuum. It's not 
just about you. It's every time that I look back,  

350
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,640
the one single piece of advice I always tell 
people is figure out who your partners are,  

351
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,600
who is your team, who are the ones that 
you're going to be working closely with? And  

352
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,440
I guarantee the team and the people that you 
work with are going to be the same people  

353
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,879
that are going to be surrounding 
you for the next 15 to 20 years,  

354
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,880
professionally, personally, they're going to 
be in your orbit for a long period of time. 

355
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,279
And you see these people, again, bounce around. 
Sometimes they'll disappear for five years,  

356
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,560
they'll come back. And a lot of these 
folks that are out there end up primarily  

357
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,720
being significant contributors, personal and 
professionally inside, and being your greatest  

358
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,799
supporters and helpers across the board. Chad's 
one of those. Both of those courses would not be  

359
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,800
what they are today without Chad's influence. 
So to a certain extent, he is the was to those  

360
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,360
products. And granted, a lot of people credit 
me for 500 and 508 because I help essentially  

361
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:55,280
substantiate and create them, but without Chad's 
diligence and working on them, neither of those  

362
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,600
products would be the success they are 
today without Chad working with me on them. 

363
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:10,320
And that's one of the significant portions, I 
had to give a lot of credit to, who is your Chad  

364
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,480
when you're going through this process of being 
new and starting out out there? Who do you work  

365
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,720
with? Who's going to be your partner? It's 
not like all of a sudden I need to go find,  

366
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,520
start now, but when you're looking out there 
and you're starting to really figure out who  

367
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,840
you're resonating with and who is your natural 
partners, who do you call on a daily basis?  

368
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,160
And it's not just Chad that has 
ended up being a part of my team.  

369
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,520
I have many others that are out there and 
you see them across the board here inside  

370
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,520
my circle of folks out there. And a lot of 
the people are sitting in the audience here,  

371
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:00,560
some my family, some are... Whoop, let me go back 
one. So you can see the name. They all become  

372
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,720
your team. And obviously there's actually about 
50 people I could probably add to this slide,  

373
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,799
but I intentionally added a lot of people I 
knew would be here in this room and online. 

374
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,200
But the reason I specifically mentioned Chad is 
because he became for years directly attributable  

375
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,000
to the SANS product that I worked on, FOR508 
and 500, but then also directly associated  

376
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:35,840
with the summit with Heather and Phil, Kate, 
Viviana, Lee Woodfield, Dennis Scandrett, advice  

377
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:44,240
from my sister, Melinda. She might be watching 
online. A lot of these folks that I constantly  

378
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:57,680
lean on for day to day what goes on in Rob's 
head, it's not just what I do is attributable to  

379
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,800
how I function is saying, Rob just 
somehow does stuff. Honestly, it's  

380
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:14,640
mostly them. I mean I hate to tell you that 
half the things that I have an idea, and  

381
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,240
that idea might be just like, "Well, 
here's a stupid idea," and Phil might say,  

382
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,520
"Percolate on that and then actually come up 
with the actual idea." And then we end up doing  

383
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,360
executing on it or Heather, the same thing, or 
Kate, all of these things that come out of it. 

384
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Eric Christensen, who's sitting in the back back 
there, he's another one that he sat in my class,  

385
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,600
and his name's up on this chart too, I would 
say 10 years ago, and he started talking to me  

386
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:53,200
about the SIFT workstation and saying, "Rob, 
you're doing it all wrong." It's literally,  

387
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,240
you should do docker packages, you should do this, 
you should do that. And I just looked at him and I  

388
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:08,560
said, "Can I employ you to 99 you? I could use 
some help on this thing." He said, "Sure. I would  

389
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,200
do it for free." I'm like, "No, no, no. Let's just 
figure out a way to have you start working." And  

390
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:21,359
he became the engineer behind SIFT and was doing 
it for many, many, many years. And again, Eric,  

391
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,160
I don't know, everyone turn around and look at 
Eric, so he is the man behind SIFT right there. 

392
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:35,040
Eric now works at SANS, he's our chief engineer 
of all ranges and basically is engineering the  

393
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,840
entire scalable interface of how we're powering 
SANS courseware in the cloud. And that's how some  

394
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,360
of that stuff happens. A single conversation of 
an individual coming up to you and saying, "Hey,  

395
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,920
I have an idea about how to do 
docker packages and a virtual machine  

396
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:03,360
that I happen to do this in my other job." A 
relationship that you form because of a single  

397
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:09,200
conversation, because of an idea, forms 
a relationship, forms a friendship, forms  

398
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:18,240
a partnership, and forms a lifelong connection.
And Eric also loves Legos, loves Marvel, really  

399
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,560
good dude. And now he is working with Phil and 
I, and sit there and look at him, just sit there,  

400
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,920
have a conversation with him, you'd just be 
blown away about the amount of knowledge a guy  

401
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,160
has him on that stuff. But each one of these 
individuals has their own backstory with me  

402
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,880
that I would be able to bring to the forefront. 
And Chad also is, like I said, you have  

403
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,160
a very similar story with Chad when there's 
the contributions of 500 and 508 along the way. 

404
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,560
So next one. Going to take a pause here for 
a second. So find your team, but this one  

405
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:04,000
is very important as well. And this one, I find 
giving a lot of advice on to people mid-career,  

406
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:15,840
not when you're new, but when you're kind 
of 10 years in that you get this stuck mode.  

407
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,080
You reach this point in your career 
where you're saying, "I'm really not  

408
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:28,240
doing what I thought I'd be doing. I'm kind of 
meh." It's the old adage, and I'll have to say,  

409
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,280
I was kind of torn on the way to describe this. 
Is it stress? Is it kind of unhappy? But the  

410
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,560
meme that a lot of us who describe this is the 
dog with the coffee cup, the, "It's fine" meme.  

411
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,760
You know what I'm talking about? It's like, "Yeah,  

412
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,280
it's fine." You're just sipping coffee. 
There's a fire burning around you. I'm good,  

413
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,600
I think. And you're just content, 
but you're realizing you're not okay. 

414
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,720
Versus waking up every day and saying, "I 
love my job. I love what I do. And I love  

415
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,480
who I'm interacting with." So case in point 
with what I'm now doing at SANS. I don't know  

416
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,840
if a lot of you have realized this that SANS 
right now, that I've moved away from teaching.  

417
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,760
They asked me two years ago to move from the 
DFIR curriculum lead position and I'm now  

418
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,640
helping lead all of the curriculum in a 
leadership position. So all the cloud,  

419
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,040
digital forensics, office operations, all 
the curriculum leads, curriculum directors,  

420
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,880
all the content now roll under me. And it's a big 
change for me and I was really worried that I was  

421
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,800
going to lose my passion because I loved my job 
running digital forensics in its response at SANS. 

422
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,799
And you worry about, anytime you make a big 
shift like that, it's like, am I going to lose  

423
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,120
my passion? But another passion of mine has always 
been leading teams and leading content in the SANS  

424
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:04,720
dream of affecting cyber security in the right 
way. And I also look at things, like I said, could  

425
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,160
someone else do that job? Could they... I had 
that ego thing in there a little bit, it's like,  

426
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,839
well, what if someone else is doing it 
not as good as what I could possibly do?  

427
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,920
I said, "I don't know." I was like, "I think I 
could do a good job maybe. I don't know. I think  

428
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,280
I'd like to do that job. I'd like to be given 
a shot at that job. I hope I'm doing it well." 

429
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,240
But again, there's this passion of mine that 
says, "I want to wake up every morning and not  

430
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,319
just affect digital forensics, but affect all of 
the content that SANS is delivering worldwide."  

431
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,720
And that's my job right now and I love it. I 
can't believe they pay me for this. Of course,  

432
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,240
my boss might be watching on screen right now is 
like, "Good to know, Rob," writes that down, but  

433
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,400
I love what I do. And now every job out there 
has its stresses and your eye roll moments and  

434
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,839
the grass is greener on the other side but SANS  

435
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,360
has a promise, the most trusted source 
of information security certifications. I  

436
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,400
believe in this mission of what we do. The 
most trusted source, and I believe that. 

437
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,960
We have this mission that we're trying to 
accomplish. Now, if I didn't believe that mission  

438
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:23,360
and I was in a, "Nah, it's fine." I'd wake up 
every day, kind of stare at things, not really  

439
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:29,920
sure what the mission is, not really sure what my 
why of why I'm doing this. If you're in that role,  

440
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
and this is where I advise people, I have people 
call me out of the blue, have people that I work  

441
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,680
with sometimes say, "I'm not really sure that I 
see what I'm doing anymore." That's where I get  

442
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:48,879
a little bit concerned, and have you lost your own 
personal why of what you're trying to accomplish? 

443
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,920
And that's if you're brand new and maybe you need 
that new brand new moment to your own career field  

444
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,720
of what you're trying to accomplish, your own 
personal why that we're trying to accomplish. So  

445
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,160
it's the it's fine versus your own passion. You 
need to try and find your passion. And this is  

446
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,120
something too. If you want to reach out to me, 
you are in that situation, I'm glad to try and  

447
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,319
talk to you about it. Find me in the hallway. 
This is something that it's a personal thing  

448
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,480
that sometimes people need that, let's talk about 
it. It's hard to unbox that a little bit because  

449
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,080
sometimes what's affecting you is actually 
not your job, it's other things. But again,  

450
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,480
that's where I'm like, "Hey, you need to go talk 
to someone else when you find that out." If it's  

451
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:42,640
your job, sometimes you need to redirect and find 
out it's not the fact that you're doing the... 

452
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,839
Well, let me refactor that. Sometimes people got 
promoted and they're doing the wrong job suddenly,  

453
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:59,840
and this is where a good friend of mine, 
Laura Dawson, we keep on asking her, I said,  

454
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,120
"Do you want to get promoted?" She's like, 
"No. I'm perfectly fine in the job I'm in."  

455
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,839
And we're shocked. She's like, "No, actually, this 
is the job I like doing. I'm very passionate about  

456
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,440
my job." And I said, "Well, don't you want 
additional money? Do you not want additional  

457
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,400
time? Authority? All these other things?" She 
was like, "No, I actually don't." It's like,  

458
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,960
"The money, I'm able to live comfortably." "Well, 
what about cost of living?" And she's like, "Well,  

459
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,720
that sounds like something that you need to 
worry about to make sure that I'm going to  

460
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,839
be happy at my job." I'm like, again, some 
of this stuff comes from, there's a TikTok  

461
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:41,520
that came out that actually had some of these 
themes in it too, that we sent to her as like,  

462
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,080
"This sounds just like you." And she's 
like, "Oh yeah, that's definitely me." 

463
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,839
And it ties into this theme that sometimes 
you don't need to be promoted to be happy.  

464
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,880
Sometimes you just need to realize that 
happiness comes from understanding that  

465
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,960
your own personal happiness doesn't come 
from getting promoted and getting into,  

466
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,760
"Hey, I'm going to be getting my 
teeth kicked in at a new position."  

467
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,320
But realizing, every time I work out, my 
passion is actually working next to the  

468
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,880
people I love on a daily basis, but it always 
comes into this. You reach that certain age,  

469
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,880
you're like, "I have 10 years to do it. If I don't 
do it in the next 10 years, now what?" And this is  

470
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,440
where that, what would Chad do? Because Chad 
and I have these conversations all the time. 

471
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,480
Chad is one of these individuals that honestly he 
could have done a startup, he could have become a  

472
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,840
CEO of all these other industries, but he has 
had conversations with me and he says, "Rob,  

473
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,840
we live comfortably. We get to 
go on a couple vacations a year.  

474
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:57,200
We get to talk on the phone. We look at some 
of our peers that are out there in the field,  

475
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:06,160
are they really that happy?" And I said, "You 
have a very good point. What is happiness to you?  

476
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,600
Does it need to be at the startup shooting 
for the stock options and drilling yourself  

477
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,120
into the force 12 to 16 hours a day? Or is it 
really saying, hey, I want to work for a very  

478
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,880
laid back organization in which I have my life 
and I could go to concerts and mountain bike  

479
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,720
on the weekends and take a vacation every 
now and then and have a lower salary?"What  

480
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,279
is your passion and what is going to 
create the it's fine moment for you? 

481
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,360
This is a very hard discussion and I think a 
lot of us in our field are torn by this, "Go  

482
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:45,840
to the startup. Get your options and your bonuses 
and all this other stuff, because all my friends  

483
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,160
are doing it." And then you get over there and 
you're dying. And I see this happen all the time.  

484
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,840
And on the other side, you see individuals in your 
friends out there mountain biking on the weekend,  

485
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:01,360
it's like, what are you doing differently? 
It's like, I don't need that. I want my life.  

486
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,360
I like having a different way of doing it. You're 
still technical, but you're choosing a different  

487
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:14,560
path, and this is where you have to make that 
option there because the deduction of the other  

488
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,360
side makes it sound like it's really cool, but are 
you really going to be landing on that big payout?  

489
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,359
And that's where, when we get into some of 
these last assuage of this, we'll get that. 

490
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,240
The next thing we had talked about 
here is the up, down, left, and right,  

491
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:38,320
is when you're in any organization, managing 
relationships requires you to manage up, down,  

492
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,280
left, and right in almost every single situation.  

493
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:49,120
And what that means is that a lot of us, we 
latch on to only those individuals that we like.  

494
00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:00,640
It's weird. We tend to only interact with 
people that we like. In all organizations,  

495
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:06,640
and this is where the hard part is, you have to 
break out of your comfort zone and interact and  

496
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,040
manage relationships and build relationships 
with people that you sometimes don't like.  

497
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,160
And that sometimes means I need to go out of my 
way to manage a good relationship with my boss.  

498
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,760
I need to manage relationships with those that 
work underneath me, that maybe I don't like,  

499
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:30,560
peers I don't like. You have to really spend 
time, especially as technical individuals,  

500
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,200
we're not sometimes the most 
social individuals on the planet  

501
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,280
and it's hard for us.
And I know I just totally  

502
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,960
went down the trope of what technical people 
are, we're not social, but we're all here,  

503
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:48,240
but at the same time it's hard in many cases 
across the board, whether we're social or not,  

504
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:56,080
all human beings tend to flock to people that 
resemble us in general, and sometimes we have  

505
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:05,520
to break through and say, "I'm going to reach 
out to someone across in my peer and just get  

506
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,840
to know them and spend some time building a 
relationship with someone we don't know. It  

507
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:19,440
will pay off in spades in your relationships at 
work. It pays, every single time I've done this,  

508
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,120
and I say, "I'm going to go and spend time 
with someone I don't know," it builds bridges.  

509
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,200
And every single time I've done this in my 
career, it has always, always, always paid off. 

510
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,759
Sometimes it takes time, especially 
[inaudible 00:52:33] like, okay, he and I  

511
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:41,520
or she and I or they and I ended up having 
some sort of a heated email exchange, something  

512
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,800
happened there. So I will intentionally go out of 
my way to, "Let's go to lunch," or I'll call them  

513
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,640
on the phone and spend some time with them on the 
phone and say, "We're not talking work, let's just  

514
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,279
find out who you are." Do some backstory 
discussions. Talk about families, vacations,  

515
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,640
something else. Build the relationships in 
your organizations as potentially necessary. 

516
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:11,759
And also tied to the thing I was talking about 
passion versus it's fine, is that your money,  

517
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,200
everyone who knows the TikTok meme here,  

518
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,680
this is a very short one to close this out is that 
if you have your passion, the money will follow.  

519
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,720
Don't chase money. If you do, it will 
create that it's fine environment for you.  

520
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,280
The money, as every single time that I've talked 
to people out there, is that if you find your  

521
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,880
passion, you will be paid, you're going to be in 
a situation that's like, "I don't know. I'm paid  

522
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,160
silly money for the job that I love." If you find 
your passion, they're going to pay you for it. 

523
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,839
It's just like, you're going to be waking 
up, especially in your technical degrees,  

524
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,440
especially in your technical field, everyone 
in here is technical, you're on the right path,  

525
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,000
you're going to be paid for your job if 
you're going to stick with the cyber security,  

526
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,280
cyber forensic side that you're doing in here. 
Not all money is created equal. Just realize that,  

527
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,240
but find your passion, if you find what you love, 
you'll be paid for it. But don't always say,  

528
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,439
"I am taking the job that pays the most money." 
Just be really careful about that in general. 

529
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,720
All right. In summary, I'm going to redefine 
these as we're going through it. Number one,  

530
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,640
don't be afraid to wear the dance shoes. Number 
two, what are the rules? What is the obstacle?  

531
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,520
And again, don't be afraid to break the 
rules. Look at the obstacles and look  

532
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,840
for the ways around them. Number three, and 
we need a T-shirt for this, find your Chad.  

533
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,200
We could get a T-shirt made by the end of 
the summit, that'd be amazing. We need Chad's  

534
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:05,759
face on it, by the way, just his face, just 
straight up, "Find your Chad." Number four,  

535
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,880
don't settle for its fine. Overall if you're 
in that situation, you're probably in a,  

536
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,120
you're in a pickle. I've found again and 
again, if someone's in a it's fine situation,  

537
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,759
you need to potentially look for a reboot. 
Find your passion, it's tied directly to that. 

538
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,120
Number six, build relationships with those you 
normally don't build relationships with. If it's  

539
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,319
a relationship feels like, "Wow, that was easy," 
that's not the relationships I'm talking about.  

540
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,000
It's the relationships with the folks that it's 
like, I actually need to think, I need to build  

541
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,440
a relationship with that person. That's the 
folks that I'm talking about. And number seven,  

542
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,600
it's not about the money. The money's going to 
follow you whenever you are following your own  

543
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,319
passion. That ties directly into, for anyone 
who's out there starting in your career,  

544
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,320
all of these rules are going to be maintained. 
This is what I wish they taught you in SANS  

545
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:08,800
classes. This is what I routinely tell people 
throughout the 20 years I've been teaching SANS,  

546
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,560
these are the same rules again and 
again and again that I've advised people  

547
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,080
when you're working through your careers.
Now, at the end of this, one general rule  

548
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:27,920
that I started with, always learn. As a part 
of that, we have a brand new released guide,  

549
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,200
the new DFIR manual written by Phil 
Moore, Heather Mahalik, Kat Hedley,  

550
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:43,839
Jason Jordan that has just been released at this 
event, big round of applause for them right now.  

551
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:50,000
And they have done an amazing job 
and this is just recently released. 

552
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:55,600
Now to close this off, what I'd like 
everyone to do to close off this  

553
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,200
segment is I want everyone to stand. I know 
this is going to sound stupid, but stand up,  

554
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,000
stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up. We're 
going to take a breather here. What I want you to  

555
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:10,880
do is to build a relationship right now, and are 
we going on break after this? Okay, we're going  

556
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:17,520
to go on break after this. What I'd like you to 
do is I need you to build a relationship with two  

557
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,160
people that you don't know next to you, you have 
to shake their hand, introduce yourselves to them,  

558
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,600
and say where you're from and then go 
out in the hallway and eat and drink  

559
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:39,839
with them. All right. Thanks everyone. My 
name's Rob Lee. I appreciate your time.
