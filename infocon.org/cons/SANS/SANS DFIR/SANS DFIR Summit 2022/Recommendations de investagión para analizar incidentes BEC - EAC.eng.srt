00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,980
My name is Eduardo Chavarro Valle, I am a

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,740
specialist in responding to incidents

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,120
failing responsibly throughout

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
Latin America and the objective of this

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,940
talk is to give some recommendations

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,320
regarding the activities that we

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,900
have been able to carry out to investigate

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,199
Beck-type incidents of business

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,240
compromise of business accounts that

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,710
Now it has mutated and it is described as

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,980
[Music],

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,899
which is basically the compromise

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,260
of email accounts in general, on

14
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,059
which some

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,160
activities that are exploited by

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,980


17
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,700


18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,239
adversaries are identified.

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,559
been able to develop

20
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,460
from that experience that we

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,039
have been able to have on

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,239
the development of this type of

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,400
investigation where we have or where we

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,979
find opportunities what other

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,439
questions can we answer in

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,500
forensic terms the objective is to answer

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,479
a series of concerns and here are

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,060
others that also give  great value  to the

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,400
investigation And it is in our interest to

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,439
share how we are doing it And

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,500
where we have found some

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,640
quite relevant elements

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,119
the agenda for today to

34
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,740
talk about making a very

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,320
general introduction of this type of incidents

36
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,400
of the bec and the leac What is it  refers to how it

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,820
has mutated where they find opportunities

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,079
What are the targets of this type of

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
adversaries and then propose a

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,420
series of strategies based on the

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,320
same challenges that we have identified

42
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,520
regarding research

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,460
we always seek to collect evidence but the

44
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,740
evidence is not always

45
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,020
o Generally in these in  This type of

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,500
incident is not, let's

47
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,899
say it is not standard, it has

48
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,540
limitations, so how can we play

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,680
with all these limitations, with this

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,819
absence of standards, with this

51
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,120
homogeneity of components and

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
artifacts, so that we can integrate them

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,280
and develop mainly time lines,

54
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,480


55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,940
let's talk a bit  how to prepare

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,040
the information how opportune  we have

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
with the same libraries and

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,319
proposals that

59
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,879
we already know but How can we integrate them

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,019
to do something much more elaborate

61
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,360
quickly on that information

62
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,760
we collect How can we do a

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,800
search

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,260
Sorry How can we do a search

65
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,500
regarding impersonation activities

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,720
or commonly used technical elements

67
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,800
without  However, in this case and the

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,300
oxidizers that we have had the

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,580
opportunity to work on, we do not find

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,800
many technical elements that abuse

71
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
the weaknesses or lack of

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,000
controls in the in, especially in

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
email if we do not go to

74
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,500
our next topic on the agenda and it

75
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,480
is  the domains of appearance, which is

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,540
where these adversaries have found multiple

77
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,940
possibilities and that is

78
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,920
where we want to also focus a bit on

79
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
the

80
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,300
alert talk in the headers once we

81
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,280
have the opportunity to share that

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,500
information. How can we move to

83
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,060
look for alerts that can be a  alert

84
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,360
for us whether they are ale  Some technical routes or

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,459
those that we are going to describe about the

86
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,280
analysis of time lines that what

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,260
metadata what metadata are important

88
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,540
what timestamps are important and

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
we can integrate in time to try

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,440
to make new hypotheses

91
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,440
and we are going to close in general terms by

92
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,379
talking a little  of those key elements

93
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,980
within the body of the message and even

94
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,080
that we can also find in the

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,700
attached elements that help

96
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,400
us give us value in the event of

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
integrating more elements into the

98
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,319
investigation, it's

99
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,478
ok Perfect, so

100
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,060
what is the bec if the business the

101
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,520
commitment of  business accounts or

102
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,040
email accounts basically it is a

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,979
fraud directed at companies that make

104
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,419
transfers by electronic means

105
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,380
either with local suppliers or

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,500
suppliers abroad

107
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,180
really at first we see a

108
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,780
very high opportunity from adversaries

109
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,860
focused on companies that had a

110
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,259
relationship of acquisition of goods

111
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,360
materials with suppliers

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,580
abroad main  mainly in some

113
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,800
cases due to the language situation

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,440
So the provider was in a country

115
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,800
where English was natively spoken the

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,560
client was in Latin America speaking

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,500
especially Spanish so there was a

118
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
situation there of language change

119
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,460
that suddenly created a barrier And the

120
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,720
adversaries found themselves  the

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,220
opportunity but today it is

122
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,860
there are no limits in

123
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,900
language barriers and there are no barriers regarding

124
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,960
whether it is international or local there are

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,139
local actors there are regional actors And

126
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,699
of course there are some very well-

127
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,860
founded and well-prepared actors at a global level

128
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,039


129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,380
supplanting  the participants

130
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,120
in both the transfers and the

131
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,940
acquisition of goods really at the

132
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,580
beginning the main objective of this

133
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,000
type of adversary will be to

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,580
integrate into the conversation

135
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,860
learn what the two

136
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,780
parties were discussing how an acquisition of

137
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,520
goods was made how the transfer of

138
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,860
funds was made  of payment accounts receivable

139
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,900
etc.

140
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,940
and they are interested  They came and what they were looking for

141
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,180
was to change the destination to which

142
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,740
those funds that were going to be transferred arrived. But

143
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,120
lately they have also found a

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,280
great opportunity in the assets and

145
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,320
then not only in the payment for

146
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,940
acquiring those assets but also in the

147
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,039
assets to make those  goods arrive

148
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,340
at a destination that is being controlled

149
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,340
by them warehouses maybe

150
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
intermediary countries where they are going to

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,780
take control they collect them they do not hoard

152
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,039
and of course they monetize it

153
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,860
later

154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,720
What are the main objectives

155
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,819
we are really talking about

156
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,000
organizations but also about people

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,340
yes where  They find these types of

158
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,039
opportunities, they are going to make the

159
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,740
most of it, so it is not something

160
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,960
exclusively for companies. Of course,

161
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,020
an impact on a company means

162
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,759


163
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
fraud in much higher monetary terms,

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,740


165
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,720
but they have also found a lot

166
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,819
of opportunities to

167
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,919
specifically target people because

168
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,160
finally  we maybe think about

169
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,259
a trip vacation with the family

170
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,199
we end up making an acquisition

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,900
of goods through electronic means

172
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,680
that if we handle them through an

173
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,900
email conversation or

174
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,280
even through other social networks

175
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,860
to make

176
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,840
the selection evaluation the acquisition

177
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,639
of new items you do not have tickets and

178
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,800
a series of  additional components

179
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,120
Well, the adversaries find there

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,759
opportunities to take more

181
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,419
important money

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,539
there is a very important detail here and it

183
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,300
is that this type of attack is very

184
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,759
focused on social engineering that

185
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,620
is supported these are

186
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,020
traditional attacks we are talking about

187
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,759
fishing we are talking about  social engineering

188
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,280


189
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,360
techniques that are not unknown

190
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,960
, however, they are supported by a

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
really strong structure, we are

192
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,139
talking about that they require a

193
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,780
bank account to which

194
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,660
the resources that are

195
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,139
being subjected to this type of technique are going to be transferred, and

196
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,599
these bank accounts require some

197
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,760
with  Special conditions cannot come to

198
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,080
open a bank account today

199
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,839
and simply expect to receive 300

200
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,700
thousand dollars there because in general terms

201
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,559
that is not allowed I am immediately

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,740
going to alert the

203
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,740
transactional controls so they have a

204
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,899
very strong structure in

205
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,300
which they already  They have this type of account They

206
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,120
have already been compromised They have it

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,980
Under their power They have a track record They have

208
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,140
a reputation They take advantage of other accounts

209
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,740
that they violate They create

210
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,899
intermediate structures depending, let's say, on the

211
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,060
lapses Are the countries Are the

212
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,140
institutions in different regions

213
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,959
to allow this type of account  of activities

214
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,339
they do not know how to handle, they do it very well and they

215
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,620
have been doing this

216
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,839
type of activity for a long time, we realize that it

217
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,360
is something that can really happen to

218
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,820
anyone

219
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,959
when they have had the opportunity to

220
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,019
work on these incidents and I explain more

221
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,500
or less How the timeline is going

222
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,660
It's impressive, let's say no, you

223
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,459
can't believe it  they can't really see it

224
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,180
and something that is fundamental here is that

225
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,700
generally there is an absence of malware it

226
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,200
's more of an activity to affect the

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,839
human condition for people

228
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,600
then

229
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,120
when you uncover that situation

230
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,740
where malware is generally not

231
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,160
involved in let's say  that companies

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
like to say Ok Here is a situation

233
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,899
in which we have to start working

234
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:09,420
to raise awareness on all

235
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,700
these issues because really a

236
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,180
misread word misinterpreted an unverified message

237
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
can become a

238
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,500
fraud and a significant loss  of

239
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,740
resources

240
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,820
another important element here is the

241
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,300
collection of evidence here that giving

242
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,160
value to information without value It is

243
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,660
really relevant in

244
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,420
digital terms above research and

245
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,680
what are the challenges here so

246
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
we talk about there being multiple formats

247
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,779
right we have containers of

248
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,640
information we have

249
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,579
individual messages  we have calendar notes

250
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,600
we have multiple sources now  a we have

251
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,760
services in Awards we

252
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,459
have cloud services we have third-party services,

253
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,700
for example financial contacts, the

254
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,680
financial entity may handle

255
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,600
communication by email through

256
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,060
other additional components, so

257
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,399
there are multiple sources. Yes, we are already

258
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,800
talking about a situation of

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,440
heterogeneous content that we must  integrate and

260
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,279
start looking for value,

261
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,980
we are talking about retention, which is extremely

262
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,279
valuable and has become

263
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,660
extremely relevant in recent years

264
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,540
in terms of research because the

265
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,579
incident could occur today, but we are going to

266
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,019
do a validation and we find that

267
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,300
perhaps that first access is that

268
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,279
primary instruction that there was It was generated

269
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,980
six months ago and we are going to need to see

270
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,140
those six months of history that has

271
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,860
happened the most where

272
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,200
the arms of these adversaries have suddenly reached

273
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,720
to have more information with

274
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,040
retention again is an

275
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
important element and in  the cloud of course is

276
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
something we must keep in mind  Given that

277
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,360
it will always be necessary to know when

278
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,220
we have a service, especially

279
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,500
email, what type and what

280
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
retention guarantees we have

281
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
there and above all, how can we go to

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,440
consult it, that it is a purchased service,

283
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,920
an additional plugin that

284
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,980
we must consider that it already comes integral

285
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,660
that  I will simply be able to

286
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,480
constantly monitor

287
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,940
each of the

288
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,380
email formats, we once again have

289
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,740
the data format in headers that

290
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,839
perhaps and generally give us a lot of

291
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,820
information, the content, the body, the

292
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
messages, the parameterization, which is an

293
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,260
element that these adversaries

294
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,540
They take advantage a lot so in

295
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,940
parameterization they come and tell each

296
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,880
email that comes from

297
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,639
adversary@ or from the company at

298
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,339
domain.com that it leads to spam because

299
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,019
in spam we will not be checking but

300
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,220
the adversary knows that it will get

301
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,320
there and on top of that it will continue  keeping the

302
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,360
communication of course impersonating the

303
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
company

304
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,980
metadata attachment  the attachments

305
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,959
have also given us very valuable information

306
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,660
regarding when the adversary managed to

307
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,200
arrive or what type of information he

308
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,139
has taken for himself and to establish his

309
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,399
strategy

310
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,200
and finally all this must be

311
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,860
collected in a forensic way carry

312
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,839
the guarantees of chain custody avoid

313
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:25,980
the  manipulation of information

314
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,440
etc. then we cannot leave

315
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,000
out any of these components

316
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,420
What are the main challenges

317
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,940
that we have faced with which

318
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,940
we have faced So as

319
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,980
presumir and chapping rice write in

320
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,980
the book

321
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,779
we can see

322
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,220
the proposal that they give  Regarding the

323
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,220
pips library, which is a library that

324
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,100
basically receives a container and does

325
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,160
a sweep. Yes, it runs through each of

326
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
the components of that container.

327
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,579
Let's think that our

328
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,040
email has an inbox,

329
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,760
outbox, deleted to spam, but

330
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,820
there are situations.  in which the

331
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,760
inbox has a 10.50 100 folders

332
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,339
think In u  A company that has

333
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,320
suppliers that has

334
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,279


335
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,260
any other person from whom they

336
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,000
receive emails, perhaps the event,

337
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,579
legal,

338
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:37,740
government, etc., so what

339
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,019
is the objective here of taking advantage of

340
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,620
what pee proposes to do?

341
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,360


342
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,600
on a container, go

343
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,279
scanning and extracting each of the

344
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,339
messages, which is what we are interested in,

345
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,360
regardless of the folders where they

346
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,459
are, we are going to extract that information and

347
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:59,579
of course to maceate it for a walk to

348
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,500
try to convert them into

349
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,380
data states and there

350
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,199
we can have

351
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:08,940
different pst different containers

352
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,040
as we can also have

353
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,220
individual emails

354
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,440
So what we want to propose is

355
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,839
through python of course using

356
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,360
the Panda libraries to generate those

357
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,100
lists in which I convert all

358
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,860
that mass of information into texts and those

359
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,680
texts I can already  match

360
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,760
manipulate query quickly

361
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,260
sort cro  logically,

362
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,279
through these, that image, true of

363
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,300
all the situations that can be

364
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,560
carried out, to begin to shed

365
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,420
light on what happened What

366
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,220
was the key moment that we should investigate the most, we are

367
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,540


368
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,779
talking about multiple PS3s because, as

369
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,940
we have, we have had the opportunity to

370
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,880
investigate it, we talk about the information

371
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,040
prohibited by each of the parties and

372
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,399
generally each one provides what they are

373
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,920
willing to provide and we also talk

374
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,959
about issues of privacy confidentiality

375
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,079
in which

376
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:15,180
a series of emails are generally integrated that

377
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,680
perhaps are not the only authorized  Others

378
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,540
remain there because they have

379
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,720
some legal elements that cannot

380
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,060
be integrated into the

381
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,800
investigation immediately,

382
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
knowing that we already have, let's say, a

383
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,459
structure in which we can extract

384
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,220
all the messages from the container or we can

385
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,120
take each one of the messages, sorry,

386
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
we begin to prepare  those that

387
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,259
information to take that Data and start

388
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:46,740
giving it  a structure Here we make use of

389
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,220
the stagmonths function

390
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,440
again it is a

391
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,560
is a ready-made function No we are not going to

392
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,440
invent the wheel but the objective is

393
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,040
once we do the cycle of

394
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,559
collecting each of the messages or

395
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
integrating them with other messages that

396
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,179
arrive  individual that happens a lot

397
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,619
we begin to take from this information

398
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,299
data that is relevant to us

399
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,699
what data the from The cc

400
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,959
the dates subject data from the

401
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,299
messenbody the headers in short there are

402
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,699
multiple

403
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:28,620
data that are relevant that can be

404
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,540
relevant and that if I quickly

405
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,040
convert them into  text lists I can

406
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,799
start working with them

407
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
once we extract all this

408
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,340
information and that they are already divided

409
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,559
we can start generating

410
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,340
specific strategies here our invitation is

411
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,360
to use Jupiter notebooks with the

412
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,580
main objective

413
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,740
let's say that here we propose a

414
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,900
true structure what I am  doing

415
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,640
is proposing a work structure

416
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,760
but that I can document and that is the

417
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,500
Jupiter's success that allows me to

418
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,840
document Because I create each function that

419
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,640
I am extracting as I should use it,

420
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160


421
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,380
so that in the event that an incident occurs,

422
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,000
the same conditions,

423
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,799
let's say, this work is already done and it is

424
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,240
only starting to see if

425
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,140
something needs to be integrated  In fact, this addition

426
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,580
is the product of several incidents in

427
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,260
which we have integrated new

428
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,720
components into the same Notebook

429
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
to begin to understand how they work,

430
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
but each one of them

431
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,440
is giving us a lot

432
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,820
of attack techniques. So

433
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,900
let's finally talk later But

434
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,640
first  Let's all talk about

435
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,340
domains of appearance, that acquisition

436
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,100
of structure that is proposed in

437
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,799
technique 1583 de maitre in which

438
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,960
basically the adversaries decide to

439
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,299
acquire services, servers, domains

440
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,480
, mail services, etc., because they are

441
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,240
the ones they are going to use to develop

442
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,100
the attack in this case.

443
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,660
we define a very simple function

444
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,240
actually based on circumce mat  cher that

445
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,700
the idea is to try to see from

446
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,280
some known domains yes So the

447
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,660
analyst will have to put there the

448
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,820
valid domains of the companies either

449
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,340
provider client and see on them

450
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,679
where something appears that quickly

451
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,419
tells us that there was a small change that

452
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,240
can  be something in a technique

453
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,039
exploited by adversaries

454
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,860
So we define maybe a trace some

455
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,179
limits 70% that is 70% similar

456
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,419
And we start to review Here we do a

457
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:46,799
search really a very

458
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,240
simple function to search domains of

459
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,799
appearance and this afternoon Search

460
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:52,440
transpiration  or the truncation of two

461
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,059
letters, for example, the change of a

462
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,820
letter, but we could go and integrate something

463
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,419
more elaborate like what Perdón proposes

464
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:01,220


465
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,400
with respect to other

466
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,620
other characters using different

467
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,900
types of coding that also give

468
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,000
opportunity to adversaries and

469
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,320
regarding this there really is a lot

470
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,900
literature that proposes how one can

471
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,299
quickly turn into different

472
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,000
characters and begin  r to generate

473
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,640
multiple options for each letter that are also

474
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,380
used by adversaries

475
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,460
So let's say here we propose and and

476
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,919
what we have I am

477
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,760
currently publishing regarding this Notebook

478
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,539
we have a simple opportunity there to

479
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,880
find transliteration I really

480
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,860
do it because in most cases

481
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,020
it has  attended, the change is very small,

482
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,080
yes it is the change of two letters within

483
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,240
the sentence or of the domain name Or

484
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,980
perhaps the change of one of them by a

485
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,419
number then it really is very

486
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,700
easy to find it like this but I can

487
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,720
do something much more elaborate with others

488
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,820
options that already exist or that

489
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,039
have already been published

490
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,200
and since we are talking about all

491
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,059
this information is already a

492
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,240
true text that I have organized

493
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,799
from the panda awards era

494
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:18,419
,

495
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,160
then I can also do

496
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,679
specific searches in this  case I proposed to

497
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,440
select here

498
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,620
Sorry sorry

499
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,280
I put I don't know three three strings that are

500
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,340
generally going to say that it has  and one that

501
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,200
there is a control that failed or that there is an

502
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,720
absence of controls and I quickly go

503
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,780
looking for what are those messages within

504
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,179
all that Universe of information that I have

505
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,340
obtained that match with This

506
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,159
technique and I have them marked apart so that

507
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,480
I can investigate them later

508
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,179
then we can  to do I don't know those

509
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:05,220
in which the dimar control has failed

510
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,919
the spf and the authentication etc.

511
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,380
So

512
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,380
let's say that I can populate this list

513
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,620
with multiple additional options to

514
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,659
try to see suddenly other techniques

515
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,140
used as I said no no I have not

516
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,440
had to face  This type of

517
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,860
technique Because right now

518
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,020
the theme of appearance domains is widely used,

519
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,480
but we cannot rule it out in

520
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,919
any way, it will always be good

521
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,340
within those of these

522
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,299
universal messages to see which of them

523
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,120
have some element that we should finally keep in

524
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,658
mind.

525
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,720
based on the information

526
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,380
I have in my information lists

527
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,380
certain text to do searches very

528
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,720
Quickly,

529
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,340
we propose the analysis of time lines,

530
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,820
what can we look for there? Well,

531
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,460
the metadata of

532
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,400
mail received sent, of

533
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,179
course, use a standard utc format,

534
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,640
but we can also begin to

535
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,120
validate the domains of the emails that

536
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,419
are received sent from the

537
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,059
mailboxes.  from to cc from the headers

538
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,740
of the messages extract all these

539
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,539
domains and start validating on these

540
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,000
domains make a search a judge and

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,620
on that trial mainly

542
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,100
determine when they were created and

543
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,960
when I have these new timestamps it

544
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,120
will start to include them within

545
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,080
my line  research my line the

546
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,020
timeline to see if there are some milestones

547
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,120
there that could give me value and on

548
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,059
which I should focus my research

549
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,460
What is the objective of the

550
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,799
timeline analysis is let's say one of the

551
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,419
most important resources we have in

552
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,340
the analysis  digital by the seal is

553
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,720
basically carrying out a sequence of

554
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,880
activities in which there elements

555
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,980
that I know But it may be that some

556
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,080
of which the same walk of information

557
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,240
I manage to integrate within the

558
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,100
time line will give me a certain light some

559
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,260
vestiges of where I should go to pay

560
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,780
attention to investigate and develop a

561
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,500
deeper analysis Yes then

562
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,400
based on the IP addresses to some

563
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,260
of the domains the names of the

564
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,020
domains in short as with each one of

565
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,260
them can you give me more information

566
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,559
this is our our our Notebook

567
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,020
you can find it at the end we have the

568
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,240
link so you can see it let's say

569
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,840
some descriptions

570
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,500
but here basically what we are

571
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,120
doing It's OK our first stage

572
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,860
preparing the data of course loading

573
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,260
the libraries we need and the

574
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,280
steps we are going to start

575
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,740
preparing data Search for

576
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,840
appearance domains in this first instance

577
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,500
Although it goes quickly there we are going to

578
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,960
wait  here a couple of here something

579
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,200
important It's already for this demo what

580
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,059
I

581
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,299
loaded was some messages that I don't know

582
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,960
m  sg

583
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,460
and here I am saying that the

584
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,159
legitimate domain is Gmail and to the mail not mail but

585
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,039
Mail for what reason because I have emails that are

586
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,520
from legitimate Gmail So what

587
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,020
he is going to do is say look there is a

588
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,820
domain that looks a lot like the one you are

589
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,919
looking for yes it is basically with that

590
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,720
objective as to present some

591
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,240
results and see how it extracts that

592
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,820
data quickly

593
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,880
ready to run there

594
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,220
then it is quickly telling me Yes

595
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,100
look we have that we have analyzed And

596
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,539
apparently there is an appearance

597
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,299
domain because an appearance domain because

598
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:08,220
it  It looks a lot like what I define as

599
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,720
the legitimate domain. So it

600
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,580
quickly dawns on me what he is

601
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,740
going to do next. It is about that domain of

602
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,179
appearance to obtain information. We are going to

603
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,480
continue

604
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,700
because we search on that domain

605
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,720
that appears to us there

606
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,840
quickly. We collect information,

607
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,940
metadata, we give ourselves.  Note that

608
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,220
the creation date does exist and that

609
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,360
information of course again

610
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,100
enters the list  a and we are going to have it

611
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,139
within our timeline it is

612
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,360
worth the following is to extract those

613
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,480
suspicious mailboxes to try to

614
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,820
understand a little more who to try to

615
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,100
impersonate why it could be that

616
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
they simply reached them here it is

617
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,020
very relevant to understand everyone who

618
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,460
is involved  those who are

619
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,679
informed and all those who are elements

620
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,440
of action within that

621
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,820
of all those people who are

622
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,799
contacted by the adversaries or who

623
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,440
have been established by the

624
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,500
adversaries within the communication

625
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,880
Generally what the organizations say

626
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,440
is please investigate

627
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,419
the accountant  those who make the

628
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,220
decision that they are key and who say

629
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,659
please make the transfer make the

630
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,880
payment for these resources, however we

631
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,460
have realized Thanks to let's say

632
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,140
this development of activity that we can

633
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,840
find other users who in some

634
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,760
way were never supplanted by the

635
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,500
adversaries  but that clearly can

636
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,299
be

637
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:50,279
an entrance conduit to the

638
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:53,179
communication  tion

639
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,980
What kind of information Sorry we get

640
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,600
here is a timeline is

641
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,880
really about to be the example because

642
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,880
we clearly have events from 95 2021

643
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,799
but here basically what I want to

644
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,500
show is that we can include there all

645
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
the information that we removed and he is

646
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,159
going to illustrate it to me  He is

647
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:13,260
going to order it for me with a time line and he is going to give me some

648
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,840
details. In this second line we see that

649
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,120
here

650
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,960
is an element based on

651
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,820
a marking, some headers, some

652
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,520
risk,

653
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,840
other risk components around here,

654
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,760
but it generates them for me in lines of

655
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,020
time

656
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,360
in a much more elaborate development

657
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,240
I can have something like this This is

658
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,400
a real helmet of course

659
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,860
the names and domains have been changed

660
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,380
but basically in this analysis we

661
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,320
realize that there were two domains that

662
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,240
were these are the legitimate domains

663
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,260
and therefore  here below it will tell us It had

664
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,200
a configuration of its domains

665
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,080
later and that in the time line

666
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,799
it tells me that on

667
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:07,799
June 26 the first was created  January and

668
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,440
the second was created on June 29, I already have two

669
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,380
key moments and it would be very important to

670
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,559
understand why

671
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,640
these situations appear at

672
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,039


673
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,320


674
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,940


675
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,240
that moment.  those that are

676
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,520
more those that were used by those

677
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,140
appearance domains by the emails

678
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,080
created who were

679
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,279
involved who actually impersonated

680
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,460


681
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,820
Here it is then in the time line

682
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,980
it tells me on 26 the first was created on 29

683
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,380
the second was created at 3 o'clock  in the morning

684
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,080
and on the 29th at 4 in the afternoon we already begin

685
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,659
to have elements of use of those emails

686
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,760
going forward.

687
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,220
So let's say that you begin to find

688
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,020
those milestones that can give me more

689
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,440
information,

690
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,100
the next thing

691
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,860
is to do an analysis of the

692
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,419
issues then again  create,

693
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,820
let's say, independent lists

694
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,159
in which about those domains of

695
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,940
appearance What are the most

696
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,740
used subjects who use them  writes based

697
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,200
on what To where but we're going to

698
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
take them to a separate resource to

699
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,860
try to extract as much information

700
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,260
about them

701
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,360
and finally as much as we can get

702
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,240
So let's say right now inside

703
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,059
that Notebook I have a couple of scripts that

704
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:40,500
what they do is a  validation against

705
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,120
intelligence sources to validate

706
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,279
those IP addresses that

707
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,620
appear again within my metadata if there is

708
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,779
any that I should integrate on

709
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,240
which I should pay more attention etc.

710
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,460
because it is already marked in a

711
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,059
reputation database

712
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,520
This is the result, let's say of this

713
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,760
exercise quickly gives me a matter and

714
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,799
tells me this matter is important that I know

715
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,620
who is analyzed for whom and the

716
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,779
date but a much more

717
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:15,419
elaborate exercise quite covered because it is a

718
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:18,120
real exercise we find ourselves

719
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,059
from this analysis within one of the

720
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,500
cc fields an email account that

721
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,960
had not been taken into account and that

722
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,840
was never supplanted but that according to the

723
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,179
development of the investigation because it was

724
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,799
relevant in the investigation

725
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
we found through validation with

726
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,520
the company that it belonged to a person, an

727
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,980
inmate, this intercele lived in an

728
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,179
email and he, to learn,

729
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:49,860
they put him in a copy of a series of

730
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,840
activities, unfortunately he also did not

731
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,700
carry out some behaviors, let's say

732
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,460
of Cyber ​​Hygiene and unfortunately

733
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,520
it was there that they were able to gain access

734
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,159
to it and from there understand how all

735
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,539
the acquisition communication was to

736
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,320
generate the domains of appearance the

737
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,360
infrastructure and start to

738
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,240
really hit the fraud already then It

739
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,179
had not even been taken into account  account

740
00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:16,860
, research efforts were always focused

741
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,480
on other types of users

742
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,059
who were the key elements, but

743
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,500
attention was never paid to the fact that someone who

744
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,899
was, let's say, being notified of

745
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,120
all the elements of the transaction,

746
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,440
acquisition, approval, etc.,

747
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,159
was the one who always gave this opportunity to

748
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,299
enter  this is going to be important

749
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,940
analysis Because it allowed us to find that

750
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,760
resource with that mailbox that

751
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,320
we should start investigating and there

752
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,419
we realized that it was the

753
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:52,220
entry point to this organization

754
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,840
and to close some key elements

755
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,580
the attachments give us a lot of

756
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,380
information they are not together they always go

757
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,820
to have the logo of the company and whether it is a

758
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,679
provider or a client some details

759
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,860
but Generally here this refers to

760
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,940
electronic transfers So

761
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,700
we are going to have a name of a bank and an

762
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,640
account name something important always

763
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,340
in the description there will be something

764
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,460
called  to the reference payment action but

765
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,679
remember that the description is not something

766
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,480
that can have anything and that it

767
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,200
doesn't matter, it's more like a record but it doesn't

768
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,019
define the transaction. So that's

769
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:35,760
where the adversaries take advantage and

770
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,799
put this type of

771
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:41,580
data in the description when they  valid in the last case.

772
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,740
We had an interesting question and

773
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,360
that is that the initials of the company that was

774
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
defining  raudada were very similar to

775
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,340
the acronym of the company from which the

776
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,720
attackers had quick access to their

777
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,740
bank account,

778
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,179
let's say, visually they did

779
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,240
not pay attention to it and

780
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,880
approved the transfer to this

781
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,840
resource the boldface

782
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,780
highlighted elements are also very

783
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,320
important the logos

784
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,239
We had  an opportunity to find the

785
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,480
moment in which they

786
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,679
took control of an email account

787
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,418
Thanks to the logo because in those days

788
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,359
an original transfer had been made

789
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,580
they were

790
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,020
downloading that file and they used the

791
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,879
logo they practically cut it and

792
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:33,960
pasted it into a new document

793
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,260
Exactly the same  What was the

794
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,899
fraudulent document So all those

795
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,659
elements Of course Prevention elements are always going to give us a

796
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,560
lot of value

797
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:49,699


798
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,159
Any urgent call means that

799
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,679
I must pay attention, if not not attend to it

800
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,540
immediately, but understand who

801
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,520
requires it for what they require it for and under what

802
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,339
conditions they require it  is asking yes

803
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:03,839
Usually in this tip  o of situations

804
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,480
there is a lot of pressure from the

805
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,580
attackers

806
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,839
we recently had an incident that

807
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,960
we attended in which the unauthorized transfer

808
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,420
was made to an account that

809
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,859
account was blocked by the

810
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,339
receiving bank because the flow was much greater

811
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:27,060
than what was normally handled and

812
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,800
the  What the adversary did was

813
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
call the company and say, "Hey, they

814
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,940
blocked my account, please ask them to

815
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,460
return it to you and send it to this other company,

816
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,480
and unfortunately they did, they

817
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,160
followed, let's say, the

818
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,980
attacker's recommendations to request the money and

819
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,480
send it back to another  account and that

820
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,160
account could already handle higher flows

821
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,780
of money and the money was able to know

822
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,000
without any problem the good news is

823
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,980
that thanks also to the interaction of

824
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,780
financial institutions at the international level it

825
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,660
was possible to block the

826
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,640
withdrawal of funds and the

827
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,560
money but realizing that the

828
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,300
money left came out and was only

829
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
authorizations you

830
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,079
can find this

831
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,280
this proposal  because I called it

832
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,960
investigation in my github along with

833
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,280
another series of streets that you can

834
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,540
find there for python Jupiter and

835
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,240
here the references that I have used

836
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,339
to create this proposal of

837
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:31,680
course and for the analyzes that I have

838
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,420
come to develop on different

839
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,560
occasions That's all  what I had to

840
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,900
share Thank you very much for your

841
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,760
time and I really hope it is of

842
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,859
great value to you Thank you charros
