1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,679
welcome thanks for showing up for my

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,219
talk uh we're gonna Jump Right In really

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,020
really fast

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,800
um

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
I uh I run a pretty old company uh I was

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,580
doing digital forensics before it kind

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,980
of had a name at least in Canada

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,240
and uh we also run a fully equipped

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,120
class 100 clean room so we do data

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,940
recovery at the platter level uh

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,120
swapping out Motors and and head stacks

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,260
and turning head stacks on and off uh I

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,420
teach for Sans I teach a few classes for

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,140
Sans and uh I'm also the co-author of

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,260
forensics 498 Battlefield forensics and

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,239
data acquisition

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,160
also if you want to know more about me

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,300
there's uh a link to my CV

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,000
everything I'm about to talk about in

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,780
this lecture is true as of right now it

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,180
could change in five minutes I think we

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,080
all know how forensics ends up and uh it

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,360
was funny Josh had talked about the

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,159
answer to most forensic questions being

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,680
it depends a very true is that

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,700
um

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,100
now the reason that I'm up here

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,759
well I I blame a few people uh I blame

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,360
robly first of all because I learned a

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,040
lot of what I thought I knew about

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,799
digital forensics from him uh Back in

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,780
the Day or about USP forensics back in

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,780
the day uh Dan dickerman asked the

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,420
question to me once about serial numbers

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,939
on USB devices this was a few years ago

37
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,299
and that started me down uh the the path

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,280
that I've come to and what brought me

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
here today was Chad Tilbury one of the

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,259
authors of forensics 500 when he asked

41
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,700
me to review the new uh uh courseware on

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,180
USB forensics and that turned into a

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,360
multi-day Endeavor

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,800
my wife will tell you that when I get a

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,140
knot in my craw you're not going to see

46
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,780
me for a few days until I come back up

47
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,540
the other side I don't have all the

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,360
answers and in fact you're going to see

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,080
through today that uh this raises more

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,560
questions than it answers there's a lot

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,700
of room

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,900
or research further research

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,520
from who

54
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,819
all of you

55
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,440
if anybody here is sitting wondering you

56
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
know I read Twitter and I read blogs and

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,019
how do people get their information on

58
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,900
there where does it come from it comes

59
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,920
from

60
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,220
getting a bee in your Bonnet and not

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,840
stopping

62
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
folks if you ever want to do a little

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,819
bit of research

64
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,819
reach out to me I will help you get that

65
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,379
started there are so many different

66
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,140
areas within forensics that we need

67
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,920
research research like this I am more

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,019
than happy to help you get started on

69
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,360
the road to that research and get you

70
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,860
published

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,980
because we need this information now

72
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,900
more than ever

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,060
now there's two groups of people in this

74
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,379
room right now

75
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,120
there are people

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,860
who have done or are doing USB forensics

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,080
for real

78
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,799
without the tools Nintendo forensics

79
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,659
right push a button does it give me the

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,599
answer hey it gives me the answer

81
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,079
that must be the right answer

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,260
wrong okay and the other group of people

83
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,480
are people who either have never done

84
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,760
USB forensics maybe you're new to the

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,700
forensics field and or have only done

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,060
USB forensics with push button tools

87
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,940
that is not to say that the tools are

88
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,900
bad

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,720
tools are great tools are efficient but

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,440
is your tool telling you the truth

91
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,000
that's why we're here today okay so

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,720
if you've not done in the weeds USB

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,419
forensics some of this may seem a little

94
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,280
bit new to you

95
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
for those of you that have been doing it

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,820
for a while we're just going to do a bit

97
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
of a review okay so the story up to this

98
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,639
point we know that we go into the system

99
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,919
Hive of the registry

100
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,240
we look inside the USB store sub key

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,720
and we see our devices listed

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,120
and we've got the make and model of the

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,180
device and when we expand that sub key

104
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,759
we are provided with

105
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,940
what we have highlighted there

106
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,199
for those of you that have been doing

107
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,020
this for a while what do we call that

108
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,979
highlighted number

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,500
the serial number

110
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,620
we have been told this is this serial

111
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,460
number of our USB device

112
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,340
so just for the example here that top

113
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,460
one is for anyone who's attended

114
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,340
most any Sans class at least before

115
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,979
covid you know that you got your VMS on

116
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,340
a USB device well that's the top one an

117
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,680
example of that USB device the bot the

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,500
second one is this one that I have in my

119
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,560
hand I carry it everywhere

120
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,000
it's an extreme Pro SanDisk Extreme Pro

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
and again this is what we have always

122
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,880
believed to be the serial number

123
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,120
many of us to this day still believe as

124
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,900
well that these are the devices all of

125
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,060
the devices that have been connected to

126
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,919
our machine via USB

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,740
Ron

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,199
but before we get to finding out how

129
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,419
wrong we were

130
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,460
we need to get a little education from

131
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,500
Microsoft because they are the

132
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,139
all-knowing All-Seeing

133
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,660
everything Windows knowledge Keepers

134
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,860
correct

135
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,160
so let's see what Microsoft says about

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,919
those things that we think are serial

137
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,780
numbers they say

138
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,020
that they call them either device IDs or

139
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,259
variously I serial numbers and these

140
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,660
numbers now I don't like reading off a

141
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,100
slide but I think it's important to do

142
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,400
it here a device defined index of the

143
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
string descriptor that provides a string

144
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,539
that contains a manufacturer determined

145
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:52,979
serial number

146
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,960
for the device

147
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,680
the manufacturer determined serial

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,180
number of device that's that's pretty

149
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,259
darn clear

150
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,100
they are very very clearly saying

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,380
those are the serial numbers

152
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,660
or the device

153
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,819
we're going to find out that is just not

154
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,979
true

155
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,380
well let's find out what Powershell says

156
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,680
when we start asking it

157
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,620
at a Level under the covers we run the

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,380
command that you see on the screen here

159
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,860
and it will show us our model we have

160
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,900
those two devices listed

161
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,880
but now look at the serial number is

162
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,060
that the same as what we just saw

163
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,259
no

164
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,759
now

165
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,259
I hate to call anybody a liar but it

166
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,500
says on the screen serial number I

167
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,720
didn't edit this this is the way

168
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,539
Powershell demonstrates it you're going

169
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,539
to see at the very end of the device ID

170
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,840
now this is where you see the string

171
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,319
that you saw here

172
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,979
not the same as the serial number

173
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,680
here it's calling it a device ID

174
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,940
we're going to come back to that

175
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,699
I said that many of us believe that is

176
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,919
where all of the USB connected devices

177
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,160
are and then I said wrong

178
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,879
you see USB devices are not just USB

179
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,699
devices there's different kinds of USB

180
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,020
devices we have removable storage we

181
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,200
have fixed disk storage

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,020
and the factory gets to decide how that

183
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,940
device is going to identify when you

184
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
plug it in if the device identifies as

185
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,820
fixed disk storage you will never see it

186
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,700
in USB store key so if that's the only

187
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,380
place you've been looking for USB

188
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,640
devices you have been missing out

189
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,640
because if we go back to the system key

190
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,380
and we look down where we were looking

191
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,959
for the USB store Key

192
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,700
well there's another key there called

193
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,920
scuzzy

194
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,100
and if we expand that guess what we see

195
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,180
there that is our list of connected USB

196
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,720
devices that identify as fixed disk

197
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,680
storage our external spinning hard

198
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
drives

199
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,040
or solid state

200
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,019
in a whole different key

201
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,519
now we see something else interesting

202
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,700
here because well at least the two

203
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,160
devices that I have highlighted here

204
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,540
there's a Samsung SSD

205
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,839
there's also a spinning Seagate hard

206
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,920
drive

207
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
both of them are highlighted here and

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,320
they have what we have long been told as

209
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,360
a serial number but for those of you

210
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,920
that have been doing this for a while

211
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,800
you will note that the second character

212
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,279
is an ampersand

213
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,279
what have we been told

214
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,820
about the ampersand

215
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,040
we have been told that if the second

216
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,760
character is an ampersand that means

217
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,240
that the device has not been

218
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,820
digitally signed or is not a genuine

219
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,339
Windows authorized device

220
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,640
and or it has not been given a serial

221
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
number by the makers

222
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,300
and so Windows gave it some kind of an

223
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,720
identifier just to a uniquely identify

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,000
it as different from another device

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,480
right

226
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
that Ampersand has always been telling

227
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,060
us this doesn't have a serial number

228
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,480
so Windows gave it this code

229
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,740
right

230
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,779
for those of us been doing that we know

231
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,060
this to be true I want you to remember

232
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,260
this

233
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,360
it's going to come up again

234
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,260
so I took a spinning hard drive

235
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,200
second one listed here from the registry

236
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,860
a Seagate two and a half inch laptop

237
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,279
size spinning hard drive and you can see

238
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,980
on the right I've got the actual serial

239
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,459
number right off the label of the device

240
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,240
right from Seagate from the factory

241
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,000
so clearly it's got a serial number

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,399
Seagate gave it a serial number

243
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,440
does that serial number look like the

244
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,720
serial number on the screen in the

245
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,860
registry

246
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,579
and the answer is no

247
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:39,899
hmm

248
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,480
this is going to become problematic

249
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
okay

250
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,100
now that serial number on the Seagate

251
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,519
drive that WCC one and whatever else it

252
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,519
is I want you to keep that in mind

253
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,920
and I've even put it in the top right

254
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,860
corner of the next few slides so that

255
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,740
you can reference it

256
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,140
I took that hard drive

257
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,740
and I plugged it right into

258
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,500
the computer and when I say plugged in I

259
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,800
mean hard line into the motherboard

260
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,839
right through a SATA cable

261
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,399
SATA power

262
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,779
straight into a channel on the

263
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,060
motherboard as though it was a booting

264
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,440
hard drive

265
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,980
and then I look to see how it identifies

266
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,079
well in device manager it shows up

267
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,240
exactly as it is an st-2000

268
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,180
lm007 and the model number

269
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,320
I ran a program called G Smart Control

270
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,440
which accesses the smart area of a hard

271
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
drive's firmware beyond the scope of

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,100
what we're talking about but it gives us

273
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,899
information about the drive that's the

274
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,399
takeaway

275
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
and it gives us the serial number and it

276
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,560
gives us the correct serial number so

277
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,079
everything's working just fine when this

278
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,880
hard drive is plugged directly into the

279
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,240
motherboard

280
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,980
but how often do we take our external

281
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,600
drives and plug them directly into the

282
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,820
motherboard we don't right that's would

283
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,620
defeat the purpose of having an external

284
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,940
drive

285
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,579
so now let's look at some of the

286
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,680
different ways we might

287
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,860
connect an external drive to our

288
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
computers and one of the ways the first

289
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,760
method that I looked at was with a

290
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,779
toaster

291
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,519
so we've got this toaster here

292
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,079
and I take that drive and I put it in

293
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,060
the toaster now the toaster is connected

294
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,639
to the computer as USB

295
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,040
and we can see here

296
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,500
now the model as far as the device

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,560
manager is concerned just a little bit

298
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,519
different

299
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,339
and you might not even first notice the

300
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,320
nuances here one of the first nuances

301
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,360
there's a space between the m and the

302
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,740
zero zero seven

303
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,660
and at the end of that model number it

304
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,459
says scuzzy disk device they didn't say

305
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,880
that before

306
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,019
then when we look at it in g-smart

307
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,639
control

308
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,779
ah what happened to our serial number

309
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,760
hold on a second Kevin

310
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,500
you mean to tell me that you plugged

311
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,839
that same hard drive into a toaster and

312
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,399
into the machine

313
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,139
and now it's saying the serial number

314
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:18,540
something different yeah that's exactly

315
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,880
what I'm saying because on the top right

316
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,399
is a reminder of what the serial number

317
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,959
of that hard drive really is

318
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,760
take away number one then

319
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,800
here in our test session we're lucky

320
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,339
enough to know what the real serial

321
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,399
number of that hard drive is

322
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,860
and yet if we were doing forensics on a

323
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,480
computer that it would be was plugged

324
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,500
into

325
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,300
that serial number there is what we

326
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,500
would have said the serial number is

327
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,459
and we would be wrong

328
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,940
we'll talk more about that in a minute

329
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,940
so while it was plugged into the toaster

330
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,040
I ran a Powershell command that same one

331
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,800
that I had on the screen earlier

332
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,899
it shows us what it thinks the serial

333
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,519
number is

334
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,100
it shows us what the device ID is or

335
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,980
what it thinks it is

336
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,760
Ampersand is a second character clearly

337
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,040
let's not have a serial number

338
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,740
Windows is trying to help me out

339
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,860
Windows is lying to me neither of those

340
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,320
is the serial number of my hard drive

341
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,760
but the registry

342
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,279
tells me that this serial number is

343
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,459
actually that six Ampersand which we

344
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,880
know not to be true

345
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,320
well let's try something different

346
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,660
because really how many people throw

347
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,180
drives into a toaster I do it all the

348
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,139
time

349
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,060
but maybe a lot of users don't maybe

350
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,519
they use adapters so we have this

351
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,579
adapter it's a SATA adapter SATA to USB

352
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,880
I plug the SATA end into my laptop drive

353
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,160
the one we used for testing then I plug

354
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,579
it in as usb2 these are USB 3. these are

355
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,459
just pass-through devices that's all

356
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,560
they are they're a method of accessing

357
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,779
the data on the hard drive surely they

358
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,180
can't be changing things

359
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,760
well first of all don't call me Shirley

360
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,220
and absolutely

361
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,380
they're changing things

362
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,120
let's have a look at how they're

363
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,040
changing things and there's many

364
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,720
different makes and models of these

365
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,199
adapters we plug it in we run our

366
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,880
Powershell command

367
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,300
ah serial number it's the right serial

368
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,519
number

369
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,139
we gotta win

370
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,380
and then we look at the device ID

371
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,620
wait a minute that eight Ampersand is

372
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,560
not the same as what we just had was it

373
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,199
previously it was a six ampersand

374
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
okay because Kevin

375
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,300
doesn't know when to quit

376
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,839
Kevin goes and gets a second

377
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,099
SATA to USB adapter same make same model

378
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,319
same everything it's an apricorn it's

379
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,240
identical to the other one I just happen

380
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,099
to have a drawer full of them

381
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,859
so I take a second one I plug that same

382
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,500
hard drive into a second one

383
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,740
serial number entirely different

384
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,939
device ID entirely different

385
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:30,360
neither of them is our serial number

386
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,660
so what do you think Kevin does next

387
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:39,440
Kevin ghost does it with a third adapter

388
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,580
and again

389
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,240
another different serial number

390
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,059
and another different device ID

391
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,280
if you were looking at this computer in

392
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,919
a forensic analysis you would swear by

393
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,840
everything holy that there was three

394
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,700
separate devices plugged into this

395
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,720
machine

396
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
and there was not it was a single device

397
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,799
with three different adapters

398
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,299
what did you put in your report

399
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,940
three hard drives

400
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,360
six different metrics only one of them

401
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,799
is correct

402
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,260
okay okay what that's making my head

403
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,220
hurt

404
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,440
so so let's get away from that because

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,700
really how many people use asada to USB

406
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,260
adapter

407
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,720
everybody that's taken forensics 498

408
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,660
because we give them out

409
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,580
but let's look at this

410
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,580
like the more average normal user

411
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,580
because some of you are saying Kevin

412
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,000
that's great but let's stop with these

413
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,580
fabricated examples

414
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,760
that you're trying to use to

415
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,740
sensationalize this

416
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,840
and believe me when I'm sitting where

417
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,640
you're sitting and somebody is up here

418
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,020
trying to sell me on some fabricated

419
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,559
special scenario like did you know you

420
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,280
can hide data in the firmware area of a

421
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,720
hard drive

422
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,419
and everybody goes

423
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,240
and I say yeah I know but uh

424
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,700
yeah how many people have the Thirteen

425
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,559
thousand dollar program that'll allow

426
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,799
them to do that and the knowledge let's

427
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,620
talk about what's happening today not

428
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,840
what might happen I'm that guy in the

429
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,520
front row that'll ask that dumb question

430
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,900
anyway so let's get to devices

431
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,620
average person is using

432
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,860
Samsung T5 external drive solid state

433
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,900
the only thing that's better than this

434
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,380
in my opinion is the Samsung t7

435
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,340
but it is normal Drive plugs in USB it

436
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,620
will plug in normal USB it will plug in

437
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,660
USBC when you buy them they've got

438
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,179
cables for both

439
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,520
on the case

440
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,419
it's got the serial number

441
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,220
s4b4 whatever whatever

442
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,220
when I download and run the Samsung

443
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,280
Drive software

444
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,280
it also tells me that's the serial

445
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,600
number

446
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,039
ah

447
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,880
finally finally we have things that

448
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,860
agree with each other

449
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,379
until we plug it into the computer

450
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,100
what we have on the left is g g Smart

451
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,600
Control version 1.1.3

452
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,299
look what it says the serial number is

453
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:51,360
doesn't look like that s4b thing

454
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,520
now fortunately on the right hand side

455
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
you see I updated g-smart control to

456
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,539
1.1.4 and it does show me the right

457
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:03,140
serial number

458
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
okay great

459
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,120
how many people would ever think that

460
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,919
this software

461
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,440
would give different serial numbers for

462
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,880
the same device based on its version

463
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,120
and hey this is all cool Kevin

464
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,660
but you know what the only reason that

465
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,900
version 1.1.4

466
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,260
means anything to us in terms of showing

467
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,880
the right serial number

468
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,179
is only because we know

469
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,020
what the right serial number is

470
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,179
because we plugged that drive in

471
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,100
how many times in your forensic

472
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,900
investigations are you the person who

473
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,140
plugged the drive in never that's why

474
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,460
you're here

475
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,860
because somebody wants to know what

476
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,100
happened

477
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,320
did you know that your G Smart Control

478
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,840
wasn't giving you the right serial

479
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,700
number

480
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,440
it's easy to see the right serial number

481
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,179
when you're the one that created the

482
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,380
artifact

483
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,299
but as an investigator you're not the

484
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,880
one that created the artifact

485
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,700
when we look at that same Drive in

486
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,679
Powershell

487
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,900
once again

488
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,880
neither of them are this serial number

489
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,919
of the device

490
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,200
okay all right

491
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,500
so let's go to our old school we've got

492
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,559
that big Seagate brick of a drive that

493
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,900
we bought at Staples

494
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,600
USB 3

495
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,419
on the box serial number

496
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:46,919
November Alpha 8 4 F whatever whatever

497
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,179
that's the serial number

498
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,740
no it's not

499
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,780
when we look at it in power shell it

500
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,640
says that's the serial number fair

501
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,260
enough

502
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,020
but then it gives us this device ID that

503
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,500
has an ampersand as the second character

504
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,380
do you honestly believe that Seagate did

505
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,900
not give this a serial number

506
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,640
because according to everything we've

507
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,100
ever been being told if the Ampersand is

508
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,419
a second character

509
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:18,179
there's no serial number for the device

510
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,260
well clearly there is

511
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,059
hmm

512
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,919
they're both wrong

513
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,419
why if you take that plastic case that

514
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,820
the serial number was written on and you

515
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,679
tear it apart and you take the hard

516
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,679
drive out this is the hard drive that

517
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,620
was inside that plastic enclosure

518
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,679
it is a Seagate hard drive it's got a

519
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,720
serial number and that's not the serial

520
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,860
number that was on the case

521
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,440
so

522
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,700
what does that mean for us

523
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,280
what are you putting in your report

524
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,100
what impact does this have legally

525
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,380
and forensically

526
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,500
show of hands in the room you can do it

527
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,539
in cyberland at home put your hand up I

528
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,740
won't be able to see you but I'll

529
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,360
believe that you're actually doing it

530
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,179
how many people in the room here

531
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,400
law enforcement

532
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,020
put your hands up

533
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,460
if you want to

534
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,260
no law enforcement in the room okay I

535
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,240
got a few yeah yeah I got a few

536
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,059
okay so if you're not law enforcement

537
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:31,980
how many in the room

538
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,159
doing investigations

539
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,059
in the criminal or civil Realm

540
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,440
yeah a lot more hands

541
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,120
how does this impact your investigation

542
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,260
now

543
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,679
because you have written reports in the

544
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,480
past you don't have to put up your hands

545
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,120
for this one but I know it's happened I

546
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,159
won't get you to embarrass yourself

547
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,919
you have written reports that said this

548
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,740
user plugged in this device at this date

549
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,780
and time and here's the make model and

550
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,900
serial number and they have not turned

551
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,120
that device over pursuant to our

552
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,940
production order

553
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,299
maybe you even went further and in a

554
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,059
court of law challenged that they were

555
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,880
withholding evidence and they're saying

556
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,140
I didn't I gave you everything

557
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,940
no you didn't

558
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,740
because we can see the serial number

559
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,260
right here

560
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,799
if this is not scaring a few people or

561
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
making a few people just a little bit

562
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,059
uncomfortable

563
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,220
maybe you're in the wrong profession

564
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,220
we looked at this drive in g-smart

565
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,380
control and it did get serial number

566
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,760
right

567
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,460
but we're we're happy with that

568
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,960
but then we looked at the Windows Event

569
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,679
log and it had the serial number of the

570
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,600
plastic enclosure

571
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,840
not the drive itself

572
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,340
so then what are you investigating are

573
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,440
you investigating a hard drive or are

574
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,100
you investigating the plastic enclosure

575
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,679
I can tell you that I swap out the hard

576
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,559
drives in my plastic enclosures

577
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,299
frequently

578
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,779
on an as needed basis

579
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,240
now the one good thing that I found in

580
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,159
all of my testing that was consistent

581
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:30,779
the whole time was

582
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,140
no matter what windows

583
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,740
said was the serial number

584
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,900
whatever that thing was was consistent

585
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,600
throughout all of the artifacts in all

586
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,100
of the different places in the registry

587
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,140
so if it said it was that eight

588
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,659
Ampersand one two three four

589
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:55,380
it said that throughout all of the other

590
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,500
artifacts relative to that device

591
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,520
problem is

592
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
where are you going to find that device

593
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,260
because that thing with the ampersand

594
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,840
is going to change

595
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,080
each time you plug the device into a

596
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,799
different USB port on the computer

597
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,980
in fact depending on the computer and

598
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,620
the version of Windows it may change

599
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,179
plugging it into the same USB port again

600
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:32,760
and we haven't given it a second thought

601
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,820
because we've always been told that's

602
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,779
the serial number

603
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,820
now you might say well Okay Kevin but

604
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,580
it's consistent so yeah maybe we

605
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,020
shouldn't be calling it a serial number

606
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,279
but really what's the big deal

607
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,240
I don't think I need to explain to

608
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,059
anybody here how big a deal terminology

609
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,760
is

610
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,020
terminology is critical if you call

611
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,140
something a serial number it better be

612
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,740
that unique identifier issued by the

613
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,559
manufacturer

614
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,520
and not some different artifact that

615
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,640
windows or some other tool told you is

616
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,480
the serial number

617
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,400
so what do we call it I don't even know

618
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,960
what to call it

619
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,260
maybe we should call it a Windows

620
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,500
assigned device identification

621
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,700
maybe that would be a better term for it

622
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,299
because in that way we are now saying

623
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:45,179
hey Windows issued this identifier at

624
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:48,360
the time the device was plugged in

625
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,620
it behooves you as examiners to put into

626
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,659
your report

627
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,059
even just a small paragraph about this

628
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:02,820
especially if you don't have the actual

629
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,159
device anymore that had been plugged in

630
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,640
to do testing with

631
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,179
otherwise what are you saying

632
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,340
about your investigation

633
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,940
and what effect might that have on the

634
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,159
person you're doing the investigation

635
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,779
against or on

636
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,799
or for

637
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,159
anybody who's taken a Sans class

638
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,220
has had it drilled into their head I

639
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,279
don't care which curriculum I don't care

640
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:45,179
if it's 498 500 572 585 pick your class

641
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,480
pick your number pick your alphabet soup

642
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,380
I know every single instructor has told

643
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,960
you more than once

644
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,340
don't blindly trust your tools

645
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,059
trust but verify

646
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,299
we have to do this it's great to use a

647
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,340
tool to make what we're doing more

648
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,899
efficient

649
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:14,039
but what's more important than even that

650
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,919
understand how your tool is getting the

651
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:19,860
information that it's getting I often

652
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,520
get asked

653
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,799
Kevin what about usb detective what is

654
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:29,179
it showing when you do this

655
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,520
I don't know

656
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,860
I did not use USB detective in my run of

657
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,840
testing

658
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,779
I was so far down the rabbit hole

659
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:45,539
and making myself more and more and more

660
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,760
confused as I went

661
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,020
it didn't even cross my mind to use USB

662
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,860
detective to see what it was saying

663
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,100
I will cautiously suggest

664
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,240
that based on my use of USB detective I

665
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,100
would suggest that it's going to show

666
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,640
that Windows device ID

667
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,260
I don't think it's going to get the

668
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,539
serial number right either and I say

669
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,820
that because I have a relatively good

670
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,940
idea where USB detective is getting its

671
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,500
artifacts from

672
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,159
and those places are going to have that

673
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:27,059
Windows device ID not the actual serial

674
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,140
number

675
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,220
this is scary

676
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,840
you know

677
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,620
it's great when you write a report and

678
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,620
nobody asks any questions

679
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,500
now you sound like a genius good thing

680
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,720
we brought the expert in paid them all

681
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,000
this money we got exactly what it was we

682
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,559
needed

683
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,620
but it becomes quite uncomfortable

684
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,080
if you're on the stand

685
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
or you're sitting in a room during

686
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,520
depositions or interrogatories or even

687
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,919
just being questioned by your manager

688
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,740
while somebody else is on the other side

689
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,240
listening

690
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,779
and they say to you

691
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,640
are you sure that's a serial number

692
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,580
or could it just be a device ID

693
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,539
did you examine the hard drive or did

694
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,100
you examine the enclosure

695
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:29,000
if you're anything like me

696
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,640
you wonder where that question came from

697
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,919
because a lawyer is not asking you a

698
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,480
random question just for giggles

699
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,299
and that's when the sweat starts right

700
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,460
about here

701
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,980
because you know they know something

702
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,500
that maybe you missed

703
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,120
and things are going to start getting

704
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,659
very uncomfortable

705
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:56,700
folks

706
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,799
what you do matters

707
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,559
I can't stress this enough

708
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:06,779
I don't care

709
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,760
what area

710
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,880
you are doing digital forensics in I

711
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,679
don't care if you're law enforcement I

712
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,539
don't care if you're government I don't

713
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,000
care if you're a contractor if you're a

714
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,159
consultant I don't care if you're doing

715
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,559
digital forensics on an internal team

716
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,320
for your company as part of instant

717
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,240
response

718
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
digital forensics especially

719
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,440
above any other computer related

720
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,260
industry or profession

721
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,740
has the ability to change lives

722
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,539
your report has the ability

723
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:47,760
to impart

724
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,580
remove someone's freedoms put them in

725
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,699
jail

726
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,240
get them fired

727
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:01,140
you hold an immense amount of power

728
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,779
and if you don't approach every single

729
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:06,000
investigation with that amount of power

730
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
in mind

731
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,460
Starbucks is always hiring Baristas

732
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,119
what you do matters and you need to

733
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,260
investigate like it does it was easy to

734
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,379
see the problems we had because we knew

735
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,480
what the device was that we had plugged

736
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,260
in

737
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,060
when you're doing an investigation

738
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,480
people are asking you what was plugged

739
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,800
in

740
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,119
what are you telling them

741
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,060
if you want to see a little bit more of

742
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,859
that in detail and who knows maybe a

743
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,300
whole bunch of other forensic stuff just

744
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,359
for Giggles I really didn't have a whole

745
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,940
lot to do during covid so I happened to

746
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,560
bang out oh how many 200 videos

747
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,040
okay three minutes max three minute

748
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,040
videos on just a ton of things forensic

749
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,740
techniques procedures knowledge on

750
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,619
digital forensics and and

751
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:08,160
um

752
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,859
information security

753
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,540
and the reason I picked three minutes

754
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,119
was because everybody's doing one hour

755
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,440
things

756
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,000
and how many people have set through a

757
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,040
one-hour webinar going

758
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,560
that wasn't what I thought it was

759
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,859
can't get that hour back

760
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,900
everybody's got three minutes

761
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,619
come on there's things everybody does at

762
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:34,320
least once every day that takes you at

763
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,880
least three minutes

764
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,520
and you could be doing this too

765
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,260
and if there's nothing in there that was

766
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,060
of Interest it was only three minutes

767
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,540
folks

768
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,820
I know that every everybody who gets up

769
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,000
here and talks says the same thing

770
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,020
I'm gonna say it because I truly mean it

771
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,420
if you have any questions

772
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,599
if you want to do research but don't

773
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,760
know where to start or where to get your

774
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,060
research put reach out to me

775
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,520
I will help you

776
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,180
we need researchers take what I've done

777
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,540
in this talk and go further do testing

778
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,760
maybe maybe your research project is

779
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,460
everything I did but with the tools that

780
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,859
we're all using what does NK say about

781
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:25,500
this what does ftk say about this what

782
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,780
does USB detective say about this that

783
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,660
could be its own research project

784
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,880
you do the research I'll help you put it

785
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,980
into a paper I'll help you get it posted

786
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,619
because we all need to know

787
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,180
last thing I have to say

788
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,460
Grayson says go flames

789
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,090
[Applause]

790
