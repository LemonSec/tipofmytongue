1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
ER was saying as we were walking up here

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,300
that I dressed the part this is my

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,880
iPhone shirt that's been wiped so it

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,699
says it's obliterated

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,260
so we're going to start this afternoon

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,240
with our presentation what's up with

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,520
your iMessage dude this one is going to

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,080
cover all the things that you never

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,539
really thought about with imessage and

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,800
WhatsApp

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,900
predominantly we use these all the time

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,600
in our investigations but the question

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,059
always comes back to well yeah but how

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,880
did it get there or why is it not there

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,079
so we're going to try to figure out if

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,219
we can find that out

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,000
but before we do that Stacy yeah that's

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,100
a little question for you yes did you

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,100
know that there is an actor who was in

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,840
Top Gun specifically the volleyball

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,000
scene of Top Gun who would later go on

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,719
to star with Tom Hanks and Castaway

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,340
I had no idea

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,079
yeah

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,600
sorry that is awful

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
I should just let you continue the

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,619
presentation from here I have to have a

29
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:08,580
little fun

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,820
yeah so on that note

31
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,280
uh my name is Stacy Randolph

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,439
um I am a director at straws Friedberg

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,040
now and Cyber Solutions uh we go by both

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,860
names so whatever you want to call it

35
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,380
um these are my babies

36
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,200
my two Akitas uh the fluffy one is Piper

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,720
and the other one who is missing an eye

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,700
now is Zeus

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,100
um they're adorable in everything

40
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,119
uh Hobbies of mine are

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,619
in no order uh mental health self-care

42
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,079
um advocating all of that I've actually

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,000
turned one of the bedrooms in my house

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,920
into a home Spa with a sauna so uh I'm

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,899
sorry no one is allowed in my house

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,500
that's mine uh brisket of course Texas

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,840
is great for brisket

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
um all things animals do not send me the

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,240
eight-legged creepy crawler thingies

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,179
um I will block you on slack sorry

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,040
um and then we just hit last month uh

52
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,680
the five year anniversary of D for fit

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,360
so that's exciting

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,840
not quite as exciting but I'm

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,060
Christopher Vance I am the uh currently

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,620
the senior technical forensic specialist

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,420
at Magnet forensics

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,640
um I am a father to a pair of control C

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,180
control V's my twins and uh you know I

60
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,580
like tacos Disney long walks on the

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,680
beach and then pretty much anything done

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,420
by Guy Fieri

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,220
getting on with the actual point of this

64
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,900
talk I know it's been a while we're

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,400
going to talk about ios's two most

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,900
popular chat apps and we're going to

67
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,640
talk about messages first and then we're

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,160
going to go over to WhatsApp so why is

69
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,280
messages so big well Apple says you have

70
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,019
to use it we don't really have a choice

71
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:00,360
but coming from an artifact company I

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,519
can tell you that WhatsApp is number two

73
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,480
with that

74
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,519
but why these two together

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,080
they share a lot of the same

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,599
functionality they share the ability to

77
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,540
share media to share your locations to

78
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,819
do group messaging and control replies

79
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,940
and reactions they both have a really

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,959
bad habit of making data go away

81
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,540
so for uh iMessage or the messages app

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,920
specifically of course Apple's gonna

83
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,680
Force this as the default protocol for

84
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,260
all of iMessages certain on iOS and of

85
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,720
course Mac OS but also all text messages

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,780
so SMS and MMS are forced through that

87
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,519
same application it's not like Android

88
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,920
where you can actually pick and choose

89
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,620
well with that that is going to give us

90
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,000
a lot of different settings that are

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,739
going to impact both Apple's own

92
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,140
iMessages but the predominant way that

93
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,060
well most folks actually communicate

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,799
when it comes to a phone anymore who

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,420
would ever think about using a phone to

96
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,620
call somebody

97
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,500
but the data for iMessage doesn't just

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,840
exist in the one database that we all

99
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,120
have come to know and trust there's

100
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
actually data outside of that database

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
that can help you fill in some of the

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,940
missing pieces

103
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,799
the database that we've all used for

104
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
years is smsdb now this has not ever as

105
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
far as I'm aware moved since the early

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,738
early days of iPhone OS it has been in

107
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,220
private VAR mobile Library SMS

108
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,199
the schema of course has changed quite a

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
few times this has always been available

110
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,460
to us in an iTunes style backup or in an

111
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,860
AFU or better file system

112
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,740
this may or may not

113
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,040
be present in an iCloud backup depending

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,320
upon specific settings that we're going

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
to evaluate today

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,580
there's a lot of tables I mean like a

117
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,360
lot

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,940
in fact there are probably about seven

119
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,080
tables that you're going to care about

120
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
in every case

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,820
four of those tables are going to be the

122
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,919
actual important data but because Apple

123
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,660
believes strongly in relational

124
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,600
databases many of those tables are not

125
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,120
linked directly to each other they have

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,400
what are referred to as join tables so

127
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
the data is actually going to run

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,820
through this other join table before

129
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,160
they go over with that now this does

130
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,220
provide storage efficiency but it also

131
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,020
causes a lot of issues with the with

132
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,060
deleted messages specifically

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,440
fragmentation

134
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,139
you'll recover pieces of the message but

135
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,240
not the whole picture

136
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
so how does Apple keep track of all

137
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,199
these messages especially when we have

138
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,419
to deal with things like syncing between

139
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,539
multiple devices and a cloud service

140
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,880
apple does not care at all about the row

141
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,820
ID of your database and in two different

142
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,979
devices that are both syncing to the

143
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,860
same service those row IDs are going to

144
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,020
be totally different what Apple cares

145
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,900
about instead is the good value this

146
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,160
same pattern is used all over iOS this

147
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,259
84412 pattern Apple's going to use this

148
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,740
to uniquely track each message

149
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,240
regardless of what device it's actually

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,020
sent to or sent from

151
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,880
this is going to be really important for

152
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,860
tracking some of the reactions and

153
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,020
replies but then there's also dates and

154
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,840
times now Apple

155
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
continues to Annoy Us with dates and

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,320
times they cannot make up their mind

157
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,639
about how they're going to store dates

158
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,979
and times in this database many moons

159
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,680
ago it was a Unix timestamp then it was

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,479
an apple time timestamp and then it was

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,940
Apple time in seconds with decimal

162
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,979
points and now it's actually stored for

163
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,180
the most part in nanoseconds but you may

164
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,520
see a mixture of both nanosec and apple

165
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
time as well as second Apple time with

166
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,000
multiple decimal points depending upon

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,460
the service that's used and the

168
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,560
directionality because both of those can

169
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
impact which of the three time stamps in

170
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,860
the database you're actually going to

171
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,180
have

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,639
so how do we track replies well one of

173
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,600
the things that I wanted to look at

174
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,940
first was multi-part messages because

175
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,039
every once in a while I have to text one

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,560
of those green people those Android

177
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,380
users and unfortunately when I do that

178
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,500
it defaults down to an SMS and when they

179
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,120
send me a long enough message that

180
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,400
message can often get broken apart

181
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,020
so how does Apple put it all back

182
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,860
together

183
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,780
this is where the good comes into play

184
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,840
and there is a function there uh sorry

185
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,340
there is a column there in the database

186
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,580
called reply to guide that reply to go

187
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,500
it shows you which message that was to

188
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,139
reply to Now by default the reply to

189
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,880
guide is just going to be the message

190
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,120
that came before it in the database

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,380
however

192
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,539
there is a little bit more that goes

193
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,099
into that part

194
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,319
replies and threads which came out a few

195
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,599
versions ago really kind of starts to

196
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,220
confuse this a little bit

197
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,160
so visually the user might see something

198
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,500
like this on the screen where you have a

199
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,240
line that says oh yeah I'm replying to

200
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,280
this message or and that could be a

201
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,319
reply to that message reply to an image

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,539
it doesn't really matter

203
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,419
what Apple will track in the database is

204
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,919
the guide

205
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,139
the reply to do it again

206
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,380
but what if you have a multiple thread

207
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,560
of replies in a single message how do

208
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,940
you know which one was the beginning

209
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,979
message there because Apple shows it

210
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,419
visually on the screen

211
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,400
that's going to be the column thread

212
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,080
originator guide

213
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,900
this is important because if a user

214
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,940
deletes a message

215
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,400
they may have deleted a message that

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,440
still contains a reply

217
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,060
and you might be able to say we know

218
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,059
this was to a reply because the good is

219
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,099
missing and we can actually track that

220
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,539
in there

221
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,120
then we have reactions you can like a

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,299
message you can unlike a message or you

223
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,300
can actually miss click and remove that

224
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,260
reaction

225
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,899
each one of these reactions is actually

226
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,420
a separate record in the database

227
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,300
visually it's just a little circle

228
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,279
but in the database it's an entire new

229
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,120
record

230
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,339
and here's the problem

231
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,560
there's only one visible record per

232
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,240
person at a time

233
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,580
so if somebody say likes an image

234
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,860
realizes that was the wrong one to do

235
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,779
and then unlikes the image puts the

236
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,980
thumbs down

237
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,959
there's going to be a missing record in

238
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
the database

239
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,680
apple is going to say they like that

240
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,959
image oh wait no they didn't and they're

241
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,060
gonna say they did not like that image

242
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,519
you're going to see gaps in both the row

243
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,339
ID as well as the guide on the screen if

244
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,720
you may be able to see this we have this

245
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,120
graphic in the middle row ID 178 or one

246
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,600
set 147 148 but then down here at the

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
bottom we have 93.95 that's because

248
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
somebody decided to laugh at that image

249
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,720
and then they removed the laugh

250
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,260
the removal of the laugh is tracked

251
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,420
but the actual originating laugh itself

252
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,300
got dropped from the database

253
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,339
we also have expressive messages and

254
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,480
balloons this is one of my favorite

255
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,940
things that Apple's done it allows me to

256
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,339
send messages in a different way of

257
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,320
course my favorite one to do is to text

258
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,660
somebody the words pew pew because it's

259
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,860
you know going to send the little space

260
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,620
lasers out or you can set somebody like

261
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,600
congrats and that's going to generate

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,180
the balloons and confetti right well

263
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,860
each one of these things are tracked but

264
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,620
apple is taking that a step further you

265
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,300
may have noticed when you send something

266
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,720
to someone it may generate almost like a

267
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
preview window of what you're looking at

268
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,860
a preview of the website that you're

269
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,500
looking at that is referred to as apple

270
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,560
as a balloon and you will actually see a

271
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,080
binary P list embedded in the blob as

272
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,360
part of this payload data we can parse

273
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,279
that out to get additional records

274
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,500
meaning that one of my favorite things

275
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,560
to do in the world is carve this the SMS

276
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,100
database for binary plist to see what

277
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,680
really was there at one point in time

278
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,560
we can also send via Siri now visibly

279
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,620
there is a record for incoming messages

280
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,200
sent by Siri but what if you have a

281
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,399
distracted driving case where someone

282
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,860
says I didn't actually send that message

283
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,839
I use Siri to send it

284
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,300
visibly on the phone we would know but

285
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,920
in the database

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,720
inside of this there is once again

287
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,600
another embedded binary P list which

288
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,579
contains an identifier that lets us know

289
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,920
incoming and outgoing is going to be

290
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,200
sent by Siri

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,959
group threads is where things get really

292
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,160
complicated

293
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,279
because there's no direct correlation

294
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,160
between a single message and a user I

295
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
mean there's the handle ID great but

296
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,420
what happens when that handle ID

297
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,360
actually reflects zero

298
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
well I didn't think row ID started at

299
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,279
zero they don't in this case and in fact

300
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,980
zero is a placeholder which means I have

301
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,860
an outgoing group message with that

302
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,600
outgoing group message I've Got to Now

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,820
jump through a bunch of different hoops

304
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,620
to figure out who that message was

305
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,500
actually to the messages table itself is

306
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,380
tied to a join table that joins the

307
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,899
message to the chat the chat itself

308
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,480
tells me who that chat was between which

309
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,000
is joined to another join table which

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,620
tells me which handles are responsible

311
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,180
for being in that chat

312
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,160
which is then tied to the handle table

313
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,220
to tell me who was actually in that chat

314
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,100
this is why for a lot of reasons but a

315
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,420
big one when you have a group message

316
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,820
and it is deleted even if it's recovered

317
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,820
it may be very fragmented there are a

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,459
lot of broken pieces in this chain that

319
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,220
some tools just can't recover

320
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,720
well while we're on the subject of group

321
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,160
messages what else can we do with them

322
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,680
we can actually modify them again as

323
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
long as you're not talking to the green

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,440
people sorry

325
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,060
as long as you're talking to someone

326
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,339
just using the iMessage protocol you

327
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,200
have a lot more functionality I can

328
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,540
rename a room I can add a picture to the

329
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,940
room I can add new people to that chat

330
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,160
without creating a new thread and I can

331
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,500
even remove people or someone can leave

332
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,079
that thread all of these things can be

333
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
tracked but at face value

334
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
it's going to reflect a null value in

335
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,860
the text of the database

336
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,260
but by looking deeper at one of the many

337
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,420
columns that Apple shows we can actually

338
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,600
see things like item type item type is

339
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,980
going to actually help us see in this

340
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,800
case that a group title was changed and

341
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,019
a group message was renamed to moving

342
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,980
company

343
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,279
the next message also null reflects a

344
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,920
group action type of one with an item

345
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,720
type of three

346
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,480
this was the actual adding of an image

347
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,760
to that group thread

348
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,620
not always important in every case but

349
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,360
that's why we're here is to find all the

350
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,519
little weird stuff

351
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,920
now the other problem with that is that

352
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,440
the picture is not necessarily stored

353
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,839
where you would expect it to be

354
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,639
that picture is going to actually end up

355
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,700
in the messages metadata and so if

356
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,279
they've added a picture of somebody that

357
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,899
you're interested in you have to look

358
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,880
outside the standard attachments SMS

359
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,040
database this is a whole new area that

360
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,540
we have to go to

361
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,579
when we invite new people to a group

362
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,320
when people leave a group or we remove

363
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,019
people from a group we know who left who

364
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,959
joined and who may have added them we

365
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,820
can track that with the other handle

366
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,339
column that lets us know who was brought

367
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:17,940
in to that group and by whom we can

368
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,500
actually go down all of these rabbit

369
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,600
holes to see all of these little pieces

370
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,100
of the conversation

371
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,320
but like when dealing with most of the

372
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
things in the group message the text

373
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
value is going to reflect null we cannot

374
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,160
rely on just the text value to figure

375
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,040
out all of these missing pieces

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
if I at somebody this is going to add a

377
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,079
mention to that user but it's not going

378
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,000
to be stored as plainly and clearly in

379
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,800
the database it's actually going to be

380
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
embedded within a blob of the database

381
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,639
referred to as the attributed body now

382
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,959
there's been some great research already

383
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
but I'm telling you this is the column

384
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,660
to watch in iOS 16. more on that I'm

385
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,399
sure but that is the column you're

386
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,699
really going to want to watch in iOS 16.

387
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,500
how about auto replies we talked about

388
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,380
distracted driving and sent by Siri but

389
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,199
what if someone says oh I uh I never saw

390
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,779
that text message I never I I had

391
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,639
driving focus on I couldn't have seen

392
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,019
that text message

393
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,660
well Apple actually added with Focus the

394
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,220
ability to silence incoming

395
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,079
notifications and they got really

396
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,180
passive aggressive about it and said hey

397
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,040
this person uh it has notifications

398
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
silence do you want to notify anyway and

399
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,240
when you say yes it does the loud slam

400
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,440
animation

401
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,579
I feel like Apple's being a little pass

402
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:32,339
impressive with that but that is also

403
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,040
tracked two Boolean values in that

404
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,560
message database reflect if that was an

405
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,380
auto reply uh say for like a focused

406
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,620
message was it delivered quietly and

407
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,300
even if it was delivered quietly did the

408
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,399
user say no no no no

409
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,160
I want to annoy them and actually press

410
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,660
that message I wouldn't know anything

411
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,779
about that yeah never audio messages are

412
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,860
another interesting one and this is

413
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,940
where we start to get into some of the

414
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,459
weird preferences audio messages can be

415
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,540
transmitted through the iMessage

416
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,339
protocol and these are going to be short

417
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,040
audio clips but

418
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,779
they have a problem

419
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,600
they automatically expire after two

420
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,240
minutes as soon as it's played it will

421
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,459
expire from that device

422
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,199
and

423
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,320
send a message back to Apple to have

424
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,040
that same audio file expire on the other

425
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,740
device so if I were to send Stacy an

426
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,079
audio message and she listens to it two

427
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,699
minutes after that it's deleted from

428
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,139
both of our devices

429
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,339
if she or I choose to keep that message

430
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,560
the other party is notified

431
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,300
unless

432
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,519
you go into the settings of your

433
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,519
messages and actually change that from

434
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,759
expire after two minutes to expire never

435
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,000
when that's done a record uh you can see

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,040
here private VAR mobile Library

437
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,339
preferences

438
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,300
com.apple.imessage.plist will actually

439
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,360
save a value automatically save audio

440
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,660
messages enabled set to true and that

441
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,400
value means they have at some point in

442
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,859
time change that or they now have it set

443
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,900
so that all audio messages are kept

444
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
indefinitely

445
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,040
attachments are messy upon themselves

446
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,780
because they are tracked in the

447
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,000
attachments table with once again no

448
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,619
direct correlation

449
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,380
this particular table of the database is

450
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,819
then going to be tied to the messages

451
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,520
attachment now Apple does like to do

452
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,740
things efficiently they may only store

453
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,740
one copy of the file even if you sent it

454
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,799
to multiple people but if you send a

455
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,740
file in and out you will have multiple

456
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,419
records in this table for the same

457
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,880
attachment file because they'd to use

458
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,340
that to track directionality by looking

459
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,620
at the path of where that attachment is

460
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,020
stored you can gain context clues around

461
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,059
that attachment because it's going to be

462
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,860
very different in the naming structure

463
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,780
whether that comes from the camera roll

464
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,539
or if I take it manually within the app

465
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,140
or if I do the good old copy and paste

466
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,419
meme steel right love doing that one

467
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:06,059
myself when that happens it's actually

468
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,280
going to go to a temp directory and you

469
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,700
can gain context clues around where the

470
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,039
source was for that attachment image or

471
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,740
whatever file it happens to be

472
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,200
location data is also able to be sent

473
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,700
here and this is going to be stored

474
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,620
differently depending upon if you're

475
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,500
sharing location with another user or if

476
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,380
you're sending a one-time stamp a

477
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,900
one-time stamp is actually saved as a

478
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,260
vCard file a VCF file in the attachments

479
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,520
that reflects a URL pointing to Apple's

480
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,740
maps program with the latitude and

481
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,320
longitude they were standing at now this

482
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,059
is nice because when you send it it's

483
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,460
not like pick your location it actually

484
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,280
just drops a pen and you get a little

485
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,679
bit of location data if that function

486
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,900
was utilized this is actually becoming a

487
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,880
little bit more popular because apple is

488
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,380
trying to get users to do this with

489
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,760
autocomplete

490
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,220
so you get the text message where you at

491
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,860
here click and it'll actually drop that

492
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,780
pin right in there please tell me

493
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,799
somebody remembers that old phone

494
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,120
commercial

495
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,860
how about these different preferences we

496
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,360
talked about the one for the audio

497
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
message but there's a lot of different

498
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,740
preferences for iMessage to track

499
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,919
read receipts some people have read

500
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,840
receipts turned off and I can't tell if

501
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
they've actually read that message or

502
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,120
not

503
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,220
sorry all of those are actually

504
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,140
trackable and you can track whether read

505
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,539
receipts were turned on globally or per

506
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:33,240
user you can also track amazing things

507
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,820
like hey was iMessage in the cloud

508
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,000
enabled now in the ux Apple gives you a

509
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,799
nice little section that says these are

510
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,080
all the services that use iCloud

511
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,120
but there's not really like a matching P

512
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,799
list that says here's all the services

513
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,840
that use iCloud you have to go out and

514
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,220
look at different files and this one

515
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,260
will tell you if iMessage in the cloud

516
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,200
is enabled if so

517
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,080
your iCloud backups will not

518
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,780
contain a copy of the smsdb

519
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,240
but that is managed per device you can

520
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
also figure out who has been pinned to

521
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,380
the top of the uh the top of the message

522
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,780
application maybe frequent contacts very

523
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,280
similar to like tracking the favorites

524
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,919
of a call function to figure out how

525
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
long messages are supposed to be kept

526
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
Now by default messages are kept

527
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,679
indefinitely but you can actually set

528
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,660
messages to automatically expire after

529
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,960
30 days or 365 days

530
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,200
if you change it it will exist in this

531
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
p-list file if there is no record in the

532
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,539
plist file which shows this they've

533
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,460
never changed it from the default it

534
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,440
only exists in the PLS file if they've

535
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,120
changed it at some point in time even if

536
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,740
they change it back

537
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,720
we also have the ability to track sms

538
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,240
forwarding and this is important because

539
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,000
if sms forwarding is turned on

540
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,880
it means that I may have text messages

541
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,799
on a non-cellular device

542
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,020
I might have text messages existing on

543
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,419
an iPad that's Wi-Fi only or a Mac

544
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:58,260
device

545
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,840
and if that's the case I just increased

546
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,280
my chances of finding that data on

547
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,140
another source

548
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,380
so where else can we look for this data

549
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,700
knowledge C has been an amazing find and

550
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,400
I owe a lot of that thanks to Sarah for

551
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,820
finding this data within knowledge C

552
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,919
but we can actually take this deeper

553
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,419
than just knowledge C because knowledge

554
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,160
C was kind of the starting point for

555
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,380
this with knowledge C you can actually

556
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,660
find what's called an application intent

557
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,880
and that application intent actually

558
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,240
stores data about messages including a

559
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,100
lot of times the body of the message and

560
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,860
who that was to and from and time stamps

561
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,100
the problem is is that it's a blob with

562
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,140
a p list inside of it with a Proto buff

563
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,000
inside of it with the actual message

564
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,400
content and it's not fun

565
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,520
it's possible but it's not fun

566
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,980
but the best part is it doesn't just

567
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,280
work for iMessages and SMS now the other

568
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,200
area that we like to track as part of

569
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
this is the biome folder and this has

570
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,320
been getting a lot of popularity

571
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,780
recently the biome folder seems to be

572
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,880
tied to this similar to the series

573
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,280
suggestions but an apple suggestion

574
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,559
service and it also tracks these

575
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
application intents

576
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,340
the problem is that when you delete a

577
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,620
message not only will Apple delete that

578
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,600
message from the database they'll

579
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,720
actually go back into knowledge C and

580
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,460
delete the application intent from there

581
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,780
too

582
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,520
but they have not seemed to be doing

583
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,100
that much to the biome folder so from

584
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,980
this binary file we can pull out a

585
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,980
protobuf with a p list in it with

586
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,440
sometimes another P list in it with a

587
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,720
Proto buff in it that does eventually

588
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,880
contain really important information

589
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,240
like what application was used the

590
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,520
message content and even the title of

591
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,440
say the group now while this works for

592
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,559
iMessage and SMS it also works for other

593
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,520
apps like Snapchat for example long

594
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,740
after the Snaps are gone

595
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,299
the biome still has them and it also has

596
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,080
apps like WhatsApp

597
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,340
thank you Chris

598
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,159
my turn to talk now

599
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:12,600
all right so now that we're going to

600
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
move on to Whatsapp you'll see that

601
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,240
there's going to be a lot of

602
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,340
similarities between some of the

603
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,740
functionality with imessage and then

604
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,240
also some of the other functionality

605
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,740
with like

606
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,520
Instagram or Facebook because

607
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,360
Facebook purchased WhatsApp so they all

608
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,000
kind of merge things what's up is still

609
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,640
controlled by its own team still does

610
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
its own development is still separate

611
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,419
from Facebook but Facebook's now their

612
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,520
parent company

613
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,580
um so like iMessage it is a third-party

614
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,320
application that does offer end-to-end

615
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,900
encryption it that works with the

616
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,820
messaging it allows audio and video

617
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,120
calls group chats status updates a whole

618
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,400
bunch of other stuff

619
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,039
um there are separate settings for data

620
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,280
retention for any of the backups privacy

621
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,440
settings and you can do disappearing

622
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,780
messages on it that is a relatively

623
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,059
newer feature

624
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,960
most of the message data itself is

625
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,299
thankfully stored in one database in the

626
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,000
chat storage sqlite table or database

627
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,460
itself but there are

628
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,000
tons and tons of other files and some

629
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,039
new databases that are out there that

630
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,980
still need research done on them that

631
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,559
you can also examine

632
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,260
so starting with privacy settings uh

633
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,440
WhatsApp this is similar to the Facebook

634
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,080
like functionality in that when you

635
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,940
share something with somebody you can

636
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,460
set your privacy settings to share

637
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,100
publicly with everyone

638
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,520
you can selectively share to your entire

639
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,140
set of contacts

640
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,260
you can share with Selective individuals

641
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,780
within your contacts or you can just

642
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,220
decide I don't want to share this with

643
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,320
anybody so nobody needs to see when I

644
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,840
was last online with WhatsApp nobody

645
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,539
needs to see my profile photo or my bio

646
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,659
or what groups I belong to

647
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:10,740
um that's some of the stuff that you can

648
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,100
share with other people if you choose to

649
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,520
status updates these are similar to

650
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,980
Instagram stories

651
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,500
and that they expire after 24 hours

652
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,659
um but same thing you can share those

653
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,419
selectively with individual people

654
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:34,380
um there is a giant P list and we don't

655
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,419
have a screenshot of the PLS just there

656
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,460
is way too much data in it you'll just

657
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,020
trust me

658
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,900
um but there is a p list that stores all

659
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
of this information for you so if you

660
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,600
want to go find out you know was this

661
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,640
person sharing their status update with

662
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,580
a certain individual or is there a

663
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,200
likelihood that somebody could have seen

664
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,179
this information out there checking the

665
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,679
P list you might be able to find it

666
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,440
there

667
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,980
backups

668
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,620
backups can get tricky there are a lot

669
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,320
of settings in WhatsApp backups that

670
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,500
also relate to iCloud backups

671
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,919
so you can set by default

672
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,840
auto backups are turned off

673
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,400
WhatsApp will not create a backup for

674
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,539
you

675
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,179
you can change it to create a backup of

676
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,400
all of your data 24 hours

677
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,080
after one week

678
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,299
after a month 30 days roughly 30 days

679
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,580
um you can include whether you want

680
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,000
videos in that backup or not

681
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,700
so if you have limited iCloud space but

682
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,980
you want to save your chat messages

683
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,440
maybe turn off Backup with videos and

684
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,240
that will shrink your backup size down

685
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,400
you do have that option

686
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,340
the other option you have is you can

687
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,480
encrypt that backup separately with a

688
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,520
completely different password before

689
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,100
that gets sent up to iCloud

690
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,919
now if you forget that password

691
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
you are out of luck

692
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,600
Apple cannot recover it WhatsApp cannot

693
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,900
recover it it is gone you cannot restore

694
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,260
any of the data from that

695
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,100
the other thing to note is if you turn

696
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,380
off backups

697
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,360
just tested this recently if you turn

698
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,340
off backups

699
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,919
that data gets removed from iCloud

700
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,500
it will not wait for the backup to be

701
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,020
sent to iCloud it won't wait for that

702
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,760
next cycle to happen of your phone

703
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,700
sending data it does it on the spot

704
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,960
immediately

705
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,659
so keep that in mind if somebody has

706
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,159
turned off backups or if somebody has

707
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
deleted their account it's going to

708
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,720
delete all that stuff in WhatsApp right

709
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,179
away you don't have an extra few hour

710
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,020
window of time

711
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
disappearing messages

712
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,460
um these can be set 24 hours seven days

713
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,260
90 days

714
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,659
this is off by default

715
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,520
so by default your messages are kept

716
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,279
forever

717
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,200
you can change it so if I am talking to

718
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,620
Chris on WhatsApp and I decide

719
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,039
I'm only going to set disappearing chats

720
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,679
to or disappearing messages to 24 hours

721
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,039
that sets disappearing for me for 24

722
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,179
hours

723
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,720
and for him for 24 hours within that

724
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,000
chat

725
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,140
it does not apply to previous chats that

726
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,059
we have had so it is not a retroactive

727
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:37,860
setting it is only a setting that

728
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,659
applies from the time that I said it

729
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:41,039
going forward

730
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,659
and this is actually different than

731
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,580
iMessage because where iMessage is

732
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,220
retroactive right WhatsApp is not right

733
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,159
so messages you can't just set it and

734
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,900
think oh this is like iMessage you can't

735
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,640
just set it and think

736
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,679
okay I said it for seven days so

737
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,720
everything older than a week is now

738
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,760
going to be Auto deleted

739
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,159
sorry doesn't work that way

740
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,580
again this is all also tracked in the

741
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,500
giant P list so if you want those

742
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,340
settings go there

743
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,900
all right so child storage sqlite

744
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,720
database this is where most of the

745
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,220
messaging information is going to be

746
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,600
located

747
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,940
there's four main tables here

748
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,860
um that I wanted to point out

749
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,080
there's data in most everything in there

750
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,240
and it's

751
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,000
there's a lot of joining and messing

752
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,980
with this table so if you really like

753
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,299
sqlite

754
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,279
go have fun with us

755
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,260
um but the four main that I wanted to

756
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,419
point out is the media item tracks all

757
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,179
the attachments so any of the media that

758
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,460
gets sent back and forth

759
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,919
the

760
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,039
zwa message table does dates and

761
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,899
messages there's some other additional

762
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,000
information in there but that's

763
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,799
the main place that you want to go for

764
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,000
that

765
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,299
you can track the profile pictures it

766
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,559
correlates the WhatsApp ID number to the

767
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,299
person's profile picture that they have

768
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,679
set

769
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,179
and then the profile push name

770
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,539
correlates their WhatsApp ID number with

771
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:14,399
however you have their contact name set

772
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,380
so there's an option for there so you

773
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,440
can kind of match this back up

774
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,299
timestamps

775
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,460
timestamps are gross

776
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,120
um

777
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,399
it's I there

778
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,820
I I hate timestamps

779
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,539
um

780
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,080
Mac absolute cocoa Cordata whatever you

781
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,840
want to call it it is

782
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,200
iOS junk

783
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,399
um

784
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:44,100
some of it sort of in nanoseconds some

785
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,980
of it is not stored in nanoseconds it

786
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,960
depends on the table you open in

787
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,760
WhatsApp I've never read those words

788
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,659
before yeah it's it's

789
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:58,940
a lot of fun let me just tell you

790
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,440
stickers and media

791
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,100
um

792
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,380
again these are in the media item table

793
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,980
within that chat storage sqlite database

794
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,880
so these stickers that have been used in

795
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,080
a chat

796
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,500
so I'm sending sticker or I'm sending a

797
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,480
picture or

798
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,299
a gif it's a gift because you cannot

799
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,779
send peanut butter in WhatsApp so keep

800
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,399
that in mind

801
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,640
I send that stuff to Chris

802
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,220
the ones that I have sent

803
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,799
are tracked in the chat storage sqlite

804
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,140
database

805
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,200
the entire list of stickers that I have

806
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,700
available

807
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
to choose from

808
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,480
or in a completely separate database

809
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,000
called stickers.sqlite

810
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,740
so when you're doing the analysis don't

811
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,380
get confused and think oh everything in

812
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,320
this stickers.sqlite is something that

813
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,419
has been sent to somebody else that's

814
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,980
not true

815
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,720
it's only the ones that are in the chat

816
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,840
storage sqlite that have been sent to

817
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,379
somebody else

818
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,200
deleted messages are a lot of fun

819
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
there are multiple ways you can delete

820
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,039
messages in WhatsApp

821
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:17,039
deleting for a user pretty standard I

822
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,480
mean it deletes a message on your own

823
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,559
device

824
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,039
won't delete a message on his device

825
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:23,820
um

826
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,880
just disappears from the chat interface

827
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,399
it also

828
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,580
will delete the row from the database

829
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,159
so you'll have gaps in your databases if

830
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,559
stuff's been deleted

831
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,480
delete for everyone is kind of a fun one

832
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,140
these

833
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,600
can only happen if the message has been

834
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,980
sent

835
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,279
within one hour

836
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,380
after that it's

837
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,140
technically like an hour and like seven

838
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,980
minutes or some stupid obscure time

839
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,899
it's approximately an hour

840
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,039
so

841
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,559
um when that expires you no longer have

842
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,899
the option to delete a message for

843
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:07,980
everybody

844
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,380
so if I'm in a group message and I've

845
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,640
got like three or four different people

846
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,919
in that group message and I send

847
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,559
something out to somebody and I go

848
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,799
there's a typo in there and I

849
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,240
really

850
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,980
want to fix that so I'm going to delete

851
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,360
it for everybody

852
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,220
I can do that and it deletes it from

853
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,779
everybody's device

854
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,480
as long as

855
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,059
everyone has the most recent version of

856
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,600
the application

857
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,500
and

858
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,260
if say somebody hasn't updated their

859
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,299
phone yet

860
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,919
and they're still running an older

861
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,299
version because they want to use it for

862
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,120
testing and they're whatever not that

863
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,519
that's ever happened before

864
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,039
um if I send that delete for everyone

865
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,059
it's not going to delete from his device

866
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,760
but it's not going to tell me that

867
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm gonna still think that it's been

868
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,720
deleted from everybody and I'm going to

869
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,360
be none the wiser in his device over

870
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,540
here is still keeping everything

871
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,239
so keep that in mind

872
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,418
um when you do so if I am sending

873
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,280
a message and I do the delete for

874
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,839
everyone

875
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,780
in my table it's going to replace that

876
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,320
content the body of that message with

877
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,119
you deleted this message

878
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,739
or if he does the delete for everyone

879
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,020
it's going to say Christopher Vance

880
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,300
deleted this message and that's going to

881
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,699
be replacing the body of the message in

882
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,239
that database

883
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,839
group chats

884
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,699
um

885
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,500
pretty self-explanatory you can have a

886
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,659
group of people in a chat

887
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,599
uh these do get tracked separately in

888
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,940
the database

889
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:57,660
um there is a group ID at g dot us

890
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,119
looking at data from other countries it

891
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,760
doesn't appear that that g dot us

892
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,780
changes to like g dot UK for somebody in

893
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,400
the UK

894
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,500
um that states g dot us so just look for

895
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,720
g dot

896
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,280
um for that that'll be everything

897
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,800
associated with a group if it's just an

898
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,599
individual chat in there it's going to

899
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,980
be S your ID which is your phone number

900
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,760
um

901
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,060
at s dot whatsapp.net so there's a way

902
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,980
that you can kind of visually quickly

903
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,940
tell

904
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,619
what's an individual message what's a

905
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,980
group message

906
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,839
status updates again these are the ones

907
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,660
that expire after 24 hours

908
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,400
um they're like Instagram stories it's

909
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,980
just some quick thing that you can throw

910
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,720
up there so those all get tracked

911
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,420
locked contacts

912
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,180
they are now this has changed so they

913
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,599
are now being stored in that same

914
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,099
equality database that we've been

915
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,180
talking about

916
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,660
Under The Blacklist item table

917
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,280
it's going to have the

918
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,020
ID phone number at

919
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,160
s.whatsapp.net for the individuals who

920
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,079
are being blocked

921
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,079
um does not for safety reasons does not

922
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,560
send a block notice to the person being

923
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,800
blocked so if he

924
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,460
keeps sending me iMessages and ignoring

925
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,619
the focus that I have set on it while

926
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,720
I'm in a meeting

927
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,460
um and then I just decide to block him

928
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,380
on all things so he just stops bothering

929
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,099
me

930
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:36,660
um he's not going to get noticed it'll

931
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,760
still look like messages are being sent

932
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,500
out so he can send a whole bunch of

933
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,180
messages it just looks like it's being

934
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,099
unread

935
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,099
um it never gets delivered and for my

936
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,020
device on both of those functions it's

937
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,800
still going to show delivered yes

938
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,079
um older versions of this

939
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,960
will have the blocked contacts stored in

940
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,480
blocked contacts.dat

941
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,440
so if somebody has done I have an iPhone

942
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,720
I get a new iPhone

943
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,040
a couple years later I get another

944
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,980
iPhone

945
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,780
as I'm doing that restore I may have

946
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,540
restored from an old version of WhatsApp

947
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,220
from

948
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,960
five six years ago

949
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,820
and that data might still be on my

950
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,560
device so that you might have two

951
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,480
different locations here you might have

952
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,540
a blocked contacts.that file and you

953
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,760
might also have items in The Blacklist

954
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,380
item table

955
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,700
so look for both of those

956
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,619
bonus got a couple slides here uh and

957
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,920
then we're wrapping up so bonus content

958
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,500
additional things to look at the backed

959
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,260
up key value.sql Lite

960
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,940
this needs

961
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,520
some more research done on it but what I

962
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,920
think it's doing is

963
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,280
it has the cryptographical keys in there

964
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,900
um data required for

965
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,380
identification what I think this is is

966
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,339
the additional password that is set that

967
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,260
a user sets on the backup before it gets

968
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,700
sent to iCloud

969
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,980
and that gets stored there so that if

970
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,500
that gets restored knows how to

971
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,079
decrypt it

972
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,599
um contacts.sqlite

973
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:22,680
this is not the same

974
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,240
address book

975
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,020
contacts table contacts database for iOS

976
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,000
this is a completely separate database

977
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,980
these are the contacts that you have

978
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,300
chosen to allow WhatsApp to view and

979
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,160
have access to so that you can

980
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,380
communicate with those people

981
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,900
consumer version It's the version of

982
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,280
WhatsApp

983
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,760
bonus content you can if you want to be

984
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,240
fancy uh you can set each chat to have

985
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,940
its own wallpaper background just for

986
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,160
fun track sets

987
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,700
uh the pw.dat file contains an encrypted

988
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,780
password

989
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:04,500
what I think this is is the

990
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,220
uh two-factor verification pin that pops

991
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,040
up on WhatsApp every

992
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,440
feels like every five minutes every time

993
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,020
I open WhatsApp that stupid thing comes

994
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,920
up

995
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,540
um I think that's what that is

996
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,720
and then logs if you need logs of

997
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,460
somebody saying like my app's not

998
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,500
working I wasn't able to use WhatsApp

999
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,300
during this time something happened

1000
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,740
whatever

1001
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,260
you have access to the logs to verify

1002
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,480
that information

1003
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,660
so you can find us on Twitter

1004
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,440
um see Scott Vance or forensics woman

1005
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,760

00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,579
contain all this information cheat
