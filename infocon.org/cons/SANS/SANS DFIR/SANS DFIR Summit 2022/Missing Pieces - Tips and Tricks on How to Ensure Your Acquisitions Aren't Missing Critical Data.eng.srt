1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,920
you to our talk missing pieces tips and

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,300
tricks on how to ensure your

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,040
Acquisitions aren't missing critical

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,920
data I'm Cesar kezata and this is

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,100
Jessica Hyde

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,720
[Music]

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,220
first starters and

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,720
and he has got

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,400
geises that otherwise wouldn't have been

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
gotten into and found data that was

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,900
missing regularly so so excited to

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,520
partner with him on this talk he's

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,059
currently in three roles he does r d for

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,300
arcpoint he does he's a senior technical

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,460
exploitation officer at mantec working

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,680
in a lab he's been working in for a very

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,500
long time killing it there doing really

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,480
great work and he's a commander of an

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,360
Army National Guard unit uh in the 133rd

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,640
cyber security groups though true expert

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,379
here uh we worked together when we were

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,899
both with the basis uh and he's worked a

24
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,480
wonderful amount of other places George

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Mason a graduate of their Ms and

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,519
computer forensics program and a cool

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,439
reviewer for dfr review if anybody wants

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,180
to help out with that project and peer

29
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,560
review for the community we'd love it

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
yes

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
and this is Jessica I'm sure most of you

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,640
if not all of you know who Jessica is

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,740
right she's everywhere

34
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,080
um she's founder and owner of hexordia

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,759
she's also an Adjunct professor at

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,619
George Mason University so she's helping

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,100
grow the future uh fire indicators out

38
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,560
there and helping grow the field he's

39
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,500
been at Magnet at basis at Ernst Young

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,380
American systems and like I said she's

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,720
everywhere she's even on Tick Tock now

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,240
so I'd recommend you go follow her

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,420
foreign

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,659
all right here's today's agenda do you

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,640
want to touch on you know why do we care

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,619
why should you care about this talk and

47
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,479
then we're going to go into some real

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,759
world examples of how data could be

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,619
missing from hard drives and mobile

50
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,020
devices we're going to touch briefly on

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,420
how to test it to determine if you're

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,699
missing data and then we'll wrap it up

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,919
with some questions

54
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,620
so why do we care we care because if

55
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,420
your collection is missing some of the

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,459
critical elements of data you're not

57
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:19,500
going to be able to find all of the cool

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,780
artifacts that were being discussed like

59
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,360
in Heather and Jared's talk earlier

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
today a lot of those artifacts can be

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,819
missing if you don't have a fully

62
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,879
inclusive acquisition and a lot of times

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,819
we are unaware that our Acquisitions

64
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,680
aren't complete and so today we're going

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,940
to bring you some tips and tricks to

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,560
take care of that

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
so we could say we don't know what you

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,239
don't know right we can often say that

69
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,580
something exists right if you have a

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,560
picture you have the picture you have

71
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,200
the metadata you know it exists but you

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,120
really can't say that you know perhaps

73
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,739
it doesn't exist in other places it

74
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,900
wasn't sent somewhere if you don't have

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,200
that data to look at right so that's why

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,660
it's important to keep an eye out and

77
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,940
always do proper investigations and when

78
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,920
you don't have that complete picture you

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,379
can wind up making incorrect assumptions

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:17,159
it's also important as we recognize that

81
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,879
there are times where a triage or a very

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,760
specific targeted acquisition is

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,560
necessary so when we're talking about

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,580
these times when we're talking about

85
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,180
missing data we're talking about

86
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,200
unintentional data that you're not

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,819
acquiring not when you're doing an

88
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,040
intentionally targeted acquisition there

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
are definitely times when you don't want

90
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,819
to wait to get the whole physical if

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,959
you're doing an Enterprise collection

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,519
you're not going to collect every single

93
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,200
computer or full disk image and look at

94
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,420
them all uh to figure out what's going

95
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,459
on there's definitely a need for it

96
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,920
however when you are working a case

97
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,560
where you need to be able to provide to

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
the other side data of possibly somebody

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,980
being exonerated if you don't have the

100
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,840
full picture you may be missing

101
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
exonerable evidence and I think that's

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,540
really critical in investigations

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,459
when we're talking about scope you know

104
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,680
oftentimes we are limited on what we can

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,959
look at if you are doing an

106
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,819
investigation you can look at from time

107
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,978
a to time b

108
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,560
um that that's your limitation okay so

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,320
we accept that but if you go and acquire

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
that device from time a to time B and

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,400
that's all the data you get

112
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,139
you're going to be missing data when you

113
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,520
go back to your lab and perhaps you're

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
doing that further investigation and you

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,380
need to put pieces together that are

116
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,960
outside that scope so we often say to

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
limit your collection on the analysis

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,820
side right get as much data as you can

119
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,300
and then limit yourself on the outside

120
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,000
analysis aside from time a to time B and

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,780
then

122
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,000
once you're doing your investigation you

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,620
still have the additional data to go

124
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,060
after I'm going to tell you why this

125
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,220
really scares me because a lot of times

126
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,080
there's tools out

127
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,360
and limit your scope

128
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,220
in terms of meeting data within a pair

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,139
of time frames but if we go back to that

130
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:05,940
you don't know what you don't know if

131
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,740
you're limiting in time frames there's a

132
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,360
possibility that you're not getting the

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,340
data the third party applications that

134
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,080
are not supported about your tools that

135
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,699
they don't know to collect if you're

136
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,500
able to collect that data and then limit

137
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
on analysis you're going to be much

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,520
better off but even more importantly in

139
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,979
some instances there are databases that

140
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,780
correlate to other databases that'll be

141
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,539
with outside of your time date range

142
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,759
maybe a contacts database that's older

143
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,139
for an application that needs to be

144
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,900
correlated with the messages database

145
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,180
so now let's look into some examples of

146
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,000
computers and hard drives and some data

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,400
that we could be missing

148
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,220
so let's take for example the Samsung T

149
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,259
drives right I'm sure everyone's used

150
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,720
them every they're everywhere right the

151
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
little Samsung T drives

152
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
um nowadays they're coming out with

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,080
newer technology now they have a

154
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,940
fingerprint reader on there that can

155
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,620
lock the drive to encrypt it and you

156
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,720
know some claims are that it doesn't

157
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,120
work on Linux even in Samsung's own

158
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
documentation but here you can see the

159
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,340
where it says it's only supported on

160
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,679
Windows and Mac OS right so

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
um once you bring that drive into Linux

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,620
it's not a problem during our testing

163
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,139
because we found that even though

164
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:23,759
Samsung's own documentation says it

165
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,620
doesn't work on Linux

166
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,860
um it does it does right right so if

167
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,600
you're working on a Linux workstation

168
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,960
and perhaps it's not working for you you

169
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,860
know

170
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,020
it doesn't work

171
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,440
um so here's a view of that uh drive

172
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,479
when it's locked

173
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,539
and now unlocked right sorry I I went

174
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,120
too fast for you sorry a lot right it's

175
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,100
a bunch of unallocated space and it's

176
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,840
not going to give you any data however

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
when you apply your fingerprint

178
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,000
is unlocked and all the partitions

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,880
appear there's not a problem

180
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,039
here's another view of the Samsung Drive

181
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,319
locked

182
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,419
and now it's unlocked you can see it it

183
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,539
has a FS events at some point this this

184
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,280
particular Drive was connected to a Mac

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,139
but

186
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,960
and here ftk imager again locked

187
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,880
and it's important because if you're not

188
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
aware of new technologies coming out you

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
could be plugging this drive into your

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,520
computer you could see that it's much of

191
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,960
an unallocated space you might think

192
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,819
there's nothing on here or something's

193
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,500
wrong with the drive when in fact it's

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,720
just you need a fingerprint or some

195
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,460
other security measure needs to be

196
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,960
unlocked for you to take a look at it

197
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,940
and something key here is that even in

198
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,060
the lock there appears to be data so you

199
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,680
could be misguided and think that it was

200
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
just a less used dry drive if it's

201
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
unlocked I want to get into something

202
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,380
that's going to be mismatched of

203
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,699
compatibility of things where you make

204
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:52,620
it missing Acquisitions so how many

205
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,840
people out here have really upped their

206
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,080
speed and are using USB 3.2 gen 2x2s

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,660
getting that 20 gpps all right I see a

208
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,120
couple hands fast adopters of Technology

209
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,380
right

210
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,479
so if you run into one of these in a

211
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,039
while these are going to give you 20

212
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,919
gpbs 20 Gigabytes per second versus the

213
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,300
10 gigabytes per second you're going to

214
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,699
get with regular USB 3.2 which is really

215
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,880
confusing because USB 3.0 was renamed

216
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,440
anywhere so many times so many times

217
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,419
3031 oh now we're three two and we don't

218
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,440
care if you're backwards because it's

219
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,660
three two gen two anyway

220
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,479
if you have in evidence a 3.2 drive it

221
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,479
is backwards compatible 3.2 gen 2x2 it

222
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,039
is backwards compatible and you'll be

223
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,779
able to image completely and normally

224
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,740
with a USB 3.2 Gen 2

225
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,240
receiver however

226
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,260
however if you are those fancy labs and

227
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,260
you are like woohoo I got the speed

228
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,480
and you really only get that speed when

229
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,399
you're matched guess what happens when

230
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,440
you're matched with this new technology

231
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
it drops bits without your knowledge

232
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,380
you're not going to get consistent

233
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,779
hashing Imaging the same drive over and

234
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,000
over and you're actually going to need

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,060
to plug that in instead to your 10 gbps

236
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,519
port to do your collections or you can

237
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,860
be losing data and that's really crazy

238
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,540
and scary and I don't think people are

239
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,860
aware sometimes when they adapt

240
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,540
technology and go oh I'm getting the

241
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,640
fastest they don't realize that that

242
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,899
speed is dropping bits

243
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,880
right and here's another example uh

244
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,320
where we have

245
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,880
um the same hard drive so that's the

246
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,320
same hard drive in both those pictures

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,959
right we have a star tech adapter that

248
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,459
you can buy anywhere it's just an

249
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,620
adapter to read the hard drive and on

250
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,060
the right side you have the hard drive

251
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,279
in its enclosure that it came in we just

252
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,740
took the case off uh for the purposes of

253
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,040
the picture

254
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
so we image the drive

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,920
first with the start Tech adapter this

256
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,140
is the hash that ftk provided us for the

257
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,019
Imaging of the entire Drive

258
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,480
and then we plugged it into with its

259
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
adapter uh hard drive enclosure adapter

260
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
that it came with and it gives us a

261
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
completely different hash

262
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,420
so that is clearly not something's wrong

263
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,760
here so here it is in Linux uh we're

264
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,140
looking at the different partitions here

265
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,959
uh with the star tech adapter not a

266
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:10,800
problem

267
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
however with its original hard drive

268
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,940
enclosure we have a warning that the

269
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,839
backup GPT cable is corrupt and there's

270
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,120
one less sector in this acquisition so

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,860
you're actually missing a sector by

272
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,260
using the native adapter instead of

273
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,600
putting on an acquisition adapter

274
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,959
right and so here's the look in ftk

275
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,959
imager the last sector is in red this is

276
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,480
the start Tech adapter

277
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,180
and here it is with its native Drive

278
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,300
native adapter that is the end of disk

279
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,300
of the uh adapter right there there is

280
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,720
no additional sector so that adapter is

281
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,600
cutting it off logically

282
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,579
um and it's discarding that last last

283
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,500
sector for itself where it's metadata

284
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,240
and what have you so that's just

285
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,980
something to be aware of whenever you're

286
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,980
Imaging in a drive with its own adapter

287
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,720
in it okay this is the one that scares

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,260
me so in 2017 on the stage Courtney Webb

289
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,120
came and did a fantastic talk that I

290
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,220
encourage you all to watch

291
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,600
um called implications of firmware

292
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,300
trickery and hard drives and the tldr on

293
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,860
that is that a drive can come labeled as

294
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,200
a one terabyte drive but beyond a two

295
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,779
terabyte disk this is to save money and

296
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,300
there are utilities out there that will

297
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,019
allow you to go ahead and store in that

298
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,480
additional space but then when you plug

299
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,100
in the drive for Recovery it'll still

300
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,140
look like that original one terabyte

301
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,560
drive there's also tools like HDD hacker

302
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
that allow you to alter the drives at

303
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
the firmware so most acquisition

304
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,820
Hardware utilities a lot of them will

305
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,079
not catch this and get the second

306
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,880
utilities but there are some that will

307
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,200
go ahead

308
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,760
um and look at the firmware and allow

309
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
you to think it so basically you can be

310
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,120
fooled into thinking that the drive is a

311
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,500
different size or people it's two

312
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,579
different scenarios you can take a drive

313
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,500
that's a known size and alter it or you

314
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,720
can take a drive that the manufacturer

315
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,579
has shortened because they're using the

316
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,180
same physical disk uh to share but

317
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,820
they're changing the sizes

318
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,100
so in an example of

319
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,680
a device perhaps that's new technology

320
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,720
right we'll we'll look at the Microsoft

321
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,860
Surface

322
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,140
we get a piece of evidence a new

323
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,760
technology back in you know a few years

324
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,560
ago when Microsoft Surface first came

325
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,339
out

326
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,680
you couldn't know how to image it we had

327
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,420
no idea how to image this device it was

328
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,940
brand new we had one USB port

329
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,720
um

330
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,820
you know it was a problem but thanks to

331
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,940
the community and this is a very

332
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,920
sharing Community with all the parcels

333
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,440
and tips in methodology

334
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,540
um someone out there posted a

335
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,459
walkthrough of how to image this device

336
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,839
so now

337
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,180
we pretty much use this walkthrough

338
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,880
um today right we needed a powered USB

339
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,639
hub changing some settings in in the

340
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,339
security settings like

341
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,480
um external drive keyboard and mouse so

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,360
relying on other examiners who are more

343
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,560
knowledgeable and who have you know been

344
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,260
around the block a bit more is is very

345
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,899
helpful for acquiring new devices that

346
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,700
perhaps maybe you wouldn't be able to

347
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,220
get if you were working by yourself

348
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,260
not all of these methods are going to

349
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,459
work like you think they're going to

350
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:23,040
work so I've had the luxury of spending

351
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,420
a lot of time digging into Chromebooks

352
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,220
over the last several years and Daniel

353
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,019
dickerman came out with this incredible

354
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,540
method of acquiring Chromebooks that's

355
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,579
based on a custom recovery it's great

356
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,100
peer-reviewed work I've used this method

357
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,760
multiple times fantastic except

358
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,800
when you're doing this method the

359
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,639
Chromebook writes out the data to what's

360
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,180
left on the drive before writing it out

361
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,680
to your external media that you're

362
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,339
copying to so if let's say you have a 64

363
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,279
gig hard drive okay on on your

364
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,839
Chromebook and by the way if you think

365
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,399
all the Chromebook data is in the cloud

366
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,160
it's not pldr I've got lots of stuff on

367
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,320
that so you're acquiring the Chrome back

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
you get the 64. you've got 64 gigs 50 of

369
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,899
it is used that means you've got 14 gigs

370
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,459
your acquisition is only going to be 14

371
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,200
gigs and your tools are not going to

372
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,000
notify you so if you're not logging in

373
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,399
and checking that disk size you're going

374
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,060
to be short data in the opposite if you

375
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,920
only had 14 gigs of use it's going to

376
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,600
write you out that 14 gig image you're

377
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,160
going to have everything and there is

378
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
your tools your methodology you're not

379
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,459
going to get a warning that you're not

380
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,079
getting all the data and that's really

381
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,060
the key to what we're talking about

382
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,040
all right so now let's take a look at

383
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,200
mobile devices something we all love and

384
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,240
hate right we love them because they

385
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,339
give us a lot of information but

386
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,380
we hate them because it's information

387
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,300
overload and sometimes they're hard to

388
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,260
get

389
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,000
so when we're talking about mobile

390
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
devices we're going to talk about the

391
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,040
difference between the different

392
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,899
Acquisitions and the problem is is the

393
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,160
terminology is a little different than

394
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,480
you may see in typical computer

395
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,760
forensics so I'm going to share

396
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,139
um the terminology that I personally

397
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,060
know and teach because I think it's

398
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,800
the most applicable to understanding

399
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,420
these differences so that we can talk

400
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,740
about then the differences between the

401
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,760
data you're going to get in these

402
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,139
Acquisitions and when you need to get

403
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,360
them so for mobile images you've got the

404
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,120
physical The Logical and the file system

405
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,940
and physical and logical and file system

406
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,860
do not mean the same thing here as they

407
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,019
do in traditional dead box computer

408
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,720
forensics so the definition we're going

409
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,160
to use here is that if physical means

410
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,839
that the data is pulled directly from a

411
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,180
connection to the devices storage area

412
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,639
it is reading the data from the storage

413
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,880
area directly a logical mobile forensic

414
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,399
image means we're pulling the data via

415
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,560
the operating system and that's data as

416
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,959
interpreted by the operating system this

417
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,300
is also controlled by what the operating

418
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,980
system is trying to let you get back

419
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,560
included in this area would also be if

420
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,779
you're doing iTunes backups if you're

421
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:49,920
doing any kind of backup if you're

422
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,720
putting an agent on a device anytime

423
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,300
you're communicating via Android or iOS

424
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,459
to get the data you're getting that data

425
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:58,380
as interpreted by the operating system

426
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,019
there's several methodologies here be it

427
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,160
on an old school at command to uh you

428
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,959
know doing APK downgrades there's a lot

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,220
of different ways to collect data

430
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,620
logically but that logical data in this

431
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,440
terminology is going to be has collected

432
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,899
by the operating system very different

433
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,339
than the term logical in computer

434
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:18,899
forensics which is actually more

435
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,540
synonymous with the term file system

436
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,779
image in Mobile forensics the file

437
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,220
system image is going to be the

438
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,139
collection of all the active files and

439
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,920
folders that exist on the drive now if

440
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,360
you're used to the computer forensics

441
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
world and not really to mobile you may

442
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,019
be thinking well that's going to mislead

443
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,779
it not really because on mobile phones a

444
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,339
lot of our data is happening in

445
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,100
databases uh and those records still

446
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,620
exist within the file so there's going

447
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,079
to be lots of remnants of data and

448
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,180
non-user data as well you can get that

449
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,639
complete picture so for us really today

450
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,220
the full file system image is really the

451
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,839
gold standard because we don't get a lot

452
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,459
of physicals anymore because of

453
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,600
encryption

454
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,000
or they're useless

455
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,919
yes

456
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,500
so an example that Jessica and I always

457
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
like to talk about is we had a case once

458
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,660
where we had an Android phone and this

459
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,000
was a very hot case and talking they

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,339
wanted the data yesterday right it was

461
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,919
in the news hot so uh we took a look at

462
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,020
it we took a look at our tool the tool

463
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,240
said yes we can get you a full physical

464
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,480
of that device no problem you know so we

465
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,000
plug it up we start the acquisition and

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,380
in the meantime we're going through all

467
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,480
the typical websites you go to for

468
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,580
mobile devices like GSM Arena or Phone

469
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,520
Scoop to look up the specs and to verify

470
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,740
you know what we have exactly going on

471
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,580
here

472
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,760
uh the websites tell us we have about 16

473
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,320
gigabytes of data that we should be

474
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,380
expecting for a

475
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,700
image of this device

476
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,400
and then our tool finishes and it says

477
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,100
great we got all the data all one gigs

478
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,980
one gigabyte of data so there's a little

479
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,080
bit of a discrepancy there between the

480
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,500
16 gigs and the uh one gigabyte of data

481
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,020
so uh in the end we ended up having to

482
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,780
terminal use a Mac and terminal into

483
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,720
that phone to DD the 16 gigabytes of

484
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,760
emmc that were on there

485
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
and plus the one gig that the tool gave

486
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,860
us which was an additional we actually

487
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,960
ended up with 17 gigabytes of data

488
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,840
versus that even the 16 gigabytes that

489
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,299
the websites told us so it's just

490
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:29,100
something to be aware of that you

491
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,140
shouldn't always trust the tool even

492
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,480
though it tells you you know I can get

493
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,620
all of it

494
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,980
sure it got all of it but we're still

495
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,080
missing yeah I'm missing a whole nother

496
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,520
storage area and and here's the deal

497
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,500
right if the if you're noticing a

498
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,780
pattern it's we got the data but then we

499
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,460
realized we were missing some and we

500
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,140
looked and we researched and found out

501
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,820
there's actually more data to get there

502
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,980
how do we now get this right and and we

503
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,620
were actually able to just see that uh

504
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,700
emmc uh via the terminal and just DD it

505
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,919
was actually relatively simple once we

506
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,919
figured out that that data was there uh

507
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,600
I want to see it really quickly before

508
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,520
we oh this before we dig into this yeah

509
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,580
yeah there's there's there is value to

510
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,860
doing a triage extraction there is value

511
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,200
to doing a quick logical and not getting

512
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,880
all the data at first because it's easy

513
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
to manage you can look at it you can

514
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,260
inform your

515
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,700
interviews I always try to pause myself

516
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,720
and stop myself from saying

517
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,940
interrogation

518
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,500
difference in the world is that you work

519
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,960
in different times in your life uh so

520
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,100
you know that information can inform

521
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,720
but when we get to Android let's talk

522
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,400
about how the differences are between

523
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
these so we're going to talk about all

524
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,460
the differences between different

525
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,780
artifacts and what you're going to get

526
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,460
in that logical versus that full file

527
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,840
system

528
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,360
oh my gosh my data is not showing up on

529
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,740
the screen

530
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,960
oh that's bad okay so let's see what

531
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,240
Jessica can do from memory because my

532
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
slides which looked fine yesterday are

533
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
actually missing the blocks below that

534
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
are going to tell you what's going on so

535
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,500
luckily hopefully I know what the heck

536
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,840
I'm talking about so

537
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,600
so when we're talking about uh Goods so

538
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,140
your MSI sen your imeis those are all

539
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,760
going to be present in both your logical

540
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,039
and full file system extractions as well

541
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,900
as your Pim data except for call logs

542
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,419
and notes uh all of your call logs are

543
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:19,919
going to be impressed in both your SMS

544
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,059
messages are going to be good you're

545
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,100
going to be good on m s messages where

546
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,360
you're going to start to see a

547
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,100
difference as your Standalone files

548
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,320
you're going to get partial recovery in

549
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
your logical versus your full file

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
system images when we talk about

551
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,980
application data you are going to have

552
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,280
wide discrepancies this is because some

553
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,220
applications are going to share that

554
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,200
information and backups and others will

555
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,299
not and even when you have that shared

556
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,100
data and backups it's a difference

557
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,380
between if they're exporting the entire

558
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,600
full file system or not very similar to

559
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,919
what we're going to see in social media

560
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,260
so in social media application data

561
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,760
these are both areas where you're really

562
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,980
going to need the full file system if

563
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,020
you want data from your additional apps

564
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,600
so for example WhatsApp data does appear

565
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,799
in backups but you won't get signal data

566
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,880
for example

567
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,100
communication app data kind of what I

568
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,120
was just talking about that's going to

569
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,559
differ internet data is going to differ

570
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,440
and this is really interesting because

571
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,940
you may think that you're going to get

572
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,440
all of your browser history and a

573
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,760
logical you won't there's going to be

574
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,500
much more enriched in a full file system

575
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,720
on Android you need a full file system

576
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,660
for email OS and app activity if you

577
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,120
want the really cool stuff like usage

578
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,059
stacks and recent paths usage Stacks is

579
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,559
going to show up in full file system

580
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,900
recent tasks is going to be partial and

581
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,900
logical deleted files if you really want

582
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,340
to pull those archives like I said those

583
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,799
are going to be at in those files that

584
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,000
you're going to recover and you're going

585
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,740
to scrape through so you're not going to

586
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,120
see that data in your logical you need

587
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,039
your full file system

588
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,260
so we're going to move into iOS now

589
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,059
right so

590
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:54,600
um

591
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,179
so with iOS we have a couple additional

592
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,159
calls to look at so we're going to look

593
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,200
at still The Logical and the file system

594
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,419
but now we're going to look at AFU and

595
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,400
vfu which is after person lock and

596
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,799
before first unlock and just real quick

597
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,620
overview after first unlock is when the

598
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,740
phone has been rebooted and uh the the

599
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,600
passcode has been entered at least one

600
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,539
time and before first unlock is after

601
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,400
the phone's been rebooted and it has not

602
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,460
been unlocked and depending on those

603
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,220
dates is how much data you'll get now

604
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,559
this I'm going to admit my memory is not

605
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,179
going to be as clear as what's between

606
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,600
BSU logical AFU and ffs uh without it on

607
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,340
my slides so this will be fun equipment

608
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,280
user data you do get them all uh Pim

609
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,840
data

610
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,600
I know you get both an AFU and full file

611
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,740
system

612
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,980
uh so I believe that you get notified

613
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,140
some of your notifications in bfu but

614
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,080
you don't get full it's a partial uh

615
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,720
call odds you're good off your partial

616
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,720
and bfu SMS your logical yeah AFU and

617
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,820
your full file system will be complete I

618
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,919
am going to have a link at the end of

619
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,080
this slide deck there's a QR code and

620
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,640
you'll be able to see these tables

621
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,960
incomplete uh not incomplete completely

622
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,820
I speak so quickly there was no space

623
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,799
between the word in and complete you

624
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,960
will completely see all of these tables

625
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,840
populated uh in that uh PDF that's

626
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,460
available there so you'll be able to see

627
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,620
the difference between MMS where each

628
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,539
one of these files are for each of these

629
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:28,799
categories the tobr on each of these uh

630
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,360
with there there are some interesting

631
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,280
ones uh so like when we talk about

632
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,919
communication app data

633
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,059
um

634
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,700
my gosh a Snapchat for example you can

635
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,520
get some of the data in bfu and not in

636
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,380
logical but you'll get it in AFU and

637
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,600
full file system so between dfu and

638
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,179
logical what you get is going to vary

639
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:50,820
um the tlvr on this is your strongest

640
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,919
extraction is going to be your full file

641
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,679
system every single time but you can get

642
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,919
so much data from ASU and

643
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:00,360
proceeds are just went through the

644
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,299
difference between bfu and AFU and what

645
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,280
that really means at the end of the day

646
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,419
is that you cannot have that device die

647
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,640
so sometimes folks will be like oh I

648
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,200
recovered the data I recovered the phone

649
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,820
sees it from the scene I put it in a

650
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,159
Saturday bag I've isolated from the

651
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,260
network no one can send a white command

652
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,400
yes

653
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,820
but they didn't put it on a charger

654
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,559
and if you don't put it on a charger and

655
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,360
that phone sits in a faraday bag that

656
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,100
battery is going to drain and once that

657
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,140
battery drains and that device is now in

658
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,080
that bfu mode even if it's locked a lot

659
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,299
of your forensics tools or at least two

660
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:38,220
of them will be able to get you an

661
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,500
extraction even though the device is

662
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,100
locked that extraction if it is before

663
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,320
the device reboots so you keep the power

664
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
on it it was unlocked by the user before

665
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,520
you seize it and had not had a power up

666
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,520
you are going to get great data

667
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,520
even without cracking up password so

668
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,080
before you even brute force it so you

669
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,419
can start looking at that data but

670
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,059
if you let that battery drain out

671
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,380
you're gonna get next to nothing and and

672
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,760
that's what's on all these slides that

673
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,240
aren't there

674
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,960
this is my passion to talk about it

675
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,659
especially uh GPS data the tldr on this

676
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,880
is if you want all of the incredible

677
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,059
artifacts that um Heather maholic and

678
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,380
Jerry Barnhart were just showing in

679
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,200
their last presentation

680
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,120
you need to have that full file system

681
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,580
yeah let's talk about retention

682
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,679
all right so in an example of you know

683
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,020
did the user change a setting we're

684
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,419
gonna take a look at this uh mobile smsp

685
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,419
list which denotes the iOS message

686
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,799
retention

687
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,400
so by default iOS will ship you the

688
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,220
um keep messages for days as forever

689
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,559
that's how it comes to you as without

690
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,600
the user ever changing them

691
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,940
so we wanted to see if we could

692
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,039
determine if the user ever changed it so

693
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,440
we image of the device and the keep

694
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,600
messages for days keys in that P list

695
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,419
was nowhere to be found it doesn't exist

696
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:07,200
there

697
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,720
so we change the option to one year and

698
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,919
then all of a sudden that keep messages

699
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,860
for days key appears with the value of

700
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,840
365 obviously for 365 days in a year

701
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,360
we image did again change the option to

702
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,260
30 and now it has a value of 30. and

703
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
finally we changed it back to Forever

704
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,419
and now the keep messages for days key

705
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,000
appears it's still there but now it has

706
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
a value of zero so now we know that the

707
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,580
user did change it at some point we just

708
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,380
don't know any additional data after

709
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,179
that well this is important because now

710
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,919
you know that your collection there's

711
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,779
data that doesn't contain and you need

712
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,520
to find other ways to validate the data

713
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,900
the problem is you don't know what

714
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,120
period that was on or off for

715
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,299
so here's the big issue You've Got That

716
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,100
device and you kept the charger on it

717
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,120
you kept that device AFU yes we're gonna

718
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,760
get all the data so because you've got

719
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,020
that battery on it right you can just

720
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,580
leave it on the Shelf

721
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,840
no

722
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,880
these databases the rich database

723
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,320
sources that you heard about in the last

724
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,880
talk they drop data every single day you

725
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,820
are losing data from a period before

726
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,559
Safari history retains 30 days now can

727
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,299
you carve additional data potentially

728
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,940
from the database yes but the active

729
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,039
records Right Live records versus not

730
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,779
live those are going to be a 30-day

731
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,700
history so every day you go you're going

732
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,500
to drop a day past there is a weird

733
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,299
thing if the same website's been visited

734
00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:36,000
way past before the 30 days and it was

735
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,740
continually visited never dropped out of

736
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,659
30 days it will maintain time stamps

737
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,240
from before so if you see that don't

738
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,279
necessarily think that you didn't lose

739
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,020
that data you did it doesn't mean your

740
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,299
database goes back that to far deleted

741
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,600
photos they're on the device for 30 days

742
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,980
so that the user can put them back up

743
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,000
after that they're going to be gone

744
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,940
knowledge see all the incredible work

745
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,279
that Sarah Edwards has done on the HC

746
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,419
database and shared with the community

747
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,419
that Apollo parses fantastic Rich

748
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,179
artifacts

749
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:08,340
they all kind of range between 7 and 28

750
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,799
days uh depending on how long the shelf

751
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,419
life they have

752
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,900
Cash locations every single day you're

753
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,779
losing Cash locations the call logs are

754
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,520
some variance by carrier but they are

755
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
dropping day by day so tldr and this is

756
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,960
when are you going to acquire that

757
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,580
device

758
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,559
as soon as freaking possible it should

759
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,299
be asfp

760
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,039
sorry

761
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,100
because you need them right so now we're

762
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,419
going to touch on how do we determine

763
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,539
you know if our devices uh if we need to

764
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,960
do additional steps to get devices or

765
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,539
possibly missing uh data

766
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,460
so the first thing and Caesar touched on

767
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,600
this when he was talking about the

768
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,980
surface is you need to listen to the

769
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,620
community there's no way to really know

770
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,059
about the fact that your Chromebook

771
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,960
Acquisitions are going to only go as far

772
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,700
back as the period that you have written

773
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,900
on the disk because the methodology

774
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,760
right said this before it writes out if

775
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,320
you're not following what's going on in

776
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,659
the community and looking things up uh

777
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,520
if you are not on Twitter please get on

778
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,860
Twitter follow hashtag dfir it's the

779
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,240
best way to keep up on what's going on

780
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,159
that's where people share it this week

781
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,320
in forensics is a Blog ran by stillmore

782
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,580
that talks about oh what doesn't talk

783
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,140
about it lists everything that comes out

784
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
from the communities like 200 some odd

785
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,020
things the community puts out each week

786
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,120
I do read it weekly but that's not how I

787
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,159
use it if I'm looking at a device and

788
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,539
something doesn't seem right in my

789
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,179
acquisition I use that as a search query

790
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,220
to find the blogs that people

791
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,080
practitioners other people have put out

792
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,760
for the things they've seen

793
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,399
uh the digital forensic Discord server

794
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,279
has over 10 000 forensicators on there

795
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,740
talking actively about the problems and

796
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,659
solutions they're seeing

797
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,820
search that read it become familiar with

798
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,980
it if you have a specific it's very

799
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,779
broken down into category so you can

800
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:56,460
actually have the conversations where

801
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,460
you are but the big thing is if you

802
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,100
don't see the data you expect if your

803
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,020
driver your collection size of the

804
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,279
lesson you want and it's actually one of

805
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,419
the advantages of not doing a Target

806
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,399
collection is you should be able to

807
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,860
determine what the total size should be

808
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,140
and even if that means yeah you've got

809
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,360
to log into that Chromebook live right

810
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,539
yeah you need to research what size the

811
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,220
manufacturer actually uses for that

812
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,380
drive and if they partition down in the

813
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,820
firmware

814
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,740
so that you can ask those questions when

815
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,779
you see what you don't expect we are

816
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,460
talking about a lot of scenarios I know

817
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,440
we didn't give case examples that's more

818
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,480
due to the cases we work that we can

819
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,880
really discuss them but

820
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,860
these are things that we've ran into

821
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,279
time and time again on actual cases and

822
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,659
the answer is is when something doesn't

823
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,700
look right you need to get that Exemplar

824
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,899
and tests

825
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,460
you don't want to be testing on your

826
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,080
device so I'd say one of the most

827
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
critical things

828
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,320
to being able to discover and get

829
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,679
through this is really ensuring that

830
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,940
your exemplars

831
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,140
have a little flexibility and you think

832
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,960
about what other ways can I look at this

833
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,179
if you are running into a prom because

834
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,620
you're doing a Linux collection and

835
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,080
you're seeing a GPT table that's not

836
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,539
working and is corrupted what other way

837
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,279
can I try to do this collection to see

838
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,559
if I can get that space

839
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:22,200
you need to really think outside and say

840
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,179
well let me try this and do it with an

841
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,340
Exemplar that you've populated you know

842
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,140
what's there

843
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,100
when you populate data document document

844
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,860
document and more importantly if you can

845
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,440
please share those data sets back out

846
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,539
with the community so they can use them

847
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:41,640
as testing and reference test sets thank

848
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,559
you Joshua Hickman for all of the data

849
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,899
sets you've contributed to the community

850
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,120
and then once you're done populating

851
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,640
your device you need to go ahead and

852
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,919
validate your assumptions

853
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,500
one of the biggest problems that I see

854
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,360
with testing for this particular

855
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,740
scenario

856
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,880
is unintentional inserted bias

857
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,240
it is very difficult to sometimes think

858
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,399
like how somebody would misuse the

859
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,320
device

860
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,380
but it's really what you need to do to

861
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,659
see that and then try to misuse the

862
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,480
device to validate your assumptions

863
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,880
so in summary uh just to wrap it all up

864
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,820
Triage images are valuable but they

865
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,320
won't have all the data so try to get

866
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,220
that

867
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,279
you know full file system if you can

868
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,860
once you have the image make sure to

869
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,779
take another look at it make sure it's

870
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,760
not encrypted make sure it opens up in

871
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,380
your forensic tools I mean I think about

872
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,360
all those old blackberries right there

873
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,399
were all these old blackberries that

874
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,440
would you would get a full physical

875
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,059
um tools were good at giving me full

876
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,500
physical the blackberries but there was

877
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,840
nothing out there that would parse them

878
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,600
um so I needed the logical The Logical

879
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,299
was more appropriate for all of those

880
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,340
freaking BlackBerry World devices right

881
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,620
tools may not be self-aware uh that a

882
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,299
collection is incomplete an example of

883
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,700
the Android right the tool thought it

884
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,179
did its job it got the full physical but

885
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:09,919
yeah

886
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,720
that's the one chip right but we were

887
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
missing 16 gigs of data so that that's a

888
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,740
lot for phone

889
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,320
uh an example of surface these

890
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,179
examiner's knowledge is critical right

891
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,279
we didn't know how to image that device

892
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,559
so if we would have just relied on

893
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:27,480
ourselves that piece of evidence would

894
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,039
have sat there for a long time but we

895
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,120
you know we looked in the community

896
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,620
looked exactly you know how can we get

897
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,500
this device Acquired and we're able to

898
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,240
figure that out right at the end of the

899
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,860
day our job is not just to follow

900
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,299
instructions as to how to acquire

901
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:44,039
devices and to look at the data from the

902
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,480
tools our data is our job is to question

903
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,279
what the tools are doing for us and see

904
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,019
what might be missing

905
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,820
that is our role

906
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,620
otherwise we could all be automated out

907
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,500
of our jobs right let's be real our role

908
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,600
is to figure out what else

909
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,240
isn't there what is new what is missing

910
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,279
right right

911
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,339
and the state of the device is uh

912
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,560
important at time acquisition just so

913
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,899
you know what to expect you know AFU bfu

914
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,239
logical physical you need to know that

915
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,859
so you know what to expect when you're

916
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,300
getting that data and if you really want

917
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,099
to know what to expect please pull the

918
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,719
slides where the data actually is

919
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,639
instead of the like 20 blank slides I

920
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,199
had in there of that we promise it's

921
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,418
there

922
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:28,980
and then uh from time to seizure to

923
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,020
acquisition is important right you as

924
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,339
soon as you get that device you want to

925
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,099
try to acquire it immediately even if

926
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,839
you have it in a faraday bag airplane

927
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:40,199
mode even if it's powered on

928
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,480
uh with a battery it's going to lose

929
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,760
data day by day so you want to try to

930
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,460
get an acquisition as soon as possible

931
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,800
okay and with that yeah

932
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,960
um so first off please scan that QR code

933
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,119
if you want the slides or just CS

934
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,918
um I'll give you my card and email me

935
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,420
and I'll give it to you

936
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,740
um I actually have a TAP card you could

937
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,119
just fill in your email address and and

938
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,280
I can send it to you so apologies for

939
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,560
those slides being blank uh but if you

940
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,000
have any questions we're happy to take

941
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,540
them now and also 100 the best place to
