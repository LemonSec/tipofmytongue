1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,960
foreign

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm not going to get an introduction

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,580
oh I'm doing an introduction geez excuse

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,280
me

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,480
in case you haven't met Heather

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,100
do you need to take the brown M M's out

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,480
of the your backstage like

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,320
yes no just kidding okay so we

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,480
we have some slides for you

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,020
um Phil has the perfect links to post

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,940
into the slack at the perfect time for

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,899
this

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,340
um I do recommend that you click on all

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,600
of them take a look at what we're

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,620
talking about

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,640
this will not fill I think the entire 50

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,680
minutes allotted to us so what we're

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,879
going to do is we're going to do some

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,520
fun quizzing and questioning

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,160
we'll just get you involved for the

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,860
remainder of the time until it leads up

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,039
to Mr whitfield's fancy presentation and

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,420
just so you know a little bit of what we

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,620
want to make sure we do as well we've

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,480
got a few folks who are in other tracks

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,739
we want to make sure we give them a time

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,299
to finish out their material get in here

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,400
so that they can see the uh the

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
presentations as well so we're

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
reconverging the timelines which is

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
always well I mean the sacred timeline

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
you know that that's complicated so it's

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,420
a lot of fun

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,960
all right so official updates in dfir

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,119
and there are stickers that were out

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,259
there I saw a lot of them are already

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,720
gone also last chance for the posters

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,420
there's some extra Legos I believe out

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,820
there so if you don't even like them for

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,320
yourself if you know someone else that

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,759
likes Legos feel free to help yourself

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,680
to them

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,780
the first thing this was released this

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,579
morning and Rob brought it up during his

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,439
keynote The Ultimate Guide to getting

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,000
started in digital forensics and

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
incident response

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,600
um one name was really left off the

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
authorship and that's Viv who took

50
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,439
this nightmare of a working document I

51
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,060
made it into this beautiful product if

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,380
you could have seen what that looked

53
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,960
like it was a giant nightmare but what

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
we wanted to do with this and this is a

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,500
project that Viv has been wanting to do

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,420
for a really long time and I'm actually

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,479
doing a webcast on September 1st I

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,560
believe

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,020
just being interviewed on women in cyber

60
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,060
security how you got started where you

61
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,319
want to go next and who has helped you

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,780
along the way so that is also going to

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,879
be featured there but in this we are

64
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,459
covering free resources to include the

65
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,780
webcasts YouTube channels blogs podcasts

66
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,000
um different networking methods and

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,260
resources so low cost to free because

68
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,420
kind not everything is exactly free but

69
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,640
low cost conferences and things that you

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,260
can go to that isn't going to cost you

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,660
thousands of dollars to attend some of

72
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,640
these things

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,260
mentorship opportunities and this is a

74
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,220
big one

75
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,239
different methods that you can go to and

76
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,040
leverage to find someone to help you in

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,019
your career if you want to make a change

78
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,940
if you want to get started as Rob was

79
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,680
saying this morning don't always chase

80
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
the money if you really like it it won't

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,060
feel like a job so people to help you

82
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,580
along the way sometimes mentorship just

83
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,860
happens naturally half the time I think

84
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,480
people Mentor you and don't even realize

85
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,940
they're doing it that's me I'm like I

86
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,319
don't even know I'm doing it it just

87
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,659
happens but it's a good place to start

88
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,920
because many people don't know where to

89
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,019
start or they're too timid to just reach

90
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,000
out and say hi I follow you and can you

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,220
help me do X but if you don't ask the

92
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,260
answer is always no so keep that in mind

93
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,180
yeah and on that note I would also say

94
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,599
you'd be may be surprised to realize how

95
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,640
open and accommodating and eager to help

96
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,319
a lot of folks in this community truly

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,220
are

98
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,480
um you know you've got this opportunity

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,099
to reach out to people who are writing

100
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,780
the tools that you rely on on a daily

101
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,060
basis and help to improve that

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,400
um you know so my note that I got a out

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,260
of questions talk is all right um I

104
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,459
think I know somebody who can help with

105
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,860
soft l I'm gonna go ahead and work on

106
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,299
that dashboard he said that's something

107
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,519
that he wasn't able to do so that

108
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,500
collaborative nature that you see not

109
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,239
just from a mentorship perspective but

110
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,580
from that kind of support it's a great

111
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,319
way to get involved whether it's finding

112
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,000
new artifacts whether it's submitting

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,959
them and we're going to talk a little

114
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,299
bit about those as well any little thing

115
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,459
you do to just kind of put it out there

116
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm not saying you have to use Twitter

117
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,159
but like to put something out there that

118
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,680
says hey I did this cool thing and then

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,060
you go to sleep and you wake up the next

120
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,380
morning you're like holy crap there's

121
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,560
the 5 000 likes and 3 000 retweets or

122
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,260
something that is a very real way to

123
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,360
kind of put yourself into the community

124
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,040
and kind of get to be in a position

125
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,380
where you're making a name for yourself

126
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,120
and you're contributing in a way that

127
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,940
doesn't require the cost

128
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,580
yeah exactly thank you Phil I like that

129
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,139
almost like we work well together

130
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,259
there's also a brief snippet in the

131
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,419
guide for forensics 308 which is the

132
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,520
digital forensic Essentials class and

133
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
forensics 498 which is currently

134
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,060
Battlefield forensics but is going

135
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,100
through a name change later this year

136
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,020
and it's going to be Dart as I like to

137
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,060
call it digital acquisition and Rapid

138
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,060
triage so make sure you take a look at

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,940
those and I'll talk more about some free

140
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,500
little glimpses you can get of these

141
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,759
courses the final thing in the doc cat

142
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
Headley was interviewed on just being

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,160
new to defer what does it mean how to

144
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,780
get started and it's a question and

145
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,759
answer session with her so I definitely

146
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,080
recommend reading that and then there's

147
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,639
a small little closeout and hopefully

148
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,280
something motivational from me that's in

149
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,340
that also untimely nature Hitchhiker's

150
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,280
Guide to defer by Andrew Rathbun and

151
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,240
kind of the Discord family Discord

152
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,680
contributors came together and wrote

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,340
another guide on getting started and how

154
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,960
to do things so these are two free

155
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,780
resources for you definitely leverage

156
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,520
them share them with people if people

157
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,780
come up and say how do I get started

158
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,639
doing what you're doing Point them to

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,259
things like this that way you're not

160
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,300
Reinventing the wheel yeah and one thing

161
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,860
I'll mention on that that um Discord

162
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,960
server as well a lot of times folks

163
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,759
whether it be here at a summit or in a

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,560
class or just talking generally out

165
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,660
there and internet land they say well

166
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,280
where where do we go to continue this

167
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
conversation because remember the slack

168
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,400
that we're in right now this is going to

169
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,560
go away later this evening

170
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,620
um but Andrew has done a fantastic job

171
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,660
of putting together and moderating the

172
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,759
digital forensics Discord server that's

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,740
a great place to go probably the

174
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,380
foremost Community Building platform for

175
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,120
digital forensics and incident response

176
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,639
and you know we really recommend folks

177
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,979
go to so um yeah Tony just dropped the

178
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,440
link here in chat do join that check it

179
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,819
out even if you're just lurking you're

180
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,900
going to get a chance to kind of

181
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,400
experience a lot of the the community

182
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,139
building that we were talking about I

183
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,880
think there's over 10 000 members in it

184
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
and there is a Sans channel in there for

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,300
deeper

186
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,740
um we promise we're not going to spam

187
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,479
you we'll let you know of new courses

188
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,000
free resources live streams things like

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,319
that so it's not a place that we're

190
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,479
going to try to sell you something

191
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,180
another thing that Andrew has done he's

192
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,860
kind of falling into this category of No

193
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,160
Sleep as well he is creating the D for

194
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,620
artifact Museum and he has been on me to

195
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,000
contribute to this he just sent me a

196
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,300
hard drive this week which I will get to

197
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,400
instead of loading full forensic images

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,380
which we all know how much space that

199
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,639
will take and you don't have time to sit

200
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,380
there and parse it it's specific

201
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,860
artifacts from Mac from Linux from PCS

202
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,979
I'm sending him IOS and Android from all

203
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,080
the different versions so I have stuff

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
as old as I think like iPhone 6 or iOS

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,240
6. so all of those things all the

206
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,800
different Android versions different

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,139
application artifacts it's all test data

208
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,900
that will be posted here for you so this

209
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,180
is on GitHub I strongly recommend you

210
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,919
follow that you never know when you're

211
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,479
going to need something if you have

212
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,699
something to contribute please reach out

213
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,560
and he will send you a link

214
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,080
um he and Kevin Pagano are even willing

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
to take images from you and strip out

216
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,419
what they need so if you're like I have

217
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,620
stuff I just don't have time to deal

218
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,819
with it that's what I'm doing I'm

219
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,139
sending all the images and they're just

220
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,880
going to piece it out into what's

221
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,740
relevant so please contribute it's

222
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,259
definitely helpful

223
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,020
all right some new things at Sands here

224
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,380
so two new GX certs the first one is the

225
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,479
Gimme this is Sarah cert

226
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,319
so the giac iOS and Mac examiner

227
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,360
um a long time she's been waiting for

228
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,900
this cert a long long time and it's

229
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,460
definitely something that's needed it

230
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,680
will be the first vendor neutral Max

231
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,819
cert

232
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,680
um I know that companies like the one I

233
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,360
work for my day job also have them but

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,879
that is vendor specific so it is vendor

235
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,580
neutral I definitely recommend this and

236
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,879
then the cloud team standing back here

237
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,680
thank you

238
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,320
they have their gcfr that goes along

239
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,839
with 509 and now something everyone is

240
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,640
always like great I already took that

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,399
class well there's good news you can get

242
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,380
an alumni discount if you want to take

243
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,760
the cert

244
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,580
um something that I would ask Sarah and

245
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,800
Dave and team to think about I have

246
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,240
people reach out to me all the time and

247
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,399
say I just took this class in this

248
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,380
version do you think it's safe to take

249
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,360
the cert and my answer is I don't know

250
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
this is at your own risk obviously the

251
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,339
cert is going to be written for Sarah do

252
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,959
you know which version yours is written

253
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:04,740
for

254
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,480
and newer

255
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,779
is it h01

256
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,980
G something okay and Dave is yours h01

257
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,940
he's not listening

258
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,040
do you know which version of the course

259
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,860
the cert was based on for the initial

260
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,620
was it h01

261
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,560
h03 okay so obviously you could do it at

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,060
your own risk you could be insane and

263
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,680
take it with no books and that's a

264
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
terrible thing to do I did that with my

265
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,820
own cert and it didn't go well

266
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,839
foreign

267
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,480
it's a scary scary thing yeah and

268
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,980
something that I mentioned all my

269
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,779
students as well that you may not

270
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,820
realize is even though Sans and giac you

271
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,260
know really appear to be connected at

272
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,700
the hip and in some ways that's a fair

273
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,899
assessment

274
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,980
um they're actually separate

275
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,080
organizations so we as instructors as

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,160
authors

277
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,560
for the most part we don't have insight

278
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,300
into what goes into those exams or

279
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,100
anything so when you ask us hey should

280
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,440
we take it a lot of times we'll kind of

281
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,600
clam up and be like well we don't know

282
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,580
because we don't know what exactly is on

283
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,260
those exams we're not allowed to in most

284
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,360
cases so that's why we always say like

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
these kinds of Arrangements that are put

286
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,019
out there are really designed to make

287
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,399
sure that you get the right latest

288
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,260
greatest material that's paired back up

289
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,779
and kind of have that most close uh

290
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,180
alignment with uh the the material to

291
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,600
the exam but also to recognize that we

292
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,640
really value the early phase input that

293
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
we get from our Alpha and our beta

294
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,120
students in the very early ones so we

295
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,200
want to make sure that that's not

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,760
something that's inaccessible to you

297
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
because we realize that's not fair so we

298
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,420
work very closely with the sales teams

299
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,399
to make sure that there's a fair Pathway

300
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,440
to get you the latest which is going to

301
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,420
help you to maximize your chances on the

302
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,040
certification attempts

303
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,260
and if you ever want to repeat a Sans

304
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,220
course

305
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,339
you get that alumni discount to retake

306
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,079
that exact course even if it's not for

307
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,640
the cert but you have to reach out to

308
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,440
Sans to register and they will help you

309
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,120
do it you can't click a button or get a

310
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,980
magic code for online so make sure you

311
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,380
are contacting Sans

312
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,880
and since you're speaking about Alpha

313
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,880
and beta new stuff that is coming out so

314
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,320
you can see things that are already

315
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,019
being advertised are there on the right

316
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,640
um I'm going to talk about some of the

317
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,760
other things in just a little brief

318
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,240
Glimpse here so forensics 528 Ryan

319
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,579
Chapman wrote this course it is our

320
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,040
ransomware for incident response the

321
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
alpha just completed and there is a beta

322
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
happening September 19th now you're

323
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,060
hearing this new term Alpha and this is

324
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,620
new to us as well this is something that

325
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,260
we just implemented if you deem yourself

326
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,160
an expert in a trade that is going into

327
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,140
a class so let's say you are an expert

328
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,620
for example in memory forensics you're

329
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,839
like I could do that you could sit a

330
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,360
Sans course for free it's an alpha you

331
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,100
don't get printed books you have to

332
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,339
understand it is Alpha you are testing

333
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,779
things things could be broken they

334
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,880
shouldn't be but you're expected to give

335
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,980
thorough feedback because you are good

336
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,200
at that skill if you think you can do

337
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
this there are two ways to go about it

338
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,800
you can reach out to me and then I'm

339
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
also going to point you to the course

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,380
authors and say hey do you know this

341
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,180
person are you okay with this do you

342
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,279
want them to sit your alpha or two go

343
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,839
straight to the course author and say

344
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,640
hey I would like to be in your Alpha I'm

345
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,040
interested this is a skill I have so as

346
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,660
you see these courses coming up that are

347
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,940
in development if that is something you

348
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,060
think you could do fantastic and we kind

349
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,399
of have a general idea Henry I'm looking

350
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
at you now a general idea of when Alpha

351
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,300
will occur but obviously that slides

352
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,519
based upon course turn in so right now

353
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,320
the alpha is going to be the end of

354
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,240
August for the new Enterprise memory

355
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,100
forensics class that

356
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
um Matt Fuchs is writing you can check

357
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,079
that out

358
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,320
589 this is coming in 2023. so we have

359
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
Sean O'Connor is the primary author and

360
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,220
he just recruited a few more to assist

361
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,560
with this and it's going to be cyber

362
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,320
crime intelligence blockchain

363
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,720
um some dark web all those kinds of

364
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,760
things so that obviously will have an

365
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,279
alpha as well if that's kind of you

366
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,019
let me know I can introduce you with

367
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,060
Sean and others

368
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,920
another one that's coming in 2023

369
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,180
where's Taz

370
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,339
yep what's the date on this sir what do

371
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,560
you think

372
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,579
foreign

373
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,800
no pressure

374
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
okay Linux forensics

375
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,920
um Taz will obviously probably I don't

376
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,180
know I think you could have a hard time

377
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,040
finding the proper crowd for this so if

378
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,800
you know Linux and when I say expert if

379
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,360
you're passionate about it if you care

380
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,339
about it you do it in the workplace

381
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,260
take the alpha you don't have to be that

382
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,300
you are the master you have zero

383
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,160
imposter syndrome if you care about it

384
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,920
and it's your passion ask because again

385
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,720
it's freestands training and the answer

386
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,980
is no if you don't ask we don't know

387
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,200
that you exist yeah and the big thing

388
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,700
about this whole new Alpha process we

389
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,380
invested a lot of time and effort into

390
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,459
this

391
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,779
um we really wanted to make sure that we

392
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:54,000
get a representative sample of inputs

393
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,040
from across the community so I won't

394
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,720
bore you with all the like worry

395
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,339
technical details behind it in the

396
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,440
parameters but we're not going to do an

397
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,779
alpha for

398
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:05,940
XYZ company where we put all 20 people

399
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,139
from one company because that's not

400
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,160
going to give us a sample that

401
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
represents all of your perspectives and

402
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,779
workloads right so we've really built

403
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,820
this around a desire to make sure that

404
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,680
when we get this into the classroom for

405
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,079
the first live runs that this is

406
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,000
something that is going to hit the mark

407
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,680
for the widest number of potential

408
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,019
students so there's a trade-off there

409
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,880
like you know we're very obviously

410
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,440
making a big deal out of the fact that

411
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,779
it is a no-cost training opportunity but

412
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,120
you know you're with this in Big Air

413
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,360
quotes here your your payment to us is

414
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,420
detailed feedback on down to the like

415
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,940
this lab this question

416
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,300
just doesn't make sense to me because so

417
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,680
you're certainly familiar with all the

418
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,300
evaluations that we have in our courses

419
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,540
that's like a scratching the surface of

420
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,980
the type of feedback that we bring in

421
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,240
from these Alpha so that's kind of the

422
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,160
trade-off that we have there and

423
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
certainly we appreciate having that

424
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,360
experience from from all of your case

425
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,279
work in your workload so that we can

426
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,959
make sure that that material is the best

427
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,760
it possibly can be and really put that

428
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,040
final level of polish on it

429
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,440
all right the next one 548 Mr

430
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,860
whitfield's class e-discovery

431
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,680
we put out surveys and I know that Viv

432
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,959
posted it in the channel and Phil's

433
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,279
going to post it again

434
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,500
the it's going to ask you key questions

435
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,260
so for example we did one for 577 and we

436
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,639
wanted to know how long do you think

437
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,399
this Linux forensics class should be we

438
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,620
learned very quickly that dfir does not

439
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,600
like two-day courses at all it's not

440
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,880
good most people want five or six days

441
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,459
but we ask specific things too so the

442
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,680
survey is for Lee to give information

443
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,899
back to Lee if you have things you want

444
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:45,060
to share with Taz and Lee like hey this

445
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,620
would be awesome this is what's lacking

446
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,940
from other courses

447
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,500
they're sitting right back there in the

448
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,360
back of the room and willing to take

449
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,100
your information

450
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,800
um also I have a random question this is

451
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,779
not in the poll what happens is people

452
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,339
will write proposals and send them to me

453
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:00,720
saying hey I want to write a course for

454
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,000
Sans and I say okay quickly what is it

455
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,620
going to be about why should we do this

456
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,940
how long and then they go through this

457
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,519
formal proposal process

458
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,459
Insider threat do you think Sans needs

459
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,800
an Insider threat course

460
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,420
I'm really torn on this raise your hand

461
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,920
if you would attend an Insider threat

462
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,420
course

463
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,060
okay that's what I was assuming okay

464
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,399
just curious but it's so much better to

465
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,120
find that out now yes yes it is

466
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,699
so please take the survey it's quick

467
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:31,079
um I think it's like five questions or

468
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,839
less pretty painless hopefully but it's

469
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,339
going to give Lee some good information

470
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,980
and Lee assuming the survey comes back

471
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,600
with what you expect are you thinking

472
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,339
2023

473
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,199
he's not listening now

474
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,600
2023 Yes No Maybe

475
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,500
depends

476
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,079
sure ends up being my fault I see how it

477
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,800
is

478
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,699
foreign

479
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,780
indirectly not answer that how's that

480
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,939
for a double almost negative um Henry

481
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:13,500
can answer it more specifically it gets

482
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,179
a little bit complicated in that

483
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,179
um realize that the alpha being a uh you

484
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,579
know Alpha is not a full public class

485
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,040
run so there's a little bit different

486
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,439
um I'll defer that to Henry because I'll

487
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,760
be completely honest with everybody in

488
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,280
here the alpha process is brand new and

489
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,660
although we've got a pretty good package

490
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,340
put together right now for what that

491
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,780
process looks like it's still being

492
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,340
refined and some of those questions are

493
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,780
a little bit nuanced I don't want to

494
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,760
like we're being recorded I don't want

495
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,500
this to you know an accidental

496
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,360
well-intentioned statement to become

497
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,860
policy because then Henry's going to be

498
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,720
mad at me but if you take the beta you

499
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,120
get the alumni discount correct Henry or

500
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,840
no

501
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,020
foreign

502
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,700
right there to the man backed by Taz

503
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
all right for the rest of you there like

504
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,000
I will never do an alpha

505
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,100
um I have not attended any training

506
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,320
because it's expensive and out of my

507
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,700
budget what can you do to get into the

508
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,100
classroom so obviously the alumni

509
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,660
discount I just mentioned that would not

510
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,919
matter to you if you have not taken

511
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:12,780
Sam's training before we have a work

512
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,240
study program and what you do you hand

513
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,799
out the evals you help the instructor

514
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,200
with anything that goes wrong say Zoom

515
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,480
crashes their clicker runs out of

516
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,700
batteries it can be honestly anything

517
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,299
but your main role is to make sure

518
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,320
everyone that's physically in that

519
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
classroom has a badge on and that you

520
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,799
hand out evals so you put a link in

521
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:34,740
slack and for that you get a steep steep

522
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,440
discount as a work study and once you

523
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,299
get into work study I feel like people

524
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:41,520
tend to stay in that role and then

525
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,880
eventually you can promote to the TA for

526
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,200
some classes if you're doing really well

527
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
and instructors like you and that ta

528
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
role becomes a paid job than for Sans

529
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,299
and typically that then feeds into do

530
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,980
you want to start instructor development

531
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,020
so there's a lot of Pathways with the

532
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,120
work study and the link is there for you

533
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
if you do sign up for a work study and

534
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
you're worried about it I'm happy to

535
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,640
help you if you reach out to me and say

536
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,880
hey I would like to to take 508 be the

537
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,100
work study with Chad Tilbury I will put

538
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
you in touch with Chad and with Kapil

539
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,700
and say hey can we work this so we can

540
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
get this person involved in the

541
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,640
classroom

542
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,980
and then the final way if you are local

543
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,960
or state law enforcement we have a law

544
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,539
enforcement appreciation program and you

545
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,539
can get 50 off the Sans courses so just

546
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,400
something to consider and sadly that is

547
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,679
North America only please do not freak

548
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,720
out for me saying that to you I

549
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,460
apologize

550
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,799
just is

551
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,480
but you could do the work study if

552
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,380
you're not in North America

553
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,580
all right some other resources the Sans

554
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,340
toolbox this is new and what we're doing

555
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,120
here is demos on how to use tools so

556
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,500
you'll have instructors that will walk

557
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,840
you through the sift workstation I think

558
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,140
Carlos is going to be doing Velociraptor

559
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,000
um even commercial tools so I'm

560
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,679
considering asking magnet and celebrate

561
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,720
if they want me to as they worded it

562
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,299
give an appetizer on how to use these

563
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:07,620
tools so then it feeds into the

564
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,660
commercial vendor training so we're

565
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,460
trying different things here but it's

566
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,840
one of those things say you're taking a

567
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,880
class and you're like Phil I don't know

568
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,100
how to use soft help to do XYZ he'll say

569
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,380
go to the toolbox there's a video on it

570
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,480
and it's 10 minutes long and you can

571
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,500
watch it tonight and then you'll be

572
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,480
better at your Labs tomorrow so all of

573
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,080
these things will go into that Sans

574
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,059
toolbox if you have something that you

575
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,679
would like to see there when you want to

576
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,600
do the presentation if you reach out to

577
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,980
me I can put you in touch with the

578
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,419
people who are creating the toolbox

579
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,160
we're happy to have you

580
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,740
there's live streams Viv schedules all

581
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,360
kinds of live streams and these are free

582
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,720
and it's a fantastic way to identify a

583
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,299
few things one do you like the person

584
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,280
that's presenting to you because I think

585
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,020
getting the best Sans experience is

586
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,520
finding a class where you have an

587
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,380
instructor that speaks your language or

588
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,179
can talk to you if that makes sense

589
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,220
there are so many different tones and

590
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,620
styles of instructors if you have

591
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,780
someone that you cannot handle the sound

592
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,340
of their voice or you don't like how

593
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,200
much they move around or that they talk

594
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,520
with their hands you don't want to sit

595
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,559
there with them for six days so it's a

596
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,880
good way for you to see different

597
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,580
presentation Styles but also learn new

598
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,360
techniques and capabilities and just

599
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,039
anything we're researching that's new

600
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,380
for free so these live streams are all

601
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,520
free

602
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,340
and a lot of these uh live streams we

603
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,740
all we have archived on our page we also

604
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,059
have a number of these that make its way

605
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,120
out too that sansdfir YouTube channel

606
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,500
um which we put on you know that's where

607
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,720
Kevin uh Ripa's three minute Max goes

608
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,940
these talks as I mentioned make their

609
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,500
way out there eventually we try to put a

610
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,880
lot of that content there for you to

611
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,860
consume at your own pace

612
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,200
um you're hilarious at 2x by the way

613
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,179
just listening to you at 2x but uh

614
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,860
suffice to say you get to do that on

615
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,679
your own if you'd like

616
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,780
good Lord and then there's white papers

617
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,360
blogs deeper tools I'm going to talk you

618
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,620
through the course preview here in a

619
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,179
second I'm going to use 509 as an

620
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:03,179
example but as far as blogs white papers

621
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,440
there's also something called the Sans

622
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,480
reading room and I have been pushing

623
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,520
this a lot since I became curriculum

624
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,679
lead if you

625
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,380
research something and it adds value to

626
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,780
a specific course so say you research

627
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,539
something smartphone related and it's

628
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:21,480
relevant for example Shafiq punja and

629
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,380
Ian wiffin did determining deleted data

630
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,780
and sqlite databases they gave it to me

631
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,059
I gave it to Viv it goes to the Sans

632
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,919
reading room and they earn a class coin

633
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,900
now it's up to the author if they want

634
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,780
to award you a class coin for that

635
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,820
research that will then be helpful and

636
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,380
beneficial to their course

637
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,059
um Lenny zeltzer is really good at

638
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:43,500
people that want to do any kind of

639
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,600
reverse engineering papers he loves

640
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,700
approving it and giving a class coin so

641
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,080
it's just something else you can do to

642
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,780
kind of give back and earn something as

643
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,780
a token of gratitude from Sans

644
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,260
course previews so what we do in dfir

645
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,840
and Viv works with all of us authors

646
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,080
when we record and we put our course

647
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,200
together we choose a snippet of the

648
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,940
course that we want to provide to you

649
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,039
for free so this is a good way you can

650
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,260
go out to every single D for course and

651
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,760
you go out and you find one so I chose

652
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,100
Cloud here and what you do is you click

653
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,500
on course demo now these could be

654
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,720
anywhere from like 25 minutes to an hour

655
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,340
long I believe what's do you know what

656
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,020
the longest one is

657
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,780
an hour yeah so you could get a lot of

658
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,820
good Snippets if you're new to defer and

659
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,620
you don't know what interests you this

660
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,900
is a good stopping point for you like go

661
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,580
there and take a look at some of these

662
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,620
things so here we click on course demo

663
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,799
you sign into your Sands and Dave

664
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,980
appears here momentarily so you'll see

665
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,700
he chose Microsoft Azure section and if

666
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,320
you look at the little box down below

667
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,880
it's going to tell you all the sections

668
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,500
that are going to be covered it looks

669
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,320
exactly like an on-demand experience and

670
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,059
that's what you're seeing and then Dave

671
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,220
starts talking your slides are there

672
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,860
it's essentially the same experience I

673
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,380
think in mine I did a lab review I don't

674
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,580
think I did the whole Lab but you may

675
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,620
see Snippets of that too where someone

676
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,840
is going to teach you a concept show you

677
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
what a lab could look like and then you

678
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,500
get an idea or a little bit of a feel

679
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,299
for that course yeah and keep in mind

680
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,340
that it's the primary course author who

681
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,080
makes the determination on what goes

682
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,299
into these previews we work as Heather

683
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,220
said closely with bib but it's the

684
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,700
author saying this really is the the

685
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,340
Highlight that I want to be kind of that

686
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,980
that summary of um you know the material

687
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,900
so that author gets to make that

688
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,159
determination you're really getting a

689
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,340
best best put forward at that point

690
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,360
um and something else I'll mention

691
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,539
alongside the course previews please do

692
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:43,860
make sure as you're looking at either

693
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,620
are newer existing courses spend some

694
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,960
time going through the course summary

695
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,659
that's on our website I can tell you

696
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,120
from my own personal experience I'm

697
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,980
sorry Viv because you keep asking me for

698
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,539
updates and things and sometimes I'm not

699
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,100
as responsive as you would like me to be

700
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,559
it takes a lot of time for us to put

701
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,940
that in there it's not just a simple

702
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,460
outline every module every lab

703
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,220
everything is laid out in pretty low

704
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,919
level detail in order to help you make a

705
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,720
good decision on is this the right

706
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
course and hey if you're still having

707
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,559
questions beyond that not a problem

708
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,080
that's where we're all very accessible

709
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,419
you can reach out to any of us via the

710
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,280
various social media or email and we're

711
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,840

712
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,279
least direct you to somebody that can

713
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,279
give the most and most relevant feedback

714
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,960
on that so that you can make a good

715
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,000
decision there too and you'll also find

716
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,799
justification letters if you need to

717
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,000
explain to your manager or your

718
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,679
workplace why you need this training and

719
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,419
how it will make you better at your job

720
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:42,539
so those also exist there

721
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,700
D for net Wars I think we have some of

722
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,640
the net Wars authors lingering around in

723
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,740
here so D4 networks we have three

724
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,419
different ways to play right now net

725
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:53,580
Wars tournament which is regular net

726
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,440
Wars run at events and then there's

727
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,779
coins layer points layer is this week

728
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,279
correct Sarah

729
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,220
yeah it's a coin Slayer which means you

730
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,260
get a chance to win every single class

731
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,659
coin that Sans has you have to answer

732
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,480
all those questions correct so and it's

733
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,580
individual no teams but it's a lot of

734
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,440
fun the coin Slayer is super super cool

735
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,419
and then there's net worth continuous

736
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,640
which is online and you can play for a

737
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,299
period of Time network 2.0 is going to

738
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,580
be released this fall brand new

739
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,500
questions brand new data sets things

740
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,179
you've never seen and it's going to

741
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,820
include every single course at Sans and

742
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,679
you'll see some of them like for 308 for

743
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,200
example you may not have level four 308

744
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,880
questions because it's a three level

745
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,340
class and then you may find that 710

746
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,080
isn't going to have level one questions

747
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,779
because it's seven level class so you

748
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:44,760
may see that little

749
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,559
difference there from what you're used

750
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,740
to
