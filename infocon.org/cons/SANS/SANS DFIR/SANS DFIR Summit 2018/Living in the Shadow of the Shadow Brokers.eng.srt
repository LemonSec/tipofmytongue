1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,069
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,345
(audience applauds)

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,847
- Gotta little bit
of time this morning,

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,549
before we get going and talk
a little about the agenda.

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,819
Originally this
was supposed to be

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,389
a combination talk here
with me and Matt Suiche.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,923
If you're not
familiar with Matt,

8
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:27,026
Matt does an amazing amount
of work in memory forensics

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,762
and well in
forensics in general,

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,363
incident response community.

11
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,131
He was also called out
by the Shadow Brokers.

12
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,766
We were actually
called out together.

13
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,136
They correctly identified
where I used to work

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,670
and totally messed up with Matt,

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,305
because I don't think
Matt ever worked there.

16
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:40,907
He's not even a U.S. citizen.

17
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:43,309
So probably not a good match,

18
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,345
but Matt took it like champ

19
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,147
and he's been doing
a lot of, again,

20
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,015
speaking truth to
power kind of things.

21
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,383
That's what I was
gonna hit, actually,

22
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,818
the truth to power thing,

23
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,187
because Rob's not quite
telling the truth there, right?

24
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,823
He says, yeah, and
I appreciate that.

25
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,892
But when I got in a fight
with the White House

26
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,326
and an official
White House account

27
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,595
started fighting back
at me in January,

28
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,263
we were together at a SANS event

29
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,199
and I assure you that Rob's
demeanor looked nothing

30
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,401
like it did up here on
stage a few minutes ago

31
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,836
when that occurred.

32
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,405
So when the White House takes
you on that's kind of a,

33
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,141
also I was looking above for
a drone strike at the point,

34
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,376
anytime we were outdoors.

35
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,744
(audience laughs)

36
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,512
But anyway Matt was
supposed to be here.

37
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,980
Matt unfortunately
couldn't make it.

38
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,016
He had a big incident
response piece kick off

39
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,250
about three weeks ago,

40
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,518
knew he wasn't gonna
be able to make it

41
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,053
and we started
shifting stuff around.

42
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,655
So unfortunately,
there's some stuff

43
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,659
that I can't say up here
because of my background

44
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,594
that I was heavily
depending on Matt to say.

45
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,095
Not because we
coordinated anything,

46
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,364
but I saw Matt's Blackhat
presentation last year,

47
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,667
and said hey, if you wanna go

48
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,702
and talk about some of this
other stuff, that'd be awesome.

49
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,170
And he's like oh yeah, totally,

50
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,705
I'm gonna hit this,
this, this, and this.

51
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,307
And I'm like, that's
outstanding man,

52
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,610
'cause I can just shut up and
you can do whatever you want

53
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,911
and good to go.

54
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,913
So that doesn't meant
this is gonna bad talk

55
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,348
or a boring talk, just a
slightly different talk

56
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,818
than we were planning
to have before.

57
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,018
So who am I?

58
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,122
I work with SANS obviously

59
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,957
and I work with
IANS, Rally Security,

60
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,824
founder of Rendition Infosec,

61
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,862
former NSA hacker,
Master CNE operator.

62
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,797
I hate people that call
themselves thought leaders.

63
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,433
If you have to call yourself
a thought leader, you're not.

64
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,368
That's usually a pretty
good start there.

65
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,338
Crypto bros, absolutely,
and if you needless add

66
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,141
blockchain to a software
solution, I will hunt you down.

67
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,777
So let's talk about
what are we gonna cover.

68
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,912
I wanna talk about the
history of the dumps.

69
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,015
I'd like to talk a little
bit about why I think

70
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,183
Shadow Brokers are targeting

71
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,051
some individuals and not others.

72
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,119
I have no doubt they
have a lot more data

73
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,222
then they've released already.

74
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,957
Why should you as a digital
forensics professional,

75
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,192
I think this is the
most important thing

76
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,426
we're gonna cover today,

77
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,960
why should you a digital
forensics professional

78
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,931
be studying these and other
intelligence community leaks

79
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,534
even when your boss says don't?

80
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,168
Now I know this is a
controversial topic.

81
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,737
I've written on
this in the past.

82
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,940
I've gotten a lot of flames
coming back here from that,

83
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,011
but this is a hill I'm
willin' to die on, literally.

84
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,114
But again, a lotta folks here,

85
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,515
because of their
security clearances,

86
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,683
because of where they work,

87
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,285
because they have
government connections,

88
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,520
are told don't go
look at these dumps.

89
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,522
They're classified data,
they remained classified

90
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,024
until the government
declassifies,

91
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,392
even though it's on the internet

92
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,894
for everyone to see.

93
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,729
And I think those laws, and I
think a lotta those policies

94
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,032
haven't caught up with,
well, the digital age

95
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,667
that we all live in today.

96
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,868
Well you should
be studying these.

97
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,536
I'm gonna walk through
a few reasons why.

98
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,505
Probably make a couple
folks in here uncomfortable,

99
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:26,706
but that's fine.

100
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,308
I wanna talk about
the DFIR implications

101
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,709
of the Shadow Brokers
dumps in general as well.

102
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,880
Yeah, here's what
we're not gonna cover.

103
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,481
We're not gonna talk about
any classified information

104
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,950
not already in the public.

105
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,218
All right, when I say not
already in the public,

106
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,720
for those that have
a security clearance

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,255
and are super
worried about this,

108
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,357
I will tell you have a couple
screenshots from the dump,

109
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,726
so if you need to leave
now, by all means, take off.

110
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,161
I'm good with that.

111
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,896
I won't confirm that
these tools belong to NSA.

112
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,464
Right, I think other people
have already done that.

113
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,700
You certainly won't here
me talking about that.

114
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,569
I won't talk about what
specifically I did for NSA

115
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,970
or why I left.

116
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,505
I'm also not gonna talk
about who I think the

117
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,241
Shadow Brokers are, 'cause I
think that's been well covered

118
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,077
by lots of other
people and all that.

119
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh wait, so who are
the Shadow Brokers?

120
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,148
I know I said I wasn't
gonna cover this,

121
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,018
but we start talking
about who are they,

122
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,286
what's the motivation?

123
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,454
When we start doing
threat intelligence,

124
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,089
and I don't think
Robert Lee is here yet,

125
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,625
but he's teaching the awesome
578 course here this week,

126
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,125
the threat intelligence course.

127
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,363
And when we start looking at
a threat, threat intelligence,

128
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,465
of course certainly Shadow
Brokers applies here,

129
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,232
what we're lookin' at
here is the intersection

130
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,402
between intent,
opportunity, and capability.

131
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,770
And by the way if you're
trying to remember that,

132
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,971
that's I-O-C.

133
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,106
Right, so as threat
hunters we all remember

134
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,474
indicators of compromise,

135
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,276
intent, opportunity,
and capability.

136
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,878
From a capability standpoint,

137
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,313
there's no question
that these folks, right,

138
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,782
have some awesome capabilities.

139
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,450
Either they've got a great
insider who's feeding 'em data

140
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,322
or they've got a way to
get classified data out of

141
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,624
what should be one of
the most secure places

142
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,759
I would think on the planet.

143
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,028
So capability wise I think good.

144
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,630
Also capability wise,
they've evaded capture

145
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,967
for gosh, we're goin'
on 18 months now, right?

146
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,269
Evaded capture for
well over 18 months.

147
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,972
I guess almost, little bit
more than 18 months, right,

148
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,407
even with the full power of the

149
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,810
U.S. Signals
Intelligence Community,

150
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,546
the law enforcement community
etc., tracking these folks.

151
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,883
So I'd say capability wise
they're probably a top tier.

152
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,484
From an opportunity standpoint,

153
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,986
hey, I mean the internet's
there you can dump, rock on.

154
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,288
From an intent standpoint,

155
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,057
that's really what I
like to look at, right,

156
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,625
is what was the
timing of the dumps,

157
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,294
when did those come out, what
else is going around there,

158
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,395
what were they trying to
steal the media cycle from.

159
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,598
I know a lotta people
believe they're Russian.

160
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,467
I'm not gonna weigh
in on this but...

161
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,305
Anyway, so I'll
leave that there.

162
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,840
I will say, as we start talking

163
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
about the timing of the dumps,

164
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,378
as far as how did
the tools get out,

165
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,181
that's a question that
I really can't answer.

166
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,717
I do have possibilities
as far as insider threats.

167
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,954
This is obviously a
possible piece here.

168
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,689
I will say that I'm
happy they've identified

169
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,358
a leaker in the Vault7 case.

170
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,959
I don't know if
anybody's following this.

171
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,461
There's a gentleman in
custody up in New York

172
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,197
who they've identified
in the CIA leak case.

173
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,833
Certainly there was
some initial thought,

174
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,602
I know among some folks,
that maybe the Vault7

175
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,471
and Shadow Brokers
things were related.

176
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,040
Perhaps they are,
don't know, certainly.

177
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,976
But insider threats are
possible as we well know.

178
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,313
It could be a hack
of NSA's networks.

179
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,582
I'd love to believe
this isn't possible.

180
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,351
I wish, I certainly wanna
believe it's not possible,

181
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,953
but it could be.

182
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,020
In the realm of
infinity possibilities
there's Hal Martin,

183
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,891
a gentleman who walked
out of secure facilities

184
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,993
with 50 terabytes of data.

185
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,928
So I mean I would step
back maybe and think,

186
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,431
is that data among
the 50 terabytes.

187
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,702
And my guess is, that even
NSA probably doesn't know.

188
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,239
I think at the point that
you lost 50 terabytes

189
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,506
without realizing it,

190
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:48,875
I think it's very
difficult to claim

191
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,177
that you know everything
about what was taken.

192
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:55,882
I think that's a tall order,
a large claim to make there.

193
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,217
Kaspersky, and I'm not gonna
put a tin foil hat on up here,

194
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,053
but the reality is that we know

195
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,223
that at least one developer
was taking work home

196
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,560
and if that was happening
and nobody was catching it,

197
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,761
I have to ask you the question,

198
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,763
were other developers
taking work home?

199
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,364
Were other people
taking work home?

200
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,866
Hal Martin certainly was as well

201
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,435
and was getting away with it.

202
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,104
So when NSA or anybody
else comes back and says,

203
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,906
no, no, that was an
isolated incident,

204
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,441
my follow up is,
how do do you know?

205
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,674
Right, and of course,

206
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,910
they're never gonna
answer that question.

207
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,312
So could Kapersky or
some other third party

208
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,048
anti-virus type solution,
potentially Russian based

209
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,918
have pulled back
some of those files,

210
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,520
by hitting indicators
of compromise there.

211
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,756
So kind of looking
at the Shadow Brokers

212
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,424
and the background here,

213
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,226
I was actually on an
incident response gig

214
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,761
when the first piece got leaked,

215
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,930
and I'll be honest, when I
saw that out in the media,

216
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,000
I was immediately concerned,
like I think everybody was.

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,502
And as soon as it
started emerging

218
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:52,939
what was in some of those
tools and exploits there

219
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,608
that were originally
leaked on August 13,

220
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:58,511
we saw some immediate
exploitation worldwide

221
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,912
of some Cisco routers,

222
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,382
well Cisco routers and
firewalls specifically.

223
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,184
But with SNMP deployed

224
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:08,988
that was certainly
a bad month for us.

225
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,456
We working one incident response

226
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,991
and that turned into lots
of incident responses,

227
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:16,796
many of those fueled by that.
I have to say by the way,

228
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,098
as much as dislike
the Shadow Brokers,

229
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,100
and I really do dislike
the Shadow Brokers,

230
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,736
they have been great for the
incident response community,

231
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,639
because for the first
time folks or everybody

232
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,408
has access to nation
state level tools

233
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,277
and it is really upping the game

234
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,913
and we are seeing, I
would say the majority

235
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:37,116
of our incident responses
over the last year

236
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:40,553
have included some use of
the EternalBlue exploit

237
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:42,087
somewhere in the network.

238
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,256
Oftentimes it's one of the
ways that they pushed in.

239
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:45,491
Definitely once they're in,

240
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,460
they're finding
machines, MS17-010

241
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,595
to go back and knock down.

242
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,864
So again, I'm not gonna
thank the Shadow Brokers

243
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,699
for leaking all this stuff,
I certainly won't say that,

244
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,867
but I have to find a silver
lining in a given cloud,

245
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,236
it is definitely that they have

246
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,471
upped the incident response game

247
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,873
and I think overall,
not to be cynical,

248
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,543
I think overall this is
raising the bar for security.

249
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,344
Again, as we have so many folks

250
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,980
that have access to these tools,

251
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,049
what we're seeing then
is a lot of other folks

252
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,018
stepping back and re-evaluating
their threat models

253
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,654
and basically coming in
and increasing security

254
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,155
around their stuff.

255
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,058
So we a list of infrastructure
servers come out in October.

256
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,460
In January we've got a
list of Windows exploits

257
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,895
and a few tools.

258
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,964
They release 60 some odd tools.

259
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,632
One of those was
really interesting.

260
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,233
We'll talk about it
here a little bit later.

261
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,703
It was something
called event log edit,

262
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,238
which was kind of interesting,

263
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,707
because for a long time we've
had a lotta assumptions about

264
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,609
what we could and couldn't
do with event logs.

265
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,210
We could clear 'em,
but we couldn't go in

266
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,181
and start surgically removing
entries in event logs.

267
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,451
And then in, around April fifth,

268
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,354
Linux tools, there's a bunch
of Linux stuff that came out

269
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,488
and a couple exploits.

270
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,591
And that was pretty cool

271
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,392
and I actually wrote a
blog post about this.

272
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,594
I hadn't been completely silent

273
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,028
about the Shadow Brokers thing.

274
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,598
They were threatening a
couple of folks here and there

275
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,900
and threatening more
release and more release.

276
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,136
And when they did
this, with April fifth,

277
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,871
there was some other stuff
kicking around in the world

278
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,106
and of course you
can go Google that,

279
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,774
I'm not gonna get
political here,

280
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,444
but it certainly looked like,
from a timing perspective,

281
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,079
that this was a response to,

282
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,782
largely a media headline
kinda grabbing thing.

283
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,418
And I was actually
down at SANS Orlando,

284
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,487
we were getting ready to
kickoff SANS Orlando there

285
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,289
and I think it was day two,
day three, something like that.

286
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,625
I went to sleep after having
written that blog post.

287
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,893
It got syndicated a
few places and whatnot

288
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,229
and I woke up and I
pulled out my phone

289
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,431
and I look and there's little
Twitter notification thing,

290
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,333
and it taps out on
the Twitter app at 99.

291
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,235
It says 99 plus.

292
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,804
And I open that and then I
see that I've been called out

293
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,208
by well what is likely to be
a hostile nation state here,

294
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,209
the Shadow Brokers.

295
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,709
So my phone is at this point,

296
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,045
not only do I have
the Twitter hits,

297
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,314
I've got dozen signal messages,

298
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,251
I've got missed calls from
two people I work with,

299
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,487
I've got several missed
calls from my PR guy,

300
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,223
who is like losing
his stuff from,

301
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,458
well 'cause I mean he's
gettin' called too.

302
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,660
He does PR for my company

303
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,461
and so I'm like (sighs)
oh this is not good.

304
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,064
So anyway, that made for an

305
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,498
interesting
conference, definitely.

306
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,501
I was actually
teaching 760 out there,

307
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,770
exploit, or Advanced
Exploit Development.

308
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,238
So this worked in really well,

309
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,339
the fact that they had
dumped a bunch of exploits

310
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,674
that we could also look at.

311
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,975
That was cool.

312
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,710
But that said as
we start looking

313
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,111
at these Windows exploits,

314
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,613
of course you know the
history here with EternalBlue,

315
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,915
I'm not gonna walk through
the WannaCry, NotPetya,

316
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,483
and the dozens of other places

317
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,285
that MS17-010 has
been included in.

318
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,220
But I do wanna talk about the

319
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,588
DFIR implications of the dumps.

320
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,790
And look, this is the,

321
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,224
if you take nothing else
away from this talk,

322
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,428
this is really where it's at.

323
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,763
We're at a digital
forensics conference anyway,

324
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,967
so certainly this makes
for some apt discussions.

325
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,005
I wanna talk about a
couple a notes here.

326
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,174
I don't wanna talk about
how the Equation Group

327
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,076
may or may not have used the
tools we're gonna discuss,

328
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,178
because I think
that's probably not

329
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,246
a rocket science move there.

330
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,514
I think that leaves me

331
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,416
and little bracelets
at the back here.

332
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,852
But I do wanna
highlight capabilities

333
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,353
that have been released

334
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,921
and everyone of these
are capabilities

335
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,691
that other people have
talked about publicly

336
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,359
and inside the dumps.

337
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,595
And I wanna talk about
how this should force us

338
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,797
to fundamentally
change what we believe

339
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,532
to be both in the
realm of the possible

340
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,534
and the realm of the
reasonably likely.

341
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,002
Because when folks come out

342
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,304
and they say what's in
the realm of the possible,

343
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,040
yesterday somebody
asked Nichole Ibrahim

344
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,044
who did the awesome event
trace logging ETL stuff,

345
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,779
they asked, hey could
somebody edit that stuff?

346
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,849
And in the back I'm
thinking, wow, come on man,

347
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,550
of course they can, right?

348
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,752
But then again, I'm thinking

349
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,286
now that's in the
realm of the possible.

350
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,888
What's in the realm of
the reasonably likely?

351
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,224
Would an attacker do that?

352
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,593
And secondarily, if they did it,

353
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,728
what forensic traces
would it leave?

354
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,164
So as we start talking
about this stuff here,

355
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,399
I wanna highlight that again,

356
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,801
we're just looking
at capabilities.

357
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,803
Now from a should you do this,

358
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,538
should you be analyzing leaks,

359
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,173
obviously if you work
government stuff,

360
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,010
this is, eh, right a little
third rail kinda stuff, right?

361
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,079
I wanna come back and tell you

362
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,781
that we have seen already,

363
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,983
it took two months,
not EternalBlue,

364
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,484
took too months for the
actual event log editing code

365
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,187
to start showing up in malware.

366
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,488
I'm sure it happened
quicker than that,

367
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:12,024
we just saw the first
sample two months in.

368
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,360
And you can go in and I
can use aura signature

369
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,429
and I can look at specifically
the list of API calls made

370
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,664
and the way that they're made,

371
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,499
and it is the code.

372
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,002
So two months is what it took.

373
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,502
So as we step back here,

374
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,971
if you're not looking
at this stuff,

375
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,407
let me go ahead and tell
you that your attackers are,

376
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,909
your adversaries are.

377
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,310
And the interesting thing is,

378
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,179
most digital forensics
professionals that I talk to,

379
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,579
most Infosec professionals,

380
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,415
they wanna look at these dumps

381
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,651
and the people tellin'
not to, it's the bosses.

382
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,720
And they irony is,
it's always the boss,

383
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,956
it's always the manager
who comes in and is like,

384
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,325
it's APT that's attacking us.

385
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,627
And I'm like, yes,
absolutely they're advanced,

386
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,061
they're advanced
persistent threat.

387
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,463
I always like when
somebody says APT,

388
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,497
to say what does that stand for?

389
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,599
And often times they don't know.

390
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,134
That's the cool part.

391
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,602
But I like to come back then
and break it down for 'em

392
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,338
and say APT, I'd like
to walk 'em through that

393
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,406
and here I wanna focus on the A,

394
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,476
the advanced piece, because
I wanna ask the question,

395
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,478
do you think your
attackers are so advanced

396
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,180
that they're compromising
your network,

397
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,181
but they're also
not advanced enough

398
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,185
to download a dump from the
internet and analyze it?

399
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,420
And if they know about these
capabilities shouldn't you?

400
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,989
And they're like, well, ha ha,

401
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,858
armed with that logic
I can tell you nothing

402
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,559
but don't look at the dumps.

403
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,392
Wait, what?

404
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,828
No, right?

405
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,262
So again as we start
talking about this stuff,

406
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,265
it is important for you to
understand the the capabilities.

407
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,400
Between this and
the Vault7 dumps

408
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,403
every nation state attack
group on the planet

409
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,338
is looking at these,

410
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,973
and they're leaps and bounds,

411
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,809
they're learning from 10 to
hundreds of millions of dollars

412
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,078
in research paid
for, presumably,

413
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,512
again not gonna confirm
or deny anything,

414
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,015
but paid for presumably
with your tax dollars.

415
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,018
You should absolutely
be benefit from this.

416
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:47,453
So I wanna talk about
five DFIR implications

417
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,688
and there are way
more than this.

418
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,957
I would ask by show a
hands how many people

419
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,492
have actually
analyzed the dumps,

420
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,828
but I totally don't wanna put
any of you in a bad position,

421
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,030
either for raising your hand
or not raising your hand.

422
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,366
But I'm gonna tell you that
there's a ton more in this

423
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,034
that folks have
talked about publicly.

424
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,936
Again I wanna focus
on these five.

425
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,405
Threat hunting the
Equation Group actors

426
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,707
and Equation Group is
the Kaspersky name for

427
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,543
what was released in the
Shadow Brokers dumps.

428
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,012
The disable auditing piece.

429
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,948
I wanna talk about event
log editing, hacking Oracle,

430
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,651
and then threat hunting
other actors in networks.

431
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,420
So threat hunting
Equation Group.

432
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,623
This is one where I would
step back as we talk about

433
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:27,326
and start talking about the
(clears throat) excuse me,

434
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,362
start talking about
our courses of action

435
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,630
in threat intelligence

436
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,064
or course of action
incidence response.

437
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,900
We talk about both
detection and discovery.

438
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,803
Detection is basically
getting a signature

439
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,005
and dropping that signature
in let's say on your IDS

440
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,774
and waiting for a hit.

441
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,942
And then there's discovery,

442
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,710
and that's post-hoc
signature use.

443
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,313
That's the we didn't know
this IP address was bad

444
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,715
or compromised yesterday,

445
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,750
when we actually had
a connection to it,

446
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,218
but can I go back in my logs,

447
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,187
can I go back on my
Netflow, my pcap?

448
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,123
What about tool
signatures, filenames,

449
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,259
registry keys, service names?

450
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,760
And I know a lotta
folks are like,

451
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,729
yeah, but totally they would
have cleaned that stuff up

452
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,097
once they knew it
was compromised.

453
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,366
And I have to say, maybe.

454
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,234
But I tell you, when we're
doin' incident response

455
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,370
we find machines where
somebody's pulled a

456
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,572
hard drive out of a
machine for e-discovery

457
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,474
or litigation reasons

458
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,477
or some box buried
in the back somewhere

459
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,313
and if it was off, nobody
could touch that right?

460
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,247
So there's a possibility
that there's stuff there

461
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,351
and we find threat
actors in some of those

462
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,585
weird machines there,

463
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,520
applying stuff we
know about today

464
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,722
that they wouldn't have known

465
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:30,622
when they pulled the
drive out of the machine

466
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,890
three years ago.

467
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,824
Somebody wouldn't have
known to look for it.

468
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,759
Even though they've analyzed it,

469
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,427
again, we have new data today.

470
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,296
And again, the
Equation Group stuff,

471
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,764
again, you have new data today.

472
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,265
Now I hope the majority of
the folks sitting in the room

473
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:41,967
today were not targets
of the Equation Group,

474
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,203
but, I mean, who knows right?

475
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,307
Oh by the way before
we leave that,

476
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,109
it's not just the Equation
Group at this point,

477
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,543
now everybody has the tools.

478
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,412
So I'll just throw
that one out there too.

479
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,680
Certainly it might make it worth

480
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,314
looking for that as well.

481
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:57,783
We'll talk about
disabling auditing

482
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,219
'cause this is where stuff
actually starts getting sexy.

483
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,554
Traditionally we've been told
that if you turn event log,

484
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,723
or sorry event auditing off,

485
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,892
there's always gonna be
an audit change record

486
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,494
in the event log itself.

487
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:11,763
And we know that from their
own documentation no less,

488
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,800
we know that attackers
can disable event logging

489
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,169
and presumably this doesn't
leave any additional audit logs

490
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,305
and I can tell you from having
reverse engineered the code,

491
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,608
that is absolutely the case.

492
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,109
I do a little bit of reverse
engineering here and there.

493
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,512
Turns out that these
guys actually jump into,

494
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:29,048
and this was
released in January,

495
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,151
and again we first saw it
operationalized in March.

496
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,519
What was happening
here effectively,

497
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,722
is that these guys
are jumping into the,

498
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,491
basically jumping into
the LSASS process,

499
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,393
injecting into
the LSASS process.

500
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,295
They're hunting down
a specific thread

501
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,563
that does event logging.

502
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,032
And I mean I gotta fist
bump the attackers here.

503
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,867
The developer that
came up with this,

504
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,637
it's both simplistic
and it's amazing,

505
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,038
because they stepped
back and they said,

506
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,740
okay, look, we're
gonna go into memory,

507
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,176
and we're gonna find of
all the threads in LSASS

508
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,342
and there are a lot.

509
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,312
If not sure pop up
Process Hacker sometime

510
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,312
and look at the
threads in LSASS.

511
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:04,149
That's a busy freakin' process.

512
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,252
And so they got these
threads all goin' in LSASS,

513
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,389
they hunt down the specific
thread that does event logging

514
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,255
and they just suspend it.

515
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,891
And that's it.

516
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,027
So happily your event
logging doesn't do anything.

517
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,628
It doesn't know that
it's been suspended.

518
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,129
By the way, cool fact,

519
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,199
turns out messages don't
queue up on the backside.

520
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,468
So all the event logging
that was supposed to happen

521
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,635
it all falls on the floor

522
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,270
and eventually
they just unsuspend

523
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,139
and resume the thread when
they're done, and go, go, go.

524
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,740
And I'd love to tell
you this is a new thing,

525
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,776
but I think it's not,

526
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,345
because the script that
they use to deploy the .dll

527
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,216
shows that it was
created in '01.

528
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,486
I checked my watch this
morning, it's 2018.

529
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,756
So people have had
this for a long time.

530
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,025
As a matter of fact, I have to
throw something at Rob here,

531
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,562
because I was sold a bag
of lies when I took 508

532
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,097
and we started talking about,

533
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,600
and I'm rolling back
here six or seven years.

534
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,435
I mean Rob, what the heck man?

535
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,403
Anyway I was told that
event logging, right,

536
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,272
event logging if
they turned it off,

537
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,807
we'd absolutely see
an event record there

538
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,143
and no such event record
apparently exists.

539
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,111
So again, and I'm not
picking on Rob, here,

540
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,580
obviously this is like full
nation state capability.

541
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,349
And we've seen other
folks start to go in

542
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,783
and delete logs before.

543
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,918
I've never seen this
capability anywhere else.

544
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,354
So to start reverse engineering,

545
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,622
this is something to
start thinking about,

546
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,724
because I depend on event logs.

547
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,960
And today the game's
changed a little bit,

548
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,129
where I'm really having to
step back and start doing,

549
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,731
and I'll talk more
about this in a minute,

550
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,766
hunting the negative space.

551
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,169
Because as I start hunting
the negative space,

552
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,104
I've gotta ask, what
should be there?

553
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,906
Based on all the
stuff that I know,

554
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,941
whether it's ETL,
whether it's prefetch,

555
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,676
whether it's Shimcache, Amcache,

556
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,378
other evidence of execution,

557
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,980
based on what I
know must be there,

558
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,316
what isn't in the event log?

559
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,717
Before I used to
open up the event log

560
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,520
and I'm like, hey,
what's in the event log?

561
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,689
Now I've gotta ask myself
what's in the event log,

562
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,158
and what's not in the event log?

563
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,526
And what's not in the
event log is possibly,

564
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,430
and in many cases,
every bit as important

565
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,765
as what actually is.

566
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,300
So we find out, not
only can the attacker

567
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,101
suspend the event log
or suspend auditing,

568
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,305
they can also surgically
edit event records.

569
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,440
So presumably this
is the kinda thing

570
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,642
where before you got
on the box to inject

571
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,711
or before you
elevated or whatever

572
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,647
a privilege escalated
to get into LSASS

573
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,983
again what logs did
you leave there?

574
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,451
Now we had some
evidence previously

575
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,254
that a couple of APT
groups had this capability.

576
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,921
Normally again we
would find this,

577
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,857
not by looking at the tools,

578
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,726
because usually they
had great offsec

579
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,661
and they took their
tools with them,

580
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,896
didn't leave 'em on disk here

581
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,531
and they did usually
secure the leads.

582
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,300
But we would see stuff,
like for instance a 4625,

583
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,202
with no 4624.

584
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,204
Or if process auditing was on,

585
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,606
we would see the
actual session ID

586
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,407
and there was no
logon session ID.

587
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,908
And I love those.

588
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,344
That's one of those, and
again I know at that point,

589
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,612
that I've got an attacker

590
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,946
who has an event log
editing capability

591
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,581
but also doesn't know
how event logging works

592
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,150
or has a partial
understanding of it,

593
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,486
'cause they're like let me
go ahead and nuke my logon.

594
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,288
And I'm like cool, right,
but you totally screwed up

595
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,956
nuking your logoff.

596
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,091
And the fact that you have
a logoff with no logon,

597
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,960
certainly is super suspicious.

598
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,929
So again, what we're
looking here is,

599
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,497
or looking, basically we'll call

600
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,798
hunting that negative space.

601
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,701
We're looking at
what must be here.

602
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,904
I talked to an engineer
several years ago,

603
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,806
it's probably actually
a decade and a half ago,

604
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,174
and he's one of those folks

605
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,512
that made one of these
generation leaps in technology.

606
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,679
And I won't get into what it is,

607
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,914
'cause it doesn't
really matter for this,

608
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:24,316
but he talked to me a
lot and taught me about

609
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,318
hunting the negative space.

610
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,620
And he was talking about,
while everybody else,

611
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,188
he said he made his big
breakthrough actually at the,

612
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:32,791
what do they call that,

613
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,592
the big pool up there
in Washington, D.C.,

614
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,162
right in front of the
Washington Monument,

615
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,430
the Reflecting Pool.

616
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,665
He was at the Reflecting Pool

617
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,332
and he said there
was some ducks there

618
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,534
and he said he was
watching the ducks,

619
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,269
he was watching
people feed the ducks,

620
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,470
and he said the ducks
that were looking

621
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,705
for the bread hittin' the water,

622
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,673
never got the bread.

623
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,743
He said if the duck had
to wait to see the bread,

624
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,278
see the bread hitting the water,

625
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,013
he said they never
got the bread.

626
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,380
He said he was
watching the ducks,

627
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,283
and he said every time
bread hit the water,

628
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,319
it caused a little ripple.

629
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,920
And he said the ducks
would immediately,

630
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,589
he said that smart ducks
would immediately dive

631
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,457
'cause they weren't
looking for the bread,

632
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,361
they were looking for what
was caused by the bread,

633
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,296
and that was that little
disruption in the water

634
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,332
and they were triangulating
based on the disruptions

635
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,334
to go figure out where
the bread had hit.

636
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,902
That's one of those spots
where you gotta step back

637
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,637
and go first off, this
guy's clearly playing

638
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,339
Beautiful Mind home
edition, right?

639
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,742
But secondarily, this
hunting the negative space

640
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,010
it's a really interesting piece,

641
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,812
and we can certainly
use it for forensics,

642
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,879
and more aptly for
anti-forensics.

643
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,048
This is another big one for me,

644
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,717
because a lotta
folks are doing table

645
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,051
and column level encryption

646
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,387
and we regularly
have this fight with,

647
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,922
and I say fight, this argument

648
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,856
when we start doing red teaming,

649
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,291
we get onto a database server

650
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,293
and we're SYSTEM
level permissions,

651
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,928
and folks say hey,

652
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,463
did you actually steal the data?

653
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,565
And we're like no, because
it's a production database

654
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,933
and we don't have
the credentials.

655
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,201
We're SYSTEM level,

656
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,769
but we don't actually
have the login,

657
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,371
for instance the Oracle login,

658
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,239
we don't have that Oracle
login, right is that cool?

659
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,074
And they're like, I'm not
gonna go start injecting

660
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,876
into somebody's production
Oracle database server,

661
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,144
for obvious reasons.

662
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,480
I don't wanna cause
an availability issue.

663
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,614
People are like,
well then I guess

664
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,548
you could really get into it.

665
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,783
I'm like no, no, we're SYSTEM,

666
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,818
we totally could if we
engineered the tools

667
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,787
and it turns out somebody did.

668
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,956
So there was actually tool built
in the Shadow Brokers dumps

669
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,858
or a tool that's in the
Shadow Brokers dumps.

670
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,658
Matt Suiche who stood me up here

671
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,695
talked about this at
Blackhat last year.

672
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,896
You can go download his video.

673
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,364
He talked a lot
about this actually,

674
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:22,100
because it's involved
heavily in the Swift dumps

675
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,034
that were talked about there.

676
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,471
There's no logging,
bypasses any of that table

677
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,274
and column level encryption
because you are the database.

678
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,876
So as long as the
database has the keys

679
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,511
you're good to go.

680
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,879
As long as that database process

681
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,246
and that's kind
the way the column

682
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,115
and table level
encryption normally work.

683
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,551
Even if yours is in a hardware
security module in HSM

684
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,653
it's usually the database
that makes the call to HSM

685
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,021
so game on.

686
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,222
So again, we kinda
step back here

687
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,857
and look at this as
yet another capability.

688
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,893
And by the way again,
dive into these dumps,

689
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,494
'cause there's a ton
of other stuff in there

690
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,295
that folks have pulled out.

691
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,497
But I think the most
interesting part

692
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,367
is threat hunting other
nation state actors.

693
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,569
Hungarian researchers
disclosed earlier this year

694
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,504
that there was a program
or a set of files

695
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,175
that they called
Territorial Dispute

696
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,876
and they talk about
enabling the Equation Group

697
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,579
to go hunt for other
nation state actors.

698
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,947
Meaning, in the
Shadow Brokers dumps,

699
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,483
there are a bunch of IOCs

700
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:14,252
that the Shadow Brokers, or
sorry, not the Shadow Brokers,

701
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,321
excuse the Equation Group
themselves had built,

702
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,889
to go detect their adversaries.

703
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,658
Right, so counterintelligence.

704
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,626
And largely, we're
not using this.

705
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,061
In fact, it took almost a year,

706
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,362
I think it was
March of this year,

707
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:26,765
and the dump was created,

708
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,434
or dump was released
April of last year,

709
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,570
so we're looking
at 11 months-ish,

710
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,705
between the time that the
dump was publicly available

711
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,939
and somebody called this out.

712
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,274
I have no doubt that
other folks found this

713
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,508
without reporting on it.

714
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,010
But what you have
now effectively

715
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,013
is a ton of government
IOCs, government built

716
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,747
indicators of compromise,

717
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,683
to target other groups.

718
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,184
The really cool part is,

719
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,921
we can confirm, based on some
publicly known IOCs already,

720
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,190
we can confirm that some
of those IOCs match up

721
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,992
with a couple of nation
state threat groups,

722
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,728
and so you can infer that
the rest of them also do,

723
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,897
we just didn't know about it.

724
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,698
So free beer, right?

725
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,537
I'll talk quickly about kind
of living in the shadows

726
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,072
of that disclosure,

727
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,573
because there was lot here
that I really didn't know

728
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,343
how this was all gonna play out.

729
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,411
I'll tell you that if you'd
asked me prior to April

730
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,646
what I thought was gonna happen

731
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,481
if for instance say
Russian Intelligence,

732
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,384
sorry, excuse me, a
hostile nation, no,

733
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,987
a anonymous group that's
dumping stuff on the internet,

734
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,622
if you asked me what
was gonna happen

735
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,190
when they did that and
when they called you out

736
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,458
as a former NSA hacker,

737
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:31,263
and a caveat here, also
spoke in a enough code,

738
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,197
we'll say for me to kind of a,

739
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,401
hey we know and we wanna
make sure that you know

740
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,403
that we know kinda thing,

741
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,239
if you'd asked me how I thought
that was gonna play out,

742
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,408
I absolutely thought, and
in fact notified SANS,

743
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,110
I said it will not surprise
me, 'cause I'm teaching right,

744
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,646
it will not surprise if
the FBI shows up here,

745
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,115
and pulls me in for questioning

746
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,316
and the whole whatever.

747
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,018
I just, I don't know
how it's gonna play out.

748
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,921
Or yeah, who knows?

749
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,189
My threat model absolutely
changed overnight.

750
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,826
I will tell you that if you're
working in government today

751
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,929
understand your threat
model because I'll tell you,

752
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,530
absolutely I did not.

753
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,666
Nothing stays secret forever.

754
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,235
Between different
organizations I spent,

755
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,307
gosh almost two decades
in intelligence.

756
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,475
And today what's
changing is that

757
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,177
intelligence community
leaks and compromises

758
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,579
are absolutely rampant.

759
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,414
Before you do it,
whatever it is,

760
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,848
think about how that would look

761
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,450
if your actions are
suddenly on the front page

762
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,852
of the New York
Times, for instance.

763
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,057
So, by the way, that was
an absolutely wild event.

764
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,325
The New York Times came down

765
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,093
and they wanted to talk
about the Shadow Brokers

766
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,428
a little bit and they
wanted to cover it

767
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,530
from the perspective of again,

768
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,331
take a little bit of a look at,

769
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,002
what was it like
after getting outed.

770
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:44,936
And that was kinda interesting.

771
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,303
And they actually ran the story,

772
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,306
this is another SANS
summit actually,

773
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,609
the Hackfest last year.

774
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,544
And they ran the story in
digital form on Sunday,

775
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,913
and of course again
Twitter mentions

776
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,414
blowing up and everything

777
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,316
and I didn't think it was
gonna go in print at all

778
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,385
and I walked in
Starbucks Monday morning,

779
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,754
and of course,
Starbucks in D.C. there

780
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,923
has all the papers,
the major papers there,

781
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,292
and I look and I'm
on the front page

782
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,959
above the fold of
the New York Times.

783
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,528
So my photos there
and I'm like oh wow,

784
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:11,796
okay that's interesting

785
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,531
and how do you not buy
one of those, I guess?

786
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,966
So I go ahead and I grab a paper

787
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,167
and put it down
there with my coffee

788
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,403
and the barista
who's ringing it up

789
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:21,573
looks down, looks up,
looks down, looks up,

790
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:22,574
she's like that's you.

791
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,908
I'm like, it is.

792
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,142
She's like what'd you do?

793
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,946
I'm like, never mind,
just ring up the coffee,

794
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,047
we'll just roll there.

795
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:31,983
But that was truly a
surreal experience.

796
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
So and I hope it
never happens again.

797
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,989
From a threat model standpoint,

798
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,491
and understanding
your threat model,

799
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,860
I assumed that what I did
was never gonna be detected,

800
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,195
because well, we're
pretty good at that.

801
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,798
If it was detected
it wouldn't have been

802
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,899
attributed to the U.S.

803
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,835
And if it was
attributed to the U.S.,

804
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,837
it wasn't gonna be
attributed to me.

805
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,074
And I'm positive that none
of those are true now.

806
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,709
I'm positive that none
of those are true now.

807
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,844
I've already restricted
a lot of my travel,

808
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,880
a lot of my travel,

809
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,616
and I expect that
I will continue to

810
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,085
restrict quite a bit. And by
the way, it's not just about

811
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,319
where you're traveling to,

812
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,553
it's where you're
connecting through.

813
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,089
That's certainly a concern.

814
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,725
And I'll tell you another
one that hit me last year,

815
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,226
and I'll leave some
of the countries out,

816
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,294
'cause it doesn't really matter,

817
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,563
it's where you're flying over.

818
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,031
Because we had one of those,

819
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,700
we'll say a little engine issue.

820
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,268
You've ever been on a plane,

821
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,370
you're 35,000 feet flying along

822
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,705
and all of a sudden
you hear that

823
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,306
(imitates metal
clanking together).

824
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:29,140
And you know when
you hit 10,000 feet

825
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,975
they do the ding, ding.

826
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,409
There's a three ding one

827
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,647
and that's the flight attendants
prepare for an emergency.

828
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,183
And they did the
ding, ding, ding,

829
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,819
and I'm like oh, and at my
inflight entertainment system

830
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,289
I look over at the
map and I'm like, oh,

831
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,456
well that's gonna suck.

832
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,159
'Cause then I'm looking
at very seriously,

833
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,528
if we land, do I take back off?

834
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,897
I have since started looking.

835
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,432
I know more about flight routes

836
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,935
I bet than any non-pilot or
non-airline industry person.

837
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,536
I travel internationally a lot.

838
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,138
I know a lot about flight
routes at this point

839
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:01,572
and I'll just leave it there,

840
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,807
'cause there's countries
that I won't fly over either.

841
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,242
We didn't land thankfully,

842
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,144
it was one of those,
they're like, whew,

843
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:07,645
everything's good now,

844
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,047
and the seatbelt sign went on
and eventually we were good.

845
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,982
But again, this is one
of these pieces here,

846
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,350
is you're doing this work,

847
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,686
if you're in this kinda field,

848
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,621
I would say stop assuming,
like I did originally,

849
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,759
that again, stuff's never
gonna be attributed to you.

850
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,026
I am positive the Shadow Brokers

851
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,696
have a heck of a lot
more data than they,

852
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,363
a heck of a lot more data that
they have already released.

853
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm positive that they can
tie specific operations

854
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,101
back to me.

855
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,603
I have zero doubt in my
mind that they can do that

856
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,671
and that's gonna be a
really, really bad day

857
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:35,073
when that happens,

858
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,942
especially with the DOJ
charging other foreign hackers.

859
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,145
What goes around come around.

860
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:43,648
So again, I mentioned some
changing of travel plans.

861
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,617
Shadow Brokers got
really, really made at me

862
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,485
in July 2017.

863
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,420
They actually called out
another NSA professional

864
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:51,723
who they thought
was harassing them,

865
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,524
or ex-NSA professional
who they thought

866
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,226
was harassing them on Twitter.

867
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,163
It turns out they
totally got it wrong.

868
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,198
So the guy shared a
name, the Twitter handle,

869
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,634
right shared a name with
somebody who was actually

870
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,070
an ex-NSA hacker

871
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,374
and the guy who was
behind the Twitter account

872
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,575
actually came and
out said hey brother,

873
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:11,776
you're totally wrong.

874
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,411
How do you know,
'cause I'm this guy,

875
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,113
and he totally pinned
the wrong people.

876
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,481
And then as a cover move,

877
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,082
they basically tore
into me and Matt again.

878
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,350
So that was awesome.

879
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,752
They came right back
and they were we knew

880
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,321
the whole time you
weren't that guy,

881
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,523
but you know who
we got right, Jake.

882
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,524
And I'm like really? Thanks.

883
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,027
So that sucked.

884
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,662
So I actually had
to cancel a couple

885
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,263
of overseas engagements,
'cause again,

886
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,732
there's the what you
know they've released,

887
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,668
and then there's the stuff
that you know you did,

888
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,402
but you don't know that
they've released that

889
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,205
to other governments
and you can imagine.

890
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:42,372
Anyway, it's a heck of a
lot harder to understand

891
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,075
the treat of a
disclosure made privately

892
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,944
to a foreign government.

893
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,312
I think that's all
the time I got.

894
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,580
I appreciate everybody here,

895
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,149
definitely for
listening to this.

896
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,318
And I hope, if you take
nothing else away man,

897
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,452
it's the dumps.

898
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,620
You gotta look at these dumps,

899
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,988
'cause your attackers
are too, 100%

900
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,224
and they are
repurposing these tools

901
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,925
at an amazing rate
and you're absolutely

902
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,159
gonna see these
in your networks.

903
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,995
We saw the event log
editing capability used

904
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,729
in a university network,

905
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,333
where a student hacked the
network and edited event logs.

906
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,500
Forget nation states man,

907
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,002
we're talkin'
undergrad students.

908
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,270
Anyway, thanks.

909
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,138
(audience applauds)

910
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,140
(suspenseful music)
