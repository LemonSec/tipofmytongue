1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,902
(electronic music)

2
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,278
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,681
- Welcome, Heather and I are
teaming up again this year

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,849
if you saw our
presentation last year.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,552
This time we're doing
DFIRfit or bust.

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,054
We got a hashtag in there.

7
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,323
We're not quite millennials,
but we do like our hash tags.

8
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,726
That's right, we got
matching goin' on here too.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,232
A little bit about what
the heck is DFIRfit?

10
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,667
DFIRfit kind of has
its originations

11
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,003
in this conference last year.

12
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,541
We can either blame or high
five forensics woman Stacy,

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,510
so, if you see her
around, she's the one

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,945
who really came up
with the hashtag.

15
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:49,215
So, it's kind of one of those
things that we've taken on

16
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,785
in the past year or so to try
to get off our butts to try

17
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,120
to actually get out from not
in front of the computer,

18
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,857
as we usually are every single
day, every single night,

19
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,659
and actually start
doin' some exercise,

20
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,495
trying to get out of
there either for sanity,

21
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,698
for health reasons,
for whatever purpose.

22
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,767
So, we're gonna talk
a little bit about

23
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,336
the technical aspects of
the IOS health database,

24
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,905
as well as givin'
you a little bit

25
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,441
of motivation to
do it yourselves.

26
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,209
We're gonna get into some
acquisition and analysis

27
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,112
of this health data and
try to motivate you.

28
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,982
A little bit about
us and our goals.

29
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,619
About a year ago,
Heather, Phil, Rob,

30
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,154
we're all talking about
this Orange Theory thing.

31
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,223
I'm like, what the heck is
this Orange Theory thing?

32
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,359
It's got a weird name to
it, and they were tryin'

33
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,128
to get me to do this
early in the morning.

34
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,430
I do not do early mornings.

35
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,898
I very much like to sleep.

36
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:41,734
I also don't particularly
like to exercise,

37
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,770
but I went home from the summit.

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,271
I really needed to get off
my butt and to exercise.

39
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,675
I just changed commute
location, so I had

40
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,643
an extra hour of the
day, so I really wanted

41
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,046
to spend that time
getting to the gym

42
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,515
and trying to be a
little bit healthier,

43
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,183
so I did this whole
Orange Theory thing,

44
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,652
and it's kind of worked
out for me, so that's

45
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,255
what I spent my last year
or so kind of working on,

46
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,824
also collecting data
because why not?

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,827
- Those of you who
remember last year,

48
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,596
I had a really
little baby with me

49
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,631
and still some baby
weight clinging on,

50
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,267
so that's honestly why
I joined Orange Theory,

51
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,302
or as Rob's wife
calls it, the cult.

52
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,037
It's really not a cult.

53
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,440
I think CrossFit is the cult.

54
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,377
Everyone has their own
opinions, but I hate running.

55
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,681
I honestly, Rob wants us to
do this Disney half marathon,

56
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,217
and I think I would rather
cut off some fingers

57
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,486
than do that, and I don't.

58
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,923
You can see, I prefer
walking, so I do my steps,

59
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,258
try to walk as far as possible,

60
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,393
but I needed something
to put me over the hump

61
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,263
of getting the baby
weight to finally go away,

62
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,798
so that was the motivation
behind some of my stuff.

63
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,400
Acquisition, so we're
gonna start with

64
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,104
how do we even get
this health data?

65
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,872
Sarah and I tried a
little bit of everything,

66
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,407
and to keep it fair,

67
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,343
we looked at jailbroken
and nonjailbroken devices.

68
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,846
The good news is all the data
that we received was the same,

69
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,315
so you don't have to jailbreak

70
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,285
to get what you're seeing
in our data sets here.

71
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,820
If you use commercial
forensic tools,

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,590
as long as your tool
encrypts the backup,

73
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,493
you will get the data, so you
don't have to really stress.

74
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,195
I personally did iTunes.

75
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,363
I just used iTunes,
encrypted my backup,

76
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,965
and looked at the data that way.

77
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,000
I believe you did the same.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,771
With iCloud, which we're going
to hit on here in a minute,

79
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,839
iCloud, you can see in that
screenshot right there,

80
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:31,744
I have it set to put my
health data in iCloud.

81
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,214
When you go to load
your data into iCloud,

82
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,517
there's not the option to
encrypt or not encrypt.

83
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,887
The data is just there and
stored by Apple in iCloud.

84
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,489
None of the methods I used
to pull down my iCloud data,

85
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,593
or Sarah's iCloud data, had
our health database in it,

86
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,761
so we can't confirm
at this point

87
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,497
if it's the exact same files
or not, but we assume it is,

88
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,067
and we'll hit on that
a little bit later.

89
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,071
With simple exports, say
you just have a device,

90
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,340
and you do not have
access to a backup,

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,741
or you can't create a backup,

92
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,710
you can actually export
out the health data,

93
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,478
which you see in
Sarah's picture there,

94
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,815
where you can choose export
health, and it looks like this.

95
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,683
So, if you're okay
with looking at this,

96
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,319
and your eyes are
crossing, it's fine.

97
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,054
You could write a
script that parses this,

98
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,523
and ultimately that's kind
of what we wanted to do,

99
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,159
but we ran out of time,
but there are easier ways

100
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,995
to do that, and that's what
we're going to show you,

101
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,430
but this export does
contain everything

102
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,933
that we're going to cover
in the slides coming up.

103
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,337
- A little bit about
what we're taking out

104
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,905
from this particular
presentation.

105
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,708
We're really gonna focus on
the native health database.

106
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,211
There's two applications.

107
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,280
There's the health app, and
there's the activity app.

108
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,515
They both use the same
database on the backend,

109
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,816
but if you have an IOS device,

110
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,885
you have two separate
applications,

111
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,788
and I'll show you some screen
shots in the next slide.

112
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,356
Another thing to keep
in mind, if you have

113
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,959
third party applications,
you often get the option

114
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,095
to allow access to
the health database.

115
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,730
It's in your permissions.

116
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,867
If you do like a Couch
to 5K or the MyFitnessPal

117
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,570
for dietary things, a lot
of that data can be pushed

118
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,141
into the health database as
well, so you might be looking

119
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,176
at the IOS health data,
but you also wanna, maybe,

120
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,846
take a look at third party
applications as well.

121
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,581
Sometimes they do push
that data in there.

122
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:19,118
Sometimes they don't, so
just be aware of that.

123
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,787
We're also going to
be talking quite a bit

124
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,822
about the heart
rate stuff today.

125
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,591
So, we're primarily gonna be
talking about the Apple Watch.

126
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,960
We both have Apple Watches,
so a lot of the data

127
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,496
that we populated
for this presentation

128
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,897
came from our own data sets,

129
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,667
came from our own Apple
Watches, but it's worth noting,

130
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,337
if you have other
devices, Fitbits

131
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,707
and nonApple-based devices,
a lot of that data could

132
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,077
also potentially be pushed
into the health application.

133
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,546
It's just really up
to the device itself.

134
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,515
A couple of screenshots here.

135
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,782
These are the two applications

136
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,685
that we're primarily
gonna be talking about.

137
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,821
Generally speaking,
if you see the data

138
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,156
in these particular
applications,

139
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,891
you can pull that
out in the database.

140
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,026
It's not gonna look as nice.

141
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,427
It's not gonna look as pretty.

142
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,162
You don't get the
colorful rings and things,

143
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,397
but that data is being stored

144
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,168
in that very, very large
database on the backend.

145
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,372
So, the health application
more or less keeps track of

146
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,742
all your health data versus
the activity application

147
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,210
which is really just
doing the workouts

148
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,111
and achievements and
things like that.

149
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,184
The primary health databases,
we are primarily going to

150
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,454
be looking at the healthdb
secure SQLite database.

151
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,990
Even though it says
secure in there,

152
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,159
it's not encrypted at all.

153
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,260
Now, it is coming out
of an encrypted backup,

154
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,064
so it is being protected,
but just because you see

155
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,067
the word encrypted or secure
in these database file names

156
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,003
does not mean it's SQLCiphered
or anything like that.

157
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:44,937
You can pull that out.

158
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,539
You can make your own queries.

159
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,142
We're gonna show
you some examples of
those as we go along.

160
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,110
There's the other
healthdb SQLite database

161
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,612
that also contains
some information

162
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,581
that Heather'll get into,
but primarily the stuff

163
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,251
that it's storing is
all your health data,

164
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,854
so workout, nonworkout-based
data, just general

165
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,056
living type data is being
stored in this database,

166
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,360
and these are huge databases.

167
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,062
I think I pulled mine
off, and it's about

168
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,165
90 megs or something like that.

169
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,434
It's extremely large
because it's persistent,

170
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,370
and it's storing a lot of
data over the multiple years

171
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,207
that I've had access to those
particular applications.

172
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,742
I got some pads in here.

173
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,744
If you do wanna go get on
the device or pull it out

174
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,979
of a backup, you're gonna
find it in the library

175
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,615
health directory on there
in both different databases

176
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,351
that we're gonna be talking
about in the presentation.

177
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,588
Another one that we found,
this one is relatively new.

178
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,856
This healthdb_secure.hfd.

179
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,296
This appears to be some
sort of encrypted file.

180
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,796
We think it's an
encrypted database.

181
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,099
We honestly can't see
the information in there,

182
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,402
and we really don't know what
this one is storing thus far,

183
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,706
but since Apple is introducing
a lot more health records

184
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,175
and privacy type stuff,
I'm kinda curious if

185
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,844
that's the stuff
that's being pushed

186
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,579
into that encrypted thing.

187
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,882
It looks like a database, but
I can't be completely sure,

188
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,485
so we just have some working
theories at this point.

189
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,154
We did not get time to
actually dig into that

190
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,156
and see what it was
actually all about.

191
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,894
- All right, a closer look
at some of these databases.

192
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,129
The first one that I
took a quick look at,

193
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,600
it's not as interesting
from the workout perspective

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,768
as the healthdb SQLite file.

195
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,272
Things you will find that
I always think are helpful.

196
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:30,376
If we start looking at
this, what types of devices

197
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,911
does the user have access to?

198
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,480
So, if you look at mine, it
shows all the Apple Watches

199
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,582
I've ever owned, so all
the different series.

200
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,385
Also, all of the iPhones
it was paired with

201
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,554
and the version that was
running on that IOS device.

202
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:43,989
So, if you're ever quizzed on

203
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,727
how many versions of
IOS was this user using,

204
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,629
look at the health database
file because it's going

205
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,132
to give you a quick glimpse
as Apple tracks this.

206
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:56,102
It's also going to show you
if the user is using Runkeeper

207
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,106
or MyFitnessPal or any
of the calorie type apps

208
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,675
that are syncing all
this information in.

209
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,578
All of this paired together
will really help you.

210
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,847
Another thing, and I didn't
realize this until I was doing

211
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,217
a scenario, that you'll see
later, that almost threw

212
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,718
my back out for this
presentation, so
I was gonna claim

213
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,523
some worker's comp against
SANS there if that occurred,

214
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:20,393
but luckily it
didn't, cloud pairing.

215
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,195
I expected as soon
as I did an activity

216
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,697
to dump my device,
and it would be there,

217
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:27,033
but I was doing it a little
too quickly, so I noticed

218
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,169
about a five minute lapse
after I completed an activity

219
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,973
until it was actually in cloud
or in my device for backup,

220
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,473
so just something
to consider there.

221
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,311
But it does show, when you
look at my health database,

222
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,681
that I am syncing with
cloud and all the pairing

223
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,015
that's actually occurring.

224
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,684
So, that's the primary
ones you'll see there,

225
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,154
and we'll cover these in a
little bit more detail here.

226
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,258
The health database secure
SQLite, again, not encrypted,

227
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,826
completely available
as long as you have

228
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,463
an encrypted backup file
that you can decrypt.

229
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,199
Things like achievements, so
have you met achievements?

230
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,301
It will also track the
last time that achievement,

231
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,137
so when we look at
these databases,

232
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,738
you'll see current activity,

233
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,408
and then the last time
that achievement was met,

234
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,944
your friends' achievements,
your workouts.

235
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,714
This is where a lot of
our stuff on heart rate,

236
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,183
how many steps you took,
when you're sleeping.

237
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,185
Is your watch on or is it off?

238
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,987
And you'll see why you
may actually work a case

239
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,420
where this stuff matters.

240
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,558
Right now, you're probably
thinking, who cares

241
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,426
on some of these
artifacts, but it is.

242
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,894
We're going to give
you forensic scenarios

243
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,030
where all of this
stuff comes into play,

244
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,932
and it is very, very helpful.

245
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:37,069
99% of your time is going to
be spent in this database here.

246
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,671
This is where a lot of
the bang for the buck is.

247
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,175
The records at the
bottom, this is newer,

248
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,779
and I honestly, I don't go to
the doctor unless I'm dying,

249
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,283
so that may come into play
later in our scenarios,

250
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,319
so I don't have medical records.

251
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,622
I'm lucky enough that I don't
really have many allergies.

252
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,623
Vaccinations, I feel like
unless you're a child

253
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,559
going to school, it
doesn't really matter,

254
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,560
so I don't have any of
these records syncing,

255
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,497
and Sarah doesn't either,
for us to tell you

256
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,098
what that's going to look
like, but that's something

257
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,168
that could occur in the
future should we get to it.

258
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,004
This slide here is
for your awareness.

259
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,674
You're going to see, we're
going to refer to data types,

260
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,310
and we wrote a lotta queries
to parse the health secure file

261
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,878
that we're going
to be focusing on.

262
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,548
But, main things you'll see
in our presentation coming up,

263
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,916
five is heart rate,

264
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,852
so we wanna see when
our heart rate spikes.

265
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,656
Also, number of steps
seven, flights climbed 12,

266
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,059
so these are the things
that really matter.

267
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,262
70 is is the watch on, so you
know if it's being tracked

268
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,665
through the watch or the
phone, and that will also come

269
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,967
into play in some of
our scenarios coming up.

270
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,769
So, this is more just
for your awareness

271
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,071
on what you're seeing here.

272
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,543
- First scenario, just a
simple pattern of life,

273
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,478
why do we care about
pattern of life?

274
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:53,746
It tells a story.

275
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,582
How does the user do
their daily stuff?

276
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:57,516
I get up in the morning.

277
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:58,617
I put my watch on.

278
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,785
I go to work.

279
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,654
I maybe go to a
workout in the morning,

280
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,123
in the afternoon, it
depends on the day,

281
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,225
and then at bedtime I
usually take it off.

282
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,526
I throw it on the charger.

283
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,295
Everybody has a
different pattern of

284
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,698
how they do their daily stuff.

285
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:13,866
So, a couple different things

286
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,601
that we can do
pattern of life on.

287
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,802
We could do the workouts.

288
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,037
How often are they working out?

289
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,673
Are they lazy like I
was a bout a year ago,

290
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,109
or are they doing it because
they feel like they might die?

291
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,543
Now, that's how I feel now.

292
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,445
Steps and distance, I'm
gonna show you an example

293
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,015
of my steps and distance
to kind of give you an idea

294
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,252
of what my pattern
particularly is.

295
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,121
You could do calories burned.

296
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,389
Are they burning
a lotta calories?

297
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,791
Why are they burning
a lotta calories?

298
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,826
Is it normal that
they're doing this?

299
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,728
And certainly heart rate,
heart rate, I think,

300
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,796
we're gonna focus on quite
a bit because it does tell

301
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,832
a lot about how
the person is doing

302
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,235
what they're doing
on a per day basis.

303
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,973
One example, so this
is one of my workouts.

304
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,641
Each workout, if you
set it up on your watch,

305
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,477
is tracking some metadata.

306
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,944
What was the weather?

307
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,180
Where was it?

308
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,448
Now, this one is showing that

309
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,084
it was 82 degrees
and 60% humidity.

310
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,152
I was doing it at Arlington,
and I have a workout

311
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,890
from about 11:30 in the morning
to 12:30 in the afternoon.

312
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,992
This was one of my
weekend workouts.

313
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,593
You can see how much
time, how many calories,

314
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,995
and all that good stuff too.

315
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,830
So, I could pull out
the metadata for this,

316
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,000
and I've highlighted some of
the interesting bits in there.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,903
I have locational information,
lat and long information.

318
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,404
I have the weather information,

319
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,174
whether the workout
occurred in the daytime

320
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,242
or in the nighttime, and we
do get a start and end time

321
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:34,013
for that too, so this
is purely just metadata.

322
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,216
The workout information's
stored in a different area,

323
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,484
but I do have highlighted here

324
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,287
in that pink column in
the middle there that

325
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,723
there is a data id associated
with a particular workout.

326
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,159
Now, there's a whole
table with the workouts,

327
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,261
with the health database
that you can pull out

328
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,597
and correlate that with there.

329
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,997
Now, you notice these queries.

330
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,700
This query is kind of large.

331
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,670
There is a lot of correlation
that you have to do

332
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,738
to pull all this
information together.

333
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:02,241
The health database
itself is not obvious.

334
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,709
You have to sit there.

335
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,877
You have to figure out what
all these different tables are,

336
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,814
and how they correlate
in between each other,

337
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,315
so we do have these queries.

338
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,685
Hopefully, they'll help you
in future investigations.

339
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,521
But, I'm purely looking at
one workout metadata here.

340
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,192
Now, I can take this metadata
and start correlating that

341
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,495
over multiple workouts, so I'm
gonna focus here on location.

342
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,632
Where is this person at
any given point in time?

343
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,166
You might need to know

344
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,969
are they on the West
Coast, on the East Coast?

345
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,339
Are they doin' workouts
in Florida, wherever,

346
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,407
might help an investigation.

347
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,610
So, I pulled out
some of my data here,

348
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,313
and Arlington is my home
base, so I do have a lot

349
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,516
of workouts in the Arlington
area, so I got Arlington.

350
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,584
That's the one I have
shown, another Arlington.

351
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,020
You kind of get a pattern.

352
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,188
Do I do morning workouts?

353
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,789
Do I do afternoon?

354
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,758
I certainly have a pattern.

355
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,628
I ideally would like to
get it done before work,

356
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,329
but sometimes I have
to do it after work,

357
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,164
and I'm always hitting it on
the weekends 'cause I have

358
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,768
a little bit more time
associated with that.

359
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,170
Now, I do have this
block of San Diego.

360
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,971
I travel a lot.

361
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,439
I teach a lot.

362
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,474
So, when I was in San
Diego, Heather and friends

363
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:12,478
dragged me out to do Orange
Theory at an ungodly hour

364
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:15,046
of like six a.m. or
something, and I went.

365
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,515
I complained.

366
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,484
I will always complain
about that, but I did get

367
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,654
three workouts done in San
Diego that particular week,

368
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,188
and then I came
back to Arlington,

369
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,723
so we do have some travel
information in there.

370
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,660
You might not care that
they had a workout,

371
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,996
but the travel information
could be potentially useful

372
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,164
in an investigation.

373
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,900
It's also worth noting
that the coordinates.

374
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,303
Coordinates are
actually pretty accurate

375
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,938
in my particular scenario.

376
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,840
This is my Orange
Theory gym in Boston.

377
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,109
The database location and
the actual gym location,

378
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,378
very, very close together.

379
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,747
Now, I do mention
this in my class.

380
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,949
You'll see there's a little

381
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,916
Dunkin' Donuts
thing right there.

382
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,486
If you look at your
significant locations before

383
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,623
sometimes it goes back and
forth between another location,

384
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,224
but it looks like
I'm at Dunkin' Donuts

385
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,626
for an hour every morning.

386
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,896
Not exactly good feeling.

387
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,765
It's actually the gym that's
right next door to it.

388
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,167
As much as I would
love to drink coffee

389
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,970
and stuff my face with
doughnuts every morning,

390
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,906
that's not gonna get
me to where I wanna be,

391
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,141
so take that with
a grain of salt.

392
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,776
Look at the locations,
does it make any sense?

393
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,879
I found mine to be
pretty darn accurate.

394
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,684
Now as far as another pattern,
steps or distance per day.

395
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,253
I'm not a big walker.

396
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,822
I tend to drive to work.

397
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,123
I don't walk to work
or anything like that.

398
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,324
It's the D.C. area.

399
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,793
I'm sitting in my
car most of the time,

400
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,429
so the pattern is
interesting in there.

401
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,665
This particular query,
I'm extracting the mileage

402
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,435
for each day for a
particular month.

403
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,105
I have some highlighted here.

404
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,907
One day, for some reason, I
couldn't go to my normal gym

405
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,243
and decided to just
run on a treadmill.

406
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,645
Just started running just
to see how far I could go,

407
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,515
and I knocked out a 5k which
I thought was pretty awesome.

408
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,018
I loathe running by the way.

409
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,154
I think it's the most boring
thing you could possibly do,

410
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,457
but I did that, and it'll show
you the mileage associated

411
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,861
with that, so that was
kind of an oddity for me.

412
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,263
Now we start graphing this.

413
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:15,367
Now, the problem with this
is that I can graph this

414
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,469
all day long, but if I
don't put context to it,

415
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,571
if I don't correlate
other data to it,

416
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,673
it's not gonna make
a whole lot of sense.

417
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,175
So, this is my month of April.

418
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,210
Now, the green bars,
this is the weekend

419
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,947
just to kinda give you a feel
for when this actually is.

420
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,916
So, I see some high
points in here.

421
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,219
But now, if I throw
in these little guys,

422
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,155
this is every single
time I did a workout.

423
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,424
So, I can pull that out
of the database as well,

424
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,626
and say I did workouts
on these particular days,

425
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,594
and these are the days
that I have higher mileage.

426
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,929
I'm running, I'm walking.

427
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,598
I'm doing something to
get that mileage up.

428
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,602
Then, I start putting my
calendar into play here.

429
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,304
So, I'm traveling
during this time too.

430
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,839
I'm teaching at SANS Orlando.

431
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,841
I spoke at BSidesCharm
at the end of the month,

432
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,444
so I did get a couple
of workouts in.

433
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,245
I don't workout as much
when I am traveling,

434
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,649
but I do tend to
get some workouts in

435
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,018
especially if Heather,
Phil, Rob start harassing me

436
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,721
to get up at ungodly
hours of the morning.

437
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,257
But now, if you look
here, I see some workouts.

438
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,726
There is this gap.

439
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,596
Right after SANS Orlando,
it kind of just drops.

440
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,898
Am I lazy?

441
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,266
Maybe, that has potential.

442
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,437
Maybe I'm just exhausted
from SANS Orlando, you know,

443
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,474
you don't know, and sometimes
you can't correlate that data.

444
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,977
This was actually
when I was out sick,

445
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,480
so came home, went
to work the next day.

446
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,549
I started feeling
just very, very ill.

447
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,685
Turns out I had to go
to the urgent care.

448
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,220
I had to go to the ER.

449
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,856
I have to get my gull bladder
out in about two weeks or so,

450
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,858
so that'll be fun, right?

451
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,328
Medically induced vacation
is what I like to call it.

452
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,431
So, that one day that
is particularly low,

453
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,299
I actually stayed home
from work that day.

454
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,202
I literally did nothing
'cause I was in so much pain,

455
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,105
and that does show in the data.

456
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,008
So, you can start correlating
this stuff, but nowhere,

457
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,611
at least nowhere I think,
on my phone could you find

458
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,479
a calendar entry
or something to say

459
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,515
that I went to urgent care
or something like that.

460
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,984
Maybe a receipt or something

461
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,019
that you can start
correlating that with.

462
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,322
So, context is key.

463
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,260
- All right, we have some
scenarios for you here.

464
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,229
Recently, there's a lot of
Apple health in the news,

465
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,798
and ironically while Sarah
and I were doing research

466
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,101
for this, I got several
student emails saying hey,

467
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,135
what about the health database?

468
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,069
What about this?

469
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,471
Can we pull this information?

470
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,339
So, we're trying to
replicate some things here.

471
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,010
So in the news, the Apple
health database was used,

472
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,712
and the forensic examiner
testified successfully

473
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,781
saying hey, this
woman was murdered.

474
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,883
She was dragged
down an embankment,

475
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,419
and then the man climbed
back up this hill,

476
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,454
and the detectives
replicated this.

477
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,688
They went through
the whole process

478
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,391
and proved this to be true.

479
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,960
So, this was kind of our
goal, and Sarah came up with

480
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,363
the brilliant idea of you
should drag your husband

481
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,798
and see what this looks
like, and I'm like yeah,

482
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,667
I can definitely
drag my husband.

483
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,602
Unfortunately, he
is not Sarah's size,

484
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,506
so you're going to get to
see what this looks like.

485
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,043
Just as another disclaimer,
in this database

486
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,578
that you're seeing
here on the left,

487
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,680
heart rate is data
type number five.

488
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,483
I have a really hard time
getting my heart rate to spike

489
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,886
and then stay up which I guess
is good for heart health,

490
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,088
very annoying for a
situation like this.

491
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,757
You could see here with
my heart rate, it spikes.

492
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,860
It starts at 66.

493
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,362
Sometimes my heart rate
is as low as like 53,

494
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,631
and I think that's weird.

495
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,832
I'm like wow, I'm
like an Olympian.

496
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,767
My husband's like
no, you have no heart

497
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,905
for it to detect anything,
so this is where perspective.

498
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,508
I think I'm more of
the healthier, but
he thinks no heart.

499
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,343
You can't find it.

500
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,911
Nothing can detect it.

501
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,147
But you can see, I go from
66, and then it spikes up,

502
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,948
and it gets to like 148.

503
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,384
You can also see
where it's highlighted

504
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,919
in the middle screen shot there.

505
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,421
My heart rate spiking, and
then what it looks like.

506
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,991
So, this is our situation here.

507
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,260
I had my husband lay
on a tarp because

508
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,296
I think that would be
easier to drag him.

509
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,797
My back was killing
me after this.

510
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,000
My knuckles were killing me
from trying to pull the tarp.

511
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,302
The tarp was actually
ripping at one point,

512
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,137
but we have a little video here.

513
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,405
(birds singing)
(Heather grunting)

514
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,673
of my struggles.

515
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:19,678
(Heather laughing)
(Heather grunting)

516
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,713
I know, I put socks on.

517
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,616
(Heather grunting)

518
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,620
I'm gonna need help.

519
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,422
This is fun.

520
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,158
- [Sarah] I'll help you.

521
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,794
(Heather grunting)

522
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,629
- It's bad.

523
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,601
(tarp crinkling)

524
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,908
Yeah, so I probably, I
didn't make it very far.

525
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,678
(audience applauding)
I did not make it very far.

526
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,280
I think I like ruined my
knees, my back, my wrists,

527
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,282
and Sarah's like I'm sorry.

528
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:58,716
I'm sorry for recommending that.

529
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,019
But, we wanted to
replicate this, so I did,

530
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,722
I wanted to pull him
down my entire yard.

531
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,591
I honestly probably
made it about 30 yards,

532
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,062
and then I walked back up
which wasn't very exciting,

533
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,197
so it only showed one flight,
so you're not seeing that,

534
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,100
but I didn't have
a steep embankment,
and I was also afraid

535
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,168
I would tumble down backwards
trying to drag his body

536
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,439
down an embankment, but he
plays a good dead person.

537
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,307
He is still alive,
so you'll see him.

538
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,608
He's actually at this summit.

539
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,043
But, this is what
it looked like.

540
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,777
So, you can see my normal
resting heart rate,

541
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:29,514
and then I dragged that body,
and it matches the date,

542
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,683
time stamps how long
it took me to do this,

543
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,287
but then you see some weird
spikes at the end there.

544
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,922
Sarah and I thought it
would be a little morbid,

545
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,158
but my four-year-old
wanted me to drag his body,

546
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,694
so we did not include
a video of that,

547
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,663
but I was able to drag
him a little faster

548
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,032
down the hill on
the tarp (laughing).

549
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,235
So yeah, sometimes your
kids just want that as well.

550
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,540
- [Sarah] Another
scenario, a couple things

551
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,743
that we wanted to try, again,
focusing on heart rate.

552
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,245
You get a lotta data
out of heart rate.

553
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,045
We had this scenario.

554
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,714
Again, we go dark.

555
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,417
What happens when somebody
dies when they have

556
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,387
their heart rate monitor
slash Apple Watch on?

557
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,956
Does it just drop, as far
as the heart rate goes?

558
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,426
Now, as much as I tried to
test this, it's very hard

559
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,495
to mimic dropping your heart
rate, and I tried to test it.

560
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,030
I took the Apple Watch off.

561
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,167
I kind of put it away from
my wrist, but it actually,

562
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:25,437
the detection of it was
quite good, quite accurate,

563
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,805
so I was unable to actually
drop that heart rate.

564
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,909
So, again, if you wanna
volunteer or somethin',

565
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,878
we can make this happen.

566
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:34,780
But that one is
particularly hard.

567
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,682
So, my theory is,
somebody gets murdered

568
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,918
or something, the heart
rate will drop depending on

569
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,021
how fast they lose
their heart rate.

570
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,824
So, what I did test was
more of the alive scenario.

571
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:50,629
So, showing the activity for
a particular person per day.

572
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,697
So, this is a, it has
a lot of assumptions.

573
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,300
The user must have
an Apple Watch,

574
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,270
something to track
their heart rate.

575
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,872
It's just gonna show periods
of activity versus rest,

576
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,507
so you can kind of get
a good feeling for that.

577
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,810
Also, if you're looking
and you're maybe doing

578
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,544
surveillance of the person,
you could figure out

579
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:09,181
what they're doing as
well, and you also wanna

580
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,149
correlate this with
other IOS activity,

581
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,684
so it's not just
the health database.

582
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,053
We also want to look at,
say, the application usage.

583
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,458
I kind of have one of
the other databases

584
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,326
that I've talked about in
previous presentations,

585
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,595
the current PowerLog,
that PL/SQL,

586
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,298
this is actually gonna show
you like an app-by-app basis

587
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,233
of what is being used
at any given time.

588
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,135
It is a fantastic database.

589
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,603
It used to be backed up.

590
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,040
It does not appear to be
backed up anymore in IOS 11,

591
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,774
so just a heads up on that.

592
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,412
Another day in the life.

593
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,581
This one is me in
a particular day.

594
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,983
I think it's April something.

595
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,152
I can't remember to be
perfectly honest with you.

596
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,920
This is me tracking
my heart rate.

597
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,757
So, you can make some
assumptions here.

598
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,493
You can look at the time stamps.

599
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:57,928
I put on my Apple Watch
at six a.m., so as soon as

600
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,165
I put the Apple Watch
on, it starts tracking.

601
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,501
It starts recording
my heart rate.

602
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,370
It does it maybe every, I
don't know, 30 seconds or so.

603
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,174
At the end of the
day, I take it off.

604
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,942
I go to bed, I put
it on the charger.

605
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,378
So, we got about
six a.m. to 10 p.m.

606
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,312
That in and of itself
is very useful,

607
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,048
so you can kinda get a
good feeling if you know

608
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,017
that they wear their
Apple Watch all the time,

609
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,287
how long they were doin'
their thing during the day.

610
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,224
Now, if you look at the
actual beats per minute,

611
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,961
it gets up there to about
180, and it looks like

612
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,464
it's for most of the day
until you start looking

613
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,633
at the times stamps
associated with that.

614
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,969
My heart rate is not at 180
beats per minute all day long.

615
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:42,407
That would probably make
somebody die doing that.

616
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,809
When you do a workout,
when you actually set

617
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,745
your Apple Watch,
you do a workout,

618
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,979
the heart rate monitor
itself is actually doing

619
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,183
a little bit more sampling,
so every few seconds or so,

620
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,319
it's actually taking a
heart rate sample of it

621
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:55,720
to better track your workout,

622
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,756
your calories and
things like that.

623
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,558
Again, putting
context to the data,

624
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,560
knowing how the health
application works,

625
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,128
how the heart rate
monitor works,

626
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,663
is gonna give you a
little bit more data.

627
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,898
So, this whole blue
section here is really just

628
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,767
a one-hour workout, but
once you take that out

629
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,370
and then start
correlating over the day

630
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,505
without the workout
information, you'll actually see

631
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,975
the spikes and things as
I go throughout my day,

632
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,177
if I walk up stairs,
things like that.

633
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,749
- One of the questions that
came up in email, ironically,

634
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,284
and why Sarah looked
at that, and obviously

635
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:29,854
we can't mimic death, I had
a previous student email me.

636
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,224
He is working an investigation
where they believe

637
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,695
the wife was killed on a
Tuesday, and that the husband

638
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,697
took her phone and
texted her friends

639
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,864
as if she were still
alive for three days.

640
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,701
So, he actually sent
me the health data,

641
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,469
which I can't, obviously,
share with you,

642
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,471
to just take a look
at what he is seeing,

643
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,574
and every day he tracked
where her watch was put on,

644
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,877
and then the heart rate just
stops, so he wanted to know

645
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,982
is that when the battery on
the watch died or did she die?

646
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,850
So, he was trying to
correlate that with

647
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,752
what the coroner said
on time of death,

648
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,088
but what's really creepy
is you will see activity

649
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,824
from the phone as her
husband, it was like taking

650
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:09,327
88 steps as he's like
walking around texting people

651
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,529
from her device, but it's
no longer on her watch.

652
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,164
So, things like that
really do come into play,

653
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,133
but, again, we didn't
have a dead body,

654
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,902
or someone die in front of
us fortunately to test this.

655
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,505
- [Sarah] Just hold on a
second, we gotta test this.

656
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,774
Can we strap this watch
onto you real fast?

657
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:24,008
Really fast?

658
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,477
- So, another reason
you can have this.

659
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,912
You can nark on your homies,
or this can motivate you

660
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,348
when I'm sitting at I'm
desk, and I'm like damn,

661
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,584
everyone did a workout, and
everyone, the only friends

662
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,119
I share this with are
Phil, Rob and Sarah.

663
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,587
Those are my only friends.

664
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,555
So, when they all complete
it, and I'm like man,

665
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,092
I'm not doin' so well, but
then on this particular day,

666
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,561
so I see, I was like
what did Phil do today

667
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,496
that he's at 135%?

668
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,899
Phil did yoga, so if
you wanna see some

669
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,869
of Phil's yoga moves,
you can check that out.

670
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,137
That actually surprised me.

671
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,605
I thought that was
a good one there,

672
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,242
but there is a contacts.dat
file, and this will show

673
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,078
who you're sharing your health
activity information with.

674
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,882
Where this may be useful is
if I'm under investigation,

675
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,484
and you only have Sarah's
device, and she's cooperating,

676
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,986
you will get some of my
information from her device

677
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,022
because we share it
with one another.

678
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,891
This contacts.dat file
is hideous looking.

679
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,860
I use Celebrate to look at this,

680
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,963
and this is something that
made it look a lot nicer

681
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,899
versus just the blobs
that you'll normally see,

682
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,502
but just to be clear,
it did not parse it.

683
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,206
I used the tool to look at the
data that I stumbled across.

684
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,708
Then, we took it a step
further, and I tried every

685
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,813
forensic tool I have access
to to parse this information.

686
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,182
Oxygen Forensics did the best.

687
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,650
This is what you see.

688
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,752
Some things they do really
well, and some things

689
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,288
it needs a little work and
validation on your part.

690
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,324
So, here we can see
two flights climbed

691
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:48,860
in my health secure database,
and that may not seem

692
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,795
like a lot of flights climbed,
but I was 40-weeks pregnant

693
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,265
trying to walk that
baby out of my system

694
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,735
before I was forced to
have her the next morning.

695
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,436
So, you can see I have
two flights climbed.

696
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,772
What is incorrect
here, time zone,

697
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,942
so it's just UTC
versus local time.

698
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,411
The query we wrote, we
said show us in local time

699
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,947
versus UTC, so if you're
not sure about your tool

700
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,482
just make sure you validate it.

701
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,485
On the far right side, you
can see all the categories

702
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,321
that Oxygen is pulling
our for you saying hey,

703
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,491
if you care about heart rate,
or if you care about pulse,

704
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,725
you can just click on those,

705
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,260
and it will show you
that information.

706
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,662
I cannot stress enough to
make sure you validate it.

707
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,231
Why you need to validate.

708
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:30,769
Oxygen things I'm a male
which I have no idea why.

709
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,703
It's very interesting.

710
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,905
They must know my alter ego.

711
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,307
So, if you look there
on the left also,

712
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,177
that picture of my bulldog
when he was a puppy,

713
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,545
I have no idea where
Oxygen's pulling that from.

714
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,982
That is not my profile
picture on anything,

715
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,851
but apparently at some point
in time it must have been.

716
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:50,221
It also has my birthday
wrong by one day,

717
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,991
and I assume that's just because
of the time zone settings,

718
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,627
so on the left, that
is what Oxygen shows.

719
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,594
That I'm male.

720
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,630
My birthday's wrong by one day.

721
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,565
It does show my
blood type though,

722
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,201
and do you notice in that
next screen from my phone

723
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,236
it does not have
my blood type set.

724
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,605
It's pulling that because
I'm an organ donor,

725
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,441
so we believe it's going in
and looking at organ donation

726
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,810
where I have my blood type set,

727
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,344
and that's where
it's pulling that.

728
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:17,582
On the far right side, that is
the truth in the information

729
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,918
just so you could go and verify

730
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,386
all of the data that you see.

731
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:27,324
So, in summary here, we
assume that all this data

732
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,027
will be accessible in cloud.

733
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,662
I know that a lot of the vendors

734
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,564
are chasing health
data in cloud.

735
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,700
I know that ElcomSoft is going
to release this capability

736
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,536
in the next two months,
so just stay tuned.

737
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,504
There will probably
be some kind of

738
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,139
blog post or follow up on this.

739
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,108
We obviously need to
test medical records.

740
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,743
To be honest, I'm
probably never going to

741
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,513
put medical records into
my phone because I don't

742
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,683
care enough to do that, but if
anyone ever comes across this

743
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,184
and sees what the
information looks like,

744
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,319
please let us know.

745
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,023
We cannot stress enough, when
a tool comes out and says hey,

746
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,559
we support all your health
data, does it really?

747
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,560
Does it get it all?

748
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,661
Does it know how
to correlate it?

749
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,763
Does it understand time stamps?

750
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,198
Always validate your tools
because at some point,

751
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,735
there is going to be
something that is not correct.

752
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,939
- Yeah again, tool support
is certainly lacking.

753
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,407
This is a great opportunity

754
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,810
for writing scripts,
writing queries.

755
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,578
We've done the queries,
but actually putting

756
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,379
and correlating all
the data together

757
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,082
there is a lot of
work to be done.

758
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:28,086
This database is gigantic
with just a ton, a ton

759
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,055
of records in it which is good
from a forensics perspective.

760
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,423
You always want more data.

761
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:35,093
More data is nothing
to complain about.

762
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,529
So, as far as other tracking,
because of these data bases,

763
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,998
these records,
there is stuff that

764
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,267
we certainly didn't
have time to talk about.

765
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,136
Are you interested in
testing a scenario?

766
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:45,970
Get out there.

767
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,272
Test it yourself.

768
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,107
Like those investigators
in Germany.

769
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,408
They needed to test something.

770
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,943
They wanted to see what
it actually looked like,

771
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,344
so they found a guy.

772
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,546
The said hey, can you
do this one thing.

773
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:58,883
You have the same
build as a suspect,

774
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,551
and they actually did
some active research,

775
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:04,187
some active testing, so I
encourage you to do so as well.

776
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,357
Or, you know what, just get
out there and get motivated,

777
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:09,793
get out from in front of
the computer, go to the gym.

778
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:10,662
I know it sucks.

779
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,063
I'm with you there.

780
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,965
But, you know, it'll probably
make your life better

781
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,899
if you don't, you know,
start running and just fall

782
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,671
off the treadmill like I tend
to do every once in a while.

783
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,806
So, this is, again,
this is part technical.

784
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,341
It's part motivation.

785
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:26,144
We've been workin' our butts
off the last year mostly due

786
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,580
to peer pressure, a good
peer pressure in this case.

787
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,418
We hope you enjoyed some
of the DFIRfit tweets

788
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,419
that we've kind of
sprinkled throughout here.

789
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,822
A lot of those folks are
in this audience right now,

790
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,756
so if you see them,
high five them.

791
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,759
They've done a great job.

792
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,529
Hope you guys use the
hashtag in the future as well

793
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,564
'cause it really has taken off.

794
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,068
If you wanna see any
more of our research,

795
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,369
we both have blogs
that are out there.

796
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,004
We have not listed
the blogs on here,

797
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,506
but we both also teach classes,

798
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,876
and we're here for the
next 10 days or so.

799
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,578
Heather is teaching her 585.

800
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,213
I'm teaching my Mac forensics,

801
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,014
so smartphone and Mac forensics.

802
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,850
We're teaching in a
lotta different places,

803
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,453
going to some awesome
places, Prague, Sydney,

804
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,556
Vegas of course,
Miami in November.

805
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,925
Oh, what a hardship
that is, right?

806
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,426
- [Heather] Cindy's
in Paris in two weeks.

807
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,828
That's a tough one.

808
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,163
- [Sarah] Yeah, tough,
tough, tough gig right there.

809
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,066
So, if you are interested in
classes, check the schedule,

810
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,901
check the websites on there,

811
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,837
and they are available
on demand too

812
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,440
which means you can take
these at the gym, right?

813
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,976
You can take your
laptop on the treadmill.

814
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,244
Anybody do that?

815
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,346
Am I the only nerd who's
probably done that?

816
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,015
- [Heather] I would
fall, so that's not good.

817
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,818
- [Sarah] I'd definitely have
fallen, definitely, worth it.

818
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,754
But again, I hope you
enjoyed the presentation.

819
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,956
If you've got any questions
for us, please let us know.

820
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,259
We do have, I think, a
few minutes for questions.

821
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:52,063
In the meantime, I'm gonna
share a few other tweets here,

822
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,264
some of my other favorites.

823
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,533
Again, all of these guys
are in the audience.

824
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,069
So, thank you.

825
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,538
- [Heather] One more thing,
Sarah and I are both releasing

826
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,240
brand new forensic
challenges this week.

827
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,509
So, if you've taken our
classes in the past,

828
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,377
brand new challenges
being introduced,

829
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,013
so, you may wanna take it again.

830
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,449
- [Sarah] Yeah, yep, you
might wanna take it again,

831
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,917
brand new data sets.

832
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:13,851
- [Heather] Brand new
data set and our brand new

833
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,019
smartphone poster's available

834
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,721
for you guys out there as well.

835
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,190
- [Man] All right,
big round of applause.

836
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,726
(audience applauding)

837
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,662
(electronic music)
