1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,036
(serene music)

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,746
(audience applause)

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:15,448
- When I was in high
school, I took a shop class.

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,384
And the very first
day of the class,

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,019
the teacher handed
out an assignment.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,887
It was just one page and it
had 20 items written on it.

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,224
He handed out this white piece
of paper gave it to us all,

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,126
hands down, or face
down, excuse me,

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,496
and he said, "This
is an assignment,

10
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,964
"but it's also a little
bit of race, right?

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,065
"So, finish this, make
sure you do it right,

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,869
"but the first person
who finishes wins."

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,437
This isn't high school, I
don't remember what we won,

14
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,506
but I remember them like,
"All right, let's do this,

15
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,774
"I'm gonna win this thing.

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,308
"This is gonna be good."

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:45,779
And so the teacher says go,
and I flip over the paper.

18
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,481
The very first thing
on the paper says,

19
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,650
read all the instructions
on this piece of paper

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,152
before you move on to step two.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,821
And I'm thinking,
"Cool, it's a race.

22
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,321
"No, I'm not gonna do that.

23
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,758
"I'm gonna keep going down
through this piece of paper."

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,995
So the second question or
instruction is something like,

25
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:05,665
write down every odd
number from one to 30.

26
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,601
It's pretty benign,
but it's pretty random.

27
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,170
So I'm like, "Okay, whatever."

28
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,339
And then the questions

29
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,708
start getting
progressively less benign,

30
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,910
I guess, for me personally.

31
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,610
I think they start
off with like,

32
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,979
maybe clap your hands
three times, right,

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,214
this is a quiet classroom,

34
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,582
so clap, that's
pretty disruptive.

35
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,683
It's like okay, weird.

36
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,020
It gets down to like
shout your name out.

37
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,455
And I'm like, "All right,

38
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,689
"I'm the first
person to do this?

39
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,723
"All right, I'll
shout my name out.

40
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,859
"This feels very strange."

41
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,994
And I get down to
like towards the end,

42
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,262
It's like take off
your left shoe,

43
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,731
and put it on the
table next to you.

44
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm just like, "Okay, cool."

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,801
Question 20.

46
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,305
Thank you for reading all these
instructions ahead of time,

47
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,840
write your name
in the top corner

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,242
and sit there quietly, you
finished the exercise right?

49
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,311
So I'm not feeling (chuckles)
very good at this point.

50
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,512
That's kind of a problem.

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,448
But the whole point of
this exercise, I think,

52
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,717
in the teachers perspective
is that this is shop class,

53
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,419
there is things in
here that can hurt you.

54
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,920
The lesson is it's
very important

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,323
to read all the instructions
carefully and follow them.

56
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,759
So that's all I remember
from that class,

57
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,895
so I guess it was a
pretty effective lesson.

58
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:12,132
But I'm not talking about
shop class, obviously,

59
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,033
I'm talking about
web browser stuff.

60
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,668
Because like Chad says, that's
one of my side passions,

61
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,138
I have other jobs in forensics,

62
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,407
but my side go-to project always
been stuff on web browsers.

63
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,209
So it's kind of
like my go-to thing.

64
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,347
And this is probably
the least catchy title

65
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,615
to talk of ever thought of.

66
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,984
Officially summarizing
web browsing activity.

67
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,752
But basically, I kind of want
to talk about some things.

68
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:35,889
I learned as far as how
you can use a summary

69
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,191
and an overview to make
things more efficient.

70
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,794
So an overview can save time

71
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,396
before an in-depth
investigation.

72
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,631
This is kind of like my premise,

73
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,999
is when we trying
to convince you guys

74
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,966
during this presentation.

75
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,936
So like back to my
shop class example.

76
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,404
If I had read all
the instructions

77
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,772
it probably would have
taken me 30 seconds,

78
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,474
I would have finished
the exercise instantly

79
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,609
and skipped all that work
and the embarrassment,

80
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,145
but I didn't.

81
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,513
So, that's like a lesson
to take to heart, I guess.

82
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,750
And so I also wanted
to kind of take a,

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,485
before I start talking
about this overview thing,

84
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,153
and why I think
it's a good idea,

85
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,888
why would you wanna save time?

86
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,524
I mean that's kind of
like not a silly question,

87
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,993
but it's something
that, in my experience,

88
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,561
I've had a range
of forensic jobs.

89
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,364
I started off as an intern
at the FBI in an RCFL,

90
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,266
so that's kind of
one experience.

91
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,466
I moved on to working

92
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,469
in small consulting
forensic shops.

93
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,506
I worked at a stock at a
large healthcare organization

94
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,874
and I worked for
other consultants

95
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,676
like doing IR and
forensics, things like that.

96
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,876
So I've kind of seen the gamut,

97
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,512
but it still is
just my perspective.

98
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,280
But from my perspective,

99
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,983
I've been getting more and more
devices that come in, right,

100
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,419
and the same amount of time to
the analysis is still fixed.

101
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,254
So anything you can do to
make yourself more efficient

102
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,957
I really latch on to that,
because it really helps me.

103
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,594
And anecdotally I've kind
of heard this saying,

104
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,061
if you're like in
law enforcement,

105
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,997
these labs are getting
more and more devices,

106
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,333
the backlogs are growing.

107
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,501
And now, if you're doing
IR as like a consultant,

108
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,936
you might be called on to a site

109
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,005
to investigate 50,000
endpoints for something.

110
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,307
You just can't do things
the same way you used to.

111
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,809
You need to be more efficient.

112
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,579
And so that's why I wanna,
this is all my perspective,

113
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,283
my kind of experience,

114
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,951
but I wanna gather somewhere
evidence around this

115
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,753
and ask people what
their experience is,

116
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,787
and get a broader
understanding of this.

117
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:19,525
So I put out a survey about
investigating web browsers.

118
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:21,594
I don't know any of
you guys saw that,

119
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,695
some of you responded to
it, so thank you very much,

120
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,298
I very much appreciate that.

121
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,668
But the survey was kind
of targeted to this room.

122
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,304
Actually, I kind of promoted
it on Twitter on DFIR,

123
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,905
which I think a lot of
people here in the summit,

124
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:33,739
are active on.

125
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,808
And I also put out a link

126
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,311
on one of the SANS
alumni emailing lists.

127
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,013
So I think it should be
kind of representative

128
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,414
of the people that are here.

129
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,717
And so I'm gonna be referencing
some of the questions

130
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,186
and answers from the survey,
throughout my presentation.

131
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,022
I just think it's kind
of giving some background

132
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,257
and it broadens the
experience a little bit.

133
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,727
So first question,

134
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,828
how many devices do you
investigate each month?

135
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:00,667
I took two takes on this.

136
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,868
The first part was
how many devices

137
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,403
did you investigate
for any reason?

138
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,637
And the next one
was how many devices

139
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,607
do you investigate
physically for browsers?

140
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,842
So this was kind of
to get an idea of,

141
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,211
like what percentage
of computers

142
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,613
you look at web browsers on.

143
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,217
All investigations, the
weighted average, was around 14.

144
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,821
And for looking at web
browsers, it was around 9.

145
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,523
So around 2/3 of cases,

146
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:25,358
people look at information
on web browsers.

147
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,526
I think that's a good thing.

148
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,860
I think web browsers
are our clutch

149
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,829
in so many investigations.

150
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,064
There's so many
useful artifacts,

151
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,999
and so often web browsers

152
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,302
are the way that people
access everything else,

153
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,770
in their digital life.

154
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,806
So I think web browsers are
really gold mine of information.

155
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,178
So also on that, is how many
devices does each person have?

156
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,512
Like when I started
off my career,

157
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,714
I think it'd be very typical.

158
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,148
You said one person,
if you're doing a case,

159
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,218
you have one server or
one computer, one laptop

160
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,253
and you do a dead-drive
image using forensics

161
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,520
and that was kind of it, right?

162
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,923
That's almost never
the case, nowadays.

163
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,324
At least again at my experience.

164
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,093
So I wanna see what
other people thought.

165
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,363
Not surprising, that
the most common answer

166
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,631
is one computer and one mobile.

167
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,566
So again everybody that seems
pretty representative, right?

168
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,102
Everybody has a
cell phone nowadays,

169
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,369
everybody has a computer.

170
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,673
If you're looking at just
getting someone's actions,

171
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,241
you're not only
looking at one thing.

172
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:17,075
It's gonna very quickly multiply

173
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,578
the scope of your investigation,

174
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,214
and can exponentially increase
the amount of work you have

175
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,482
with the amount of
hard drive sizes

176
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,617
that are kind of
going up enough.

177
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,852
I thought I was interesting

178
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,453
that no one answered
one mobile device.

179
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,688
Like if you're investigating
mobile devices,

180
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,157
you're gonna have a
truckload of them.

181
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,192
This kind of reminds me of
from Lee's presentation,

182
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,128
like we expected the one
laptop and then what you got?

183
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,361
Like all those other things.

184
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,630
That happens in lots of cases.

185
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,032
So anything you can
do to be effective

186
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,034
and triage, and get answers
quickly, or disqualify devices,

187
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,772
I think can really help you
accelerate your investigations.

188
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,208
And then you get back to
putting a number on this stuff.

189
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,676
Is how much time do you spend

190
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,212
reviewing browser
activity per device?

191
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,914
So this was, I wanted
to know how much time

192
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,150
are you looking at the analysis.

193
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,185
Not how much time your
computer's cranking away

194
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:02,422
at processing and whatever
spreadsheets you're putting out.

195
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,656
But how much time are
you actually looking

196
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,491
and trying to use your
brain to figure out

197
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,727
and draw some correlation
from what happened?

198
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,695
And again, not surprisingly,

199
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,832
there are pretty few sub
15-minute investigations.

200
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,766
I think that'd be awesome,

201
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,268
but that's really a short time

202
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,837
to get a really substantive
answer on anything.

203
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,104
It was common one,

204
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,807
I was in this 50 minutes
to one-hour bucket

205
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:22,408
and the weighted average
was around 90 minutes.

206
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,843
So you look at your computer,

207
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,478
look at your browser history
for around 90 minutes.

208
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,946
I think, again, that
kind of giant screen

209
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,914
with my experience.

210
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,051
And so, if you look
at how many devices,

211
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,352
how many people you
investigate each month,

212
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,887
how many devices you look at,

213
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,722
how many devices each person
has, how much time for this?

214
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,424
This can turn out

215
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,693
to be a large amount of
time you're spending.

216
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,995
And so even if you have
some small kind of savings,

217
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,497
I think it can
help you out a lot.

218
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,933
So this wasn't a
survey question,

219
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,001
but I was basically combining
the results to the questions

220
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,137
and trying to find
some insights.

221
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,772
So this is the
investigation time,

222
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,674
how much time you spent
looking at the evidence,

223
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:57,909
versus the number of devices
that you look at per month.

224
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,847
And so I expected there to
be a almost like a line.

225
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,250
So you'd have a lot of devices
in the top right corner,

226
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,785
for you guys.

227
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,019
Like a very few devices,

228
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,821
you spend lots of
time digging on it.

229
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,523
If you're more like
in a stock scenario,

230
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,091
if you've lost the devices,
you did a quick triage,

231
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,759
you're looking for
one particular thing.

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,228
So they're very, very small.

233
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,029
I didn't quite pan out
that way to the extremes,

234
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,365
but I think in general
it kind of follows that.

235
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,636
And so it doesn't really
matter where you are

236
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,505
on this spectrum, I
think anything we can do,

237
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,306
to help you move
slightly to the left,

238
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,842
in this case, we're using
slightly less time per device,

239
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,612
I think that'll help you
in the cumulative savings.

240
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,481
It's enough about
the setting the stage

241
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,915
for all the background stuff.

242
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,217
So back to,

243
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,753
an overview can save time before
an in-depth investigation.

244
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,623
So what should you
put in this overview?

245
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,591
The first thing that
I think you should use

246
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,961
is utilize visualizations to
reveal trends and patterns.

247
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,429
So visualizations
we're really living

248
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,632
in an almost a golden
age of visualizations.

249
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,368
For a while now, as
you guys are all aware,

250
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,404
more and more devices
and apps and whatnot,

251
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,473
are collecting more and
more information about you.

252
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:01,707
And now people are starting

253
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,942
to want to get access
to that information.

254
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,410
There's all these
personal dashboards,

255
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,478
all this kind of things
that are kind of popping up,

256
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,748
as far as how to make
really cool visualizations.

257
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,249
Like the New York Times,

258
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,484
puts out its really good
interactive visualizations

259
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,387
on things to make their
stories more catchy.

260
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,854
So there's lots of
really good examples

261
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,557
of visualizations out there

262
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,893
to help people get a good
handle on a big data set.

263
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,162
And that's something

264
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,397
where the visualizations
are very strong.

265
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,532
Because they're kind
of, by definition,

266
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,368
they kind of compress the
data you're looking at.

267
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,171
You have to summarize things
to fit it in a visualization.

268
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,639
You can have a million
rows spreadsheet

269
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,842
be fitted in a three by
three image if you want to.

270
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,444
You're obviously gonna
lose some information,

271
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,880
but if you're trying to get an
overview of the whole thing,

272
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,782
or kind of getting your
hands around the data,

273
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,784
I think it's a really
good way to do it.

274
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,321
There's also this
guy, like I guess,

275
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,222
he's like the grandfather
of visualization.

276
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,723
His name is Edward Tufte

277
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,259
and he has written
a number of books

278
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,261
and they're really awesome
as far as visualizations.

279
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,030
I kind of like visualizations
for lots of reasons.

280
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,332
But I'll just kind
of flip through them,

281
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,733
not even reading them sometimes,

282
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:01,968
and just kind of
go for inspiration,

283
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,703
for different ways to
process information.

284
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,871
So I think visualizations
are awesome.

285
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,743
So with that, this is
an open-source tool,

286
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,278
that I'm releasing today.

287
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,046
So it's called Synopsis.

288
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,782
This is basically a proof
of concept kind of tool

289
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,818
that just shows you
some visualizations

290
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,453
from browser
history information.

291
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,922
This is from Exabeam,
Exabeam Labs,

292
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,224
this is our first
open-source kind of tool.

293
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,892
It's basically cut in two parts,

294
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,394
there's a small Python script

295
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,730
that just processes some
Chrome browser information

296
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,964
that you point it to,

297
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,566
and then there's a
standalone web page

298
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,802
where you load the JSON file
the Python scripts generates,

299
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,704
and then it shows
these little graphs.

300
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,074
So there's not,
and I'll be honest,

301
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,676
there's not a lot of things
in this Synopsis program

302
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,512
that are super novel
or groundbreaking,

303
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,780
it's just showing you,

304
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,382
how you can use these
visualization techniques

305
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,416
to look at browser history.

306
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,918
The way synopsis works is,

307
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,787
there's all these little cards
that are in this web page.

308
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,622
So I'm gonna drop some of
these cards in the presentation

309
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,957
to show you some examples,

310
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,425
and I'm also gonna
pull in examples

311
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,426
from other commercial
or open source tools

312
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,261
that do the same kind of thing,

313
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,629
because this by no means

314
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,098
is not all fully on
visualizations for forensics.

315
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,868
And there's lots of other open,

316
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,836
there's just other
tools out there

317
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,872
that you can take the output
and process it some way

318
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,040
to make your own visualizations.

319
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,974
So I'll talk about
that just a little bit.

320
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,644
So this more get
your ideas going,

321
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,680
as far as how you can
use visualizations.

322
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,650
Back to the survey.

323
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,685
How do you find things
of interest right?

324
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,689
What, I mean I should certainly
be surprised, I guess.

325
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,725
The most popular answer
was a timeline, right?

326
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,160
Forensic people love timelines.

327
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,829
We gonna timeline everything,
timeline all the things.

328
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,733
But cool, but since we're
doing that, we're time lining,

329
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,069
we have millions and millions
of rows in these timelines.

330
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,838
And it's really hard to
find that first spot.

331
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,073
If you have a time stamp

332
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,574
or some kind of known
start an incident,

333
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,810
you can use that to begin
with, cool, that makes sense.

334
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,579
And if you do, how
do you get a hand,

335
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,814
like get your arms around,

336
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,051
this million lines of logs or
whatever you're looking at?

337
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,654
Timeline.

338
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,255
You can look at it kind
of in a macro view.

339
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,657
This is from Synopsis,

340
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,592
but again this is definitely
not something novel.

341
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,595
Overview of how many events
that happen each day,

342
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,031
you can very quickly see
spikes, you can see valleys,

343
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,598
you can see periods
of inactivity,

344
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,468
you can almost kind of
spot the weekends in there,

345
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,401
where it drops down.

346
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,170
This is from a work computer.

347
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,771
So it just, it makes sense.

348
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,478
Oh this is from a
commercial tool.

349
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,813
Overview of the
time information.

350
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,482
I'm actually not sure how
old the screenshot is,

351
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,550
might look different, but
yeah there's a big timeline.

352
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,886
You click on it, you zoom
into a smaller timeline

353
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:34,887
and then at the very bottom,

354
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,920
there's actually
this information

355
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,356
that shows you the records.

356
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,591
So there's a lot of
different ways to approach

357
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,593
using these kind of
overview on timelines

358
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,928
to make sure you don't
get lost in the details.

359
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,567
So how often do you form
each type of review?

360
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,136
This is another survey question.

361
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,472
And these sods they post is,

362
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,740
you can kind of dig into later

363
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,408
if you're interested
in that kind of thing.

364
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,778
But the first two questions
on here are basically,

365
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,347
if you're looking at a
small number of websites,

366
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,182
the first one is solely
looking at one website,

367
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,450
and the second question is,

368
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
you're looking at
handful websites.

369
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,254
So for the first example say
it's a malware investigation,

370
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,890
or an IR kind of thing, and
you have a (mumbles) URL.

371
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,595
So you just want to see how
many devices access this URL.

372
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,597
It's a very simple query,

373
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,098
you wanna know the
answer yes or no,

374
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,667
and if it's not, then you
don't care about the device.

375
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,203
So knowing that one thing
from the browser history,

376
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,038
can be extremely helpful.

377
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,540
For the second one, if
you wanna know activity,

378
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,007
on a handful of websites,

379
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,343
maybe you only care about
stuff on Facebook and Twitter,

380
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,378
maybe only care about
social media kind of things.

381
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,649
You just wanna see those
small bits of information.

382
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,819
And then just in
the bottom there,

383
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,320
the least common type of review

384
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,924
was comprehensive line by line.

385
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,092
That's awesome, I would love
to have time to do that,

386
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,794
but you almost never have time.

387
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,962
There's some cases that warrant

388
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,430
super super in-depth
investigation,

389
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,665
but realistically it just
doesn't really happen.

390
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,841
So there's this thing, on
those first two examples,

391
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,843
we're talking about one or a
handful of websites, right?

392
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,313
And so for the big overview,
doesn't really work

393
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,682
because it compresses
information.

394
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,184
The summary collapses all these
variables down to one thing,

395
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,752
just how many events per day.

396
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,820
So why don't you just look
at the same kind of overview,

397
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,823
but it's for a single
domain, a single website,

398
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,824
a single, whatever
you're interested in.

399
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,895
So Tufte, that guy
I was talking about,

400
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,297
he has this idea
called sparklines.

401
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,832
So sparklines are
these little graphs

402
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:30,135
that you can embed almost like
in a paragraph if you wanted.

403
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,704
The point is that
they're one-dimensional.

404
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,671
They show one thing, so
you just kinda get a feel

405
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:34,940
for what's going on.

406
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,442
Like you might take a
paragraph to describe

407
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,310
all those high activity, and
those low activities here,

408
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,277
or if used to draw
a little line,

409
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,779
just google and that shows it,

410
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,248
you kind of get the same
answer much more quickly.

411
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,416
So I'm calling this domain
sparks instead of sparklines.

412
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,353
So it's just, you've got
one domain, (mumbles).

413
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,822
This happens to be
the website firm,

414
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,323
that I used for every RSS feeds.

415
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,292
Apparently for some reason
there's some gap there,

416
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,660
I didn't look at it at all.

417
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,396
If this was an investigation,

418
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,430
and I was cared about this
website on this time period,

419
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,699
if I see there's
a gap right here

420
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,334
and that's when I
knew it happened,

421
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,736
I could immediately,
not immediately,

422
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,304
but I could potentially
discard this device

423
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,572
and not look at it further.

424
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,907
If it's the only device I had,

425
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,675
it could be a very big clue

426
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,310
that I don't have all
the devices I need

427
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,678
that are relevant
for investigations.

428
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,280
So go out and find more devices.

429
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,685
The other thing that Tufte says,

430
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,686
is another way of
looking visualizations

431
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,422
and it's called small multiples.

432
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,591
So small multiples
are where you have

433
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,227
the same style of
graph just shrink down,

434
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,194
you do the same
thing multiple times,

435
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,597
but with a different
series of data.

436
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,732
So you see in graphs
a lot of times,

437
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,201
you'll have all the infinite
series overlaid on each other.

438
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,270
So that's good for
some situations,

439
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,072
but I also find it useful
if you separate them

440
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,540
in these small multiples

441
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,675
and you can very easily kind
of compare and contrast,

442
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,576
what's going on.

443
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,946
So you can't read
the domains on this,

444
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,481
but you can see it's
very easy to use

445
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,518
to see for relative periods
of activity or inactivity

446
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,453
across the different sites.

447
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,322
So these are all
cards from Synopsis.

448
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,756
The way it works in Synopsis,

449
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,326
is the top three domains
you access by default

450
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:03,329
pop like these
cards, these sparks,

451
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,597
but you can add them in
that website box right there

452
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:06,799
and delete them if you want

453
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,434
by clicking little
X on the side.

454
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,935
So this is again,

455
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,136
if you have like some you know
bad.com you wanna look for,

456
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,237
type it in there.

457
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,706
If there's no activity,
then (groans),

458
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,741
this didn't happen from
this browser on this device.

459
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,448
So timelines are great.

460
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,718
But what if you don't wanna
look at your data linearly?

461
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,185
What if you're
trying to get a feel

462
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,620
kind of that pattern of life.

463
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,788
Like well, how this easily
typically does stuff

464
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,557
when they go to work,
when they leave,

465
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,491
when they're
looking at websites,

466
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,893
what kind of breaks they take.

467
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:39,064
The straight down million
timeline doesn't really work.

468
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,498
So this is a heat map.

469
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,701
And so this is kind of
like a cyclical view of it.

470
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,072
So over here on the columns
we have the hours per day,

471
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,574
so there's 23.

472
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,175
And then the rows are each
of the days of the week.

473
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,179
So again in the
intensity of the color

474
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,683
and heat map shows more
actions on one particular,

475
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,485
grid coordinate
than the other days.

476
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,122
If you look on, anybody
uses Google Analytics,

477
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,757
if you log on to your
Google Analytics dashboard,

478
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,258
there is a very
similar looking graph,

479
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,726
where it shows you how
people visit your website.

480
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,095
Like this kind of is
useful for lots of things.

481
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:14,966
And back to that, the
question I was asking,

482
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,502
how long you spend
on investigations,

483
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,770
when I was doing investigations,

484
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,137
I would like to spend as
much time as possible,

485
00:17:19,137 --> 00:17:20,672
just 'cause I kinda
like web browsers.

486
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,107
But I spend a lot of
time trying to get a feel

487
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,710
of what the person was doing,
their kind of patterns.

488
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,745
And that was more of the art,

489
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,781
there's always art versus
science in forensics.

490
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,515
And doing things like
this, we can quantify

491
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,252
and actually put data to things,

492
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,220
moves us from the
art to the science.

493
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,688
Where I just think is
where we need to go

494
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,990
to scale and be effective.

495
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,527
And again,

496
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,995
heat maps are not not
unique to this by any means.

497
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,495
This is from timesketch.

498
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,665
This is from their online
freely accessible demo.

499
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,468
You can view a timeline,
or you can click a button

500
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,271
and change it to view different
graphs and visualizations.

501
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,705
So this one has a heat map.

502
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,506
So this one, you can
very quickly see,

503
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,708
Tuesday at 11:00 there's,

504
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,910
if you care about browser stuff,

505
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,311
this is one you should look.

506
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,182
And all these summary
techniques I'm talking about,

507
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,450
are specific to web browsers

508
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,752
and this presentation,

509
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,620
but my no means are the only
relevant for web browsers.

510
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,356
So in the top here
in timesketch,

511
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,659
my search is a source
short web history.

512
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,694
Anything involves
web browsing records

513
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,964
usually changes to be failed
logins, or something like that.

514
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,365
The heat map would
be just as effective

515
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,267
at finding when things
normally happen,

516
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,170
when they don't happen, when
there's outliers and whatnot.

517
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,641
The last visualization I wanna
talk about is word clouds.

518
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,176
I really like word clouds.

519
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,412
You guys have probably seen
word clouds on blogs, right?

520
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,215
Tag clouds, those are
pretty popular things.

521
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,917
The size of the word is
proportional to its frequency,

522
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,486
so the bigger the word
is the more it appears.

523
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,456
My very first SANS
talk, I talked about,

524
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,992
I showed an example of
making a word cloud,

525
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,161
from everything in a
person's browser history.

526
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,662
It's just kind of an
interesting thing.

527
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:53,398
And I found it really, really
useful ever since then.

528
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,504
This is an example made from
the Python word cloud library.

529
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,072
You just put it
in a block of text

530
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,540
and it generates a thing.

531
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,142
There's actually even just
the default colors and values,

532
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,276
so whatever.

533
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:10,549
But this was taken from
a user's URL history.

534
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,783
It's every URL they visited,

535
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,719
it chops it up on the
different words and bam!

536
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,288
So you can kind of
quickly get a feel

537
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,223
for like what is
this person looking,

538
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,424
like maybe they're
gonna quit their job,

539
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,658
maybe they're thinking
about resigning,

540
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,594
maybe they want to write
a resignation letter.

541
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,029
So it's just, I think
it's really good

542
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,999
to get get a high-level
overview about what's going on

543
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,600
in some kind of set of evidence.

544
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,404
So this is from URLs.

545
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,572
But you can use the word cloud

546
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,072
with any kind of subset
of data you want,

547
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,074
in any kind of data.

548
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,711
This one is from
autofill records.

549
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,646
So if you type
something in Chrome,

550
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,812
it tries to help you remember

551
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,382
the form field values
that you put in.

552
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,953
This is actually from
one of the SANS images,

553
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,154
I guess not the most recent one

554
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,823
because Lee's talking
about his new one.

555
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,358
But I think it's kind of funny,

556
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,293
because you can actually see
he talked about some group.

557
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,361
All they did is try to find out

558
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,996
that probably made something.

559
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:01,233
In autofill, you can actually
see, also about Donald Blake,

560
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,467
but you can also
see Lee in there,

561
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,836
the thing is kind of funny.

562
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,341
And then this one is
search engine queries.

563
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,876
Everybody loves
search engine queries.

564
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,278
If you pull out all
the search terms,

565
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,014
you can kind of get a good feel

566
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,484
for what a person was
thinking and looking at.

567
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,718
This is actually me

568
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,554
from doing research
on building this thing

569
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,856
and other stuff in
my general work life.

570
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,992
So you can tell I'm doing some
coding, looking at pandas,

571
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,728
diagrams, dash, plotly
things like that.

572
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,097
It's just a good way to
get a high-level overview.

573
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,202
Next survey question was,

574
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,404
how do you find these
types of information?

575
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,176
Or how often do you find
these types of information,

576
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,744
excuse me.

577
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,111
So again, everybody wants
to find that smoking gun,

578
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,381
the explicit artifact
of proving their case.

579
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,018
And unsurprisingly, that doesn't
happen every single time.

580
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,854
You also might find
some bad activity,

581
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,822
but not what we're Looking for.

582
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,689
Again it's pretty common.

583
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,925
And most of time,

584
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,592
the very last one is
only non relevant data.

585
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,595
Nothing useful that thankfully,

586
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,598
for this survey was the
least common answer.

587
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,600
But the third one there
is supporting data.

588
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,002
This isn't conclusive by itself,

589
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,937
but it's really useful
supporting information.

590
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,738
This was found the most common

591
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,774
out of any of these
types of information.

592
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,542
Which makes sense, you can
find lots of really useful,

593
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,410
relevant stuff in
web browsing history,

594
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,414
related to who a person is,
what they do, where they are,

595
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,283
where they're going, things
they buy, their interest,

596
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,984
it's just, really
really helpful.

597
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,224
So supporting data is
in web browsers a lot.

598
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,958
And the nature of
supporting data

599
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,827
is that it's pretty
well understood

600
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,063
if you know what
you're looking for.

601
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,832
So if you have common questions
you're asking all the time

602
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,100
in every single investigation,

603
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,436
why not automate the way
to answer it for you?

604
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,773
This looked very on
a case-by-case basis

605
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,774
and depending on what you
find most interesting for you.

606
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,044
But there's lots of, I think
things that are pretty common,

607
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,379
that people look for in
a variety investigations,

608
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,981
regardless of the type.

609
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,217
So what types of
things do you look for?

610
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,522
Again, first results,
searches and queries.

611
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:04,456
Again, not a surprise.

612
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,690
And I'm very happy to see

613
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,526
that search engine
queries are amazing.

614
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,127
There is so much information
embedded in them.

615
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:11,663
We had a good talk from
Phil last year about that.

616
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,700
And search engine queries
are pretty well known.

617
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,301
We don't know what
every single value does

618
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,302
and how to decode
every single thing,

619
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,536
but we know a lot of them.

620
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,971
And we definitely
know the basics.

621
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,740
What's the search term, here,
browser forensics right,

622
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,574
very simple.

623
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,010
So it's very easy.

624
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,244
We understand how this is ID's,

625
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:28,612
so we can very easily
automate the extraction

626
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:30,782
of this kind of information.

627
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,818
So in Synopsis,
and general life,

628
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,654
I think I find pairing
a word cloud and a table

629
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:36,655
very helpful.

630
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,856
You can look at the word cloud

631
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,691
and kind of explore
with your eyes,

632
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,626
look where things
look interesting,

633
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,862
try to find the big
trends, the small ones,

634
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,263
and then you can use
the table next to it,

635
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,531
to search and filter

636
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,100
and find the timestamp
when a search happened

637
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,202
and the actual whole
text of the query.

638
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,670
I just find these two
pair very well together.

639
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,904
So these are included

640
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,707
in the default Synopsis
dashboard overview.

641
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,245
Back to that question.

642
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,380
The next three answers
email accounts,

643
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,183
cloud storage activity
and social media.

644
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,618
They all kind of share in common

645
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,553
the fact that you're
looking for accounts

646
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,622
that people have on services.

647
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,492
In lots of cases I had, back
when I was doing consulting,

648
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,395
you'd be interviewing
some subject

649
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,597
and they give you the two
Gmail accounts they own,

650
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,264
and then you wanna
follow up and say,

651
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,867
"Okay, is there a
hidden third one?"

652
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,335
If they're not
telling us about that

653
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,838
they used to send off some
some company IP, or whatever.

654
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,308
So getting information about
accounts that a user has

655
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:31,810
and they might have forgotten,

656
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,713
I think it's a pretty common
thing, at least in my career.

657
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,315
So again, we know
how to do this.

658
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,084
This is a thing
that happens often.

659
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,219
And so this is
specific to Chrome.

660
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,921
So there's three
places that I go to,

661
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,690
it's kind of like a go-to
for extracting information

662
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,626
about accounts people have.

663
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,094
The first one for
Chrome, is pretty easy.

664
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,695
There's a SQL database,

665
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,798
that's expressly made for
saving login credentials.

666
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,332
So if you have
accounts to things,

667
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,501
it saves your username,
your password, the domain.

668
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,069
It's super helpful,

669
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,905
So it can parse that out and
kind of put it in this card.

670
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,072
The second is autofill records.

671
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,508
So auto fill records

672
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,011
record any type of information
you store in the forms,

673
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,513
at a very high level.

674
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,282
And so it doesn't
tell you what website

675
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,649
that you logged
into, or anything.

676
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,985
Because the reason of
autofill is to identify,

677
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,053
tie the the value
with the form name,

678
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,390
So it can suggest
the same value to you

679
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,892
on a new website with
a similarly named form.

680
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,360
We can use this
to extract things

681
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,794
that are like email addresses.

682
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,063
We know what email
addresses look like.

683
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,832
We have very good ways
to automatically parse

684
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,900
and tell this is an
email address or not.

685
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,036
So you find somebody typing a
Gmail address a bunch of times

686
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,638
and autofill, there's a
pretty high likelihood

687
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,139
that they they own
that Gmail address.

688
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,708
They had access to it somehow.

689
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,143
So you use autofill for that.

690
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,544
And the third one is
you can automatically,

691
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,849
you can extract accounts
from browsing history.

692
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,917
So there's some
things like Gmail.

693
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:50,388
If you log into Gmail, it
has your your email address,

694
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,124
your Gmail address, then
a dash, then Google Mail.

695
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,392
So we know what that looks like.

696
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,861
So if you're looking
at browser history,

697
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,230
and you see the title of a
page, it's on mail.google.com,

698
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,798
you can extract
the email address

699
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,233
that they used to logged into.

700
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,002
So we can do those kind of
basic extractions automatically,

701
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,004
so we don't have to
do it manually later.

702
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,942
And so the last thing I'll
talk about on this one

703
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,677
at the very bottom there,

704
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,579
it's evidence of
other owned devices.

705
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,981
So that doesn't get a lot of,

706
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,183
it's not a frequent
investigation target,

707
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,417
but I really would encourage you

708
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,918
to take a second
thought about that

709
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,822
and look at different evidence
about having other devices.

710
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,591
So back to kind
of Lee's example,

711
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,127
and talking about even
in the survey question,

712
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:33,063
it's very very common for
people to have multiple devices.

713
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,699
And app vendors
know this, right?

714
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,768
They wanna make things as
easy to use as possible,

715
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,171
so they help sync things
back and forth all the time.

716
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,940
So, even if you
don't have the device

717
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,209
that the user performed
the activity on,

718
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,610
you might find evidence

719
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,012
that was synced to it
from another device.

720
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,513
So having all of devices

721
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,749
you can get your hands on from
a user is really important.

722
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,184
And there's some
things you would think

723
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,553
that you could expect to
find in browser history

724
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,055
about other devices.

725
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,790
and there's some stuff that
I did not expect to find,

726
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,992
which I thought was interesting.

727
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,128
And I've kind of kept this
presentation very high-level.

728
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:05,664
My other ones are more
technical than browser stuff,

729
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,198
but I'll gonna take
a little tangent,

730
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,034
because I found something
cool and I wanna show you.

731
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,069
(chuckles) So the first
one, we have Synced devices.

732
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,338
This is from the resources
synced to Chrome.

733
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,575
If you log into Chrome
with your Google account,

734
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,076
or whatever your account,

735
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,477
you can sync devices
back and forth.

736
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,946
There's a SyncData database.

737
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,547
You can find lots of
cool information there,

738
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,215
but one of the easiest
things you're going to find

739
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,386
is the names of devices
that you have synced to.

740
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,789
So here in the bottom, we
have Ryan's iPad, exaRyan

741
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,290
and desktop.

742
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,192
So that's an iPad, a Mac,
and a Windows computer.

743
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,627
So you can tell

744
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,895
I synced across these
different kinds of devices.

745
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,263
That's not breaking news,

746
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,698
We've known of that
stuff for a while.

747
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,101
The other one was
new, at least to me.

748
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,402
It's called discovered devices.

749
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,971
So this is a
chrome-specific artifact.

750
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,473
So I was looking at this

751
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,941
and I found some
cool things in there.

752
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,212
Like there's a Chromecast
for our CFO's office at work.

753
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,814
The IP address, and
the names and networks.

754
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,249
I didn't know he had that,
I've never been in his office.

755
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,319
And there's a couple of
other devices on there.

756
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,253
Google Home.

757
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,889
What is this?

758
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,626
So there's this thing called
the media router extensions,

759
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,327
built in Chrome by default.

760
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,929
And it's hidden, in the
fact that you can't,

761
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,163
if you open up the extensions,

762
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,732
you're not gonna see
media router in there,

763
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,166
but it is there.

764
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,569
And that very long string,
starting with pked,

765
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,038
is the app ID for
the media router.

766
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,539
And it's like a lot
of Chrome extensions,

767
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,076
the media router stores some
information in local storage.

768
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,245
So you look in local
storage for that app ID,

769
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,046
you'll find a lot
of information.

770
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,750
One of the more useful ones
I found is called SyncMap,

771
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,351
I think.

772
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,286
And so, I guess back a minute,

773
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,489
the reason this media
router extension exists

774
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,324
is so you can
helpfully chromecast,

775
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,626
or you can cast anything
you want from Chrome,

776
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,762
to any cast-supportable devices.

777
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,429
So the screenshot on the Left,

778
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm trying to cast
this website to my TV.

779
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,902
So cast to, it found the
TV icon, is populating it.

780
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,437
So, cool.

781
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,140
I actually found I have a TV
that could support casting.

782
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,543
And over on the right, is this
record from local storage.

783
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,412
It has the IP address of
my TV, the name of my TV,

784
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,614
the model of the TV,

785
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,782
and something you can't
see from this data,

786
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,216
but the the key above it,

787
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,950
is the name of the
network that we're on.

788
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,586
So you actually
find local devices

789
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,155
that are on the networks
where computer was

790
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,690
from your web browsing history.

791
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,892
Regardless of whether, if
you've cast it to it or not,

792
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:16,127
like I've never cast anything
to the CFO's chromecast

793
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,229
at my work, or in
that Google Home.

794
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,698
I don't know whose that is.

795
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,232
But you can still see
evidence of these devices,

796
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,368
even their IP address
from your browser history,

797
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,636
so that was pretty cool.

798
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,104
I had never, never
seen that before.

799
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,708
All right, so done with
a technical tangent.

800
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,845
So this is at the
end of my survey.

801
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,480
I want to also get a feel

802
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,950
for who you're telling
about your investigation.

803
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,487
Nobody does these
investigations for fun,

804
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,089
I guess that's not
true, I do it for fun.

805
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,657
But you know what I
mean, like your job,

806
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,826
someone's hiring you, you're
doing this for a reason.

807
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,228
So what is the technical
level of your audience?

808
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,065
It doesn't matter how
good your analysis is.

809
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,734
If the person you're
explaining it to,

810
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,202
it goes right over their
head, they have no idea,

811
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,603
you might as well not
even have done it.

812
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,738
If they didn't understand it,

813
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,272
then it was basically
wasted effort.

814
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,975
So sadly, but not surprisingly,

815
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,610
the least common
audience is someone

816
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,777
that's like like us.

817
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,446
Like a DFIR professional
that understands.

818
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,380
You can do shorthand, you
just drop some crazy acronym

819
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,649
and people know what it means,

820
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,418
that's you know not very common.

821
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,055
So you really need to
tailor your message

822
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,456
to the kind of
audience that you have.

823
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,924
In order to actually
make an impact

824
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,427
and have the effects of
your investigation be felt.

825
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,865
So pairing with this, is
how do you tell people?

826
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:27,665
The method.

827
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,170
The two most common
answers on this,

828
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,405
are either an internal
or external report,

829
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:35,340
written report, right?

830
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,941
So people don't like writing,

831
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,144
but I'm sorry writing is
an essential skill (laughs)

832
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,478
for our industry,
because if you don't,

833
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:41,679
if you can't write effectively,

834
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,481
you can't communicate
to your audience.

835
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,216
Again, you might as
well not have done it.

836
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,721
But okay, why am I
talking about this?

837
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,055
Back to the overview.

838
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,158
So this overview
isn't just this thing

839
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,125
that you should do
at the beginning

840
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,827
to save time to help you.

841
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,695
I think it also, you're
gonna throw it away

842
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,164
after you start
your investigation.

843
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:02,500
I think you can use an
overview as a starting point

844
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,569
for actually your
writing your report.

845
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,037
These same images that you used

846
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,806
to help find your first
thread in your investigation

847
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,240
or get overview on trend,

848
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,209
can be helpful for explaining
that to another person.

849
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,944
And I think pictures
and visualizations

850
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,013
are a more universal language.

851
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,715
You can show a picture
and a word cloud,

852
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,751
and people can look at it,
even if they're not technical,

853
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,586
and get an idea about, "Oh,
they're interested in this,

854
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,054
"and less interested in this."

855
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,089
It's something that people
can very easily grasp.

856
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,358
I think it makes your
report more accessible.

857
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,560
It also breaks up
your report, right?

858
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,261
So it's not just entire
paragraphs of text.

859
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,197
You can have some some catchy
images to draw people in

860
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,099
and not make them go to sleep.

861
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,769
So I think the overview,

862
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,270
you can even include
some of the information

863
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,472
from like the
extracted accounts.

864
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,441
If that's all you
wanted to know,

865
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,577
like your overview is
your entire report,

866
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,078
you just want to give me

867
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,613
all the Gmail addresses this
person owns, check done.

868
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,014
You saved a bunch of time.

869
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:55,753
So there's a lot of really
good reports out there

870
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,920
and visualizations
are becoming more

871
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,156
and more important in them.

872
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:58,990
There's a lot of really
good vendor reports,

873
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,525
like the DBIR.

874
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,026
They have whole teams of people.

875
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,095
It seems like they put this
really cool graphics together,

876
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:04,929
like an EM trends.

877
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,930
Looks really great.

878
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,100
But you don't need to have
a whole professional team

879
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,003
to make a visualization
that helps you in a report.

880
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,608
There is this report that...

881
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,010
So I was excited about
this for a few reasons.

882
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,280
First off, not a lot of forensic
reports are made public.

883
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,848
Some are, but most
of them are private

884
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,316
'cause the person
that commissioned them

885
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,784
it's sensitive, they're
going to keep to themselves.

886
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:29,287
So this is a publicly
released forensic report.

887
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,124
I'm not really gonna try
and say any names in them,

888
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,726
because this is from Norway,

889
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,828
and I would fail at saying them.

890
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,897
But the gist of
this investigation

891
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,466
was a Norwegian newspaper
got a hold of some log files

892
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,766
from a streaming service

893
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,036
and they went to a
university, NTNU,

894
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,337
say, "Can you help
us look at this?

895
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,872
"This looks odd.

896
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,707
"We think someone's monkeying
with the streaming records."

897
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,312
And the short answer
is yes, they were.

898
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,417
But this report had a lot of
math in it, a lot of stats.

899
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,784
It could have easily
been very, very dry

900
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,053
and hard to understand,

901
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:03,321
but I thought they made

902
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,254
very effective use
of visualizations.

903
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,490
If you like that kind of stuff,

904
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,158
I would encourage you to
read the whole report.

905
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,294
It's 70 pages, but 50 of it
is tables which you can skip.

906
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,362
Like tables of, yeah.

907
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:14,399
So this is an example
of visualization

908
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,266
that is not very complicated.

909
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,671
They got logged sources
from two separate days.

910
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,939
And they could have just said,

911
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,440
and in fact they did
say in a paragraph,

912
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,975
we got it from this day
range and this day range.

913
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,110
But they also included
the visualization.

914
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,147
So you very easily see where
the data is or there's a gap.

915
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,715
It's just something that
breaks up the report

916
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,050
and it's very simple to do.

917
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,551
There actually
was a fifth month,

918
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:35,586
but I truncated it so you
can see the picture better.

919
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,791
Again, with the investigation,

920
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,693
I swear I'll give you the
really short overview,

921
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,430
they thought that some
track plays were inflated

922
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,031
to basically pay some people

923
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,733
increased royalties at
the expense of others,

924
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,835
for whatever unknown reason.

925
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,603
And it was, I think,
Kanye and Beyonce,

926
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,138
were these two albums

927
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,406
that they thought they're
inflating the tracks on.

928
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,941
And this is from
one particular day

929
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,610
on the track counts for I
think one of Kanye's albums.

930
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,745
And again, they explained
all the stuff in text,

931
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,948
but you can very easily see
there's something going on here.

932
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,051
This is like every other track
record just use runs to zero.

933
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,553
It doesn't even exist anymore.

934
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,289
And you can easily see that
from the kind of records.

935
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,891
They got their point across
with this visualization.

936
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,227
The other thing is,
if you look at this,

937
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,096
do you recognize this?

938
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,364
I know if you look
at Excel a lot,

939
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,265
but I'm pretty sure
this is from Excel.

940
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,867
You don't need some
fancy expensive software,

941
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,268
and some design team.

942
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,536
You can do it with
whatever you already have.

943
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,005
It doesn't have to be flashy

944
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,306
as long as you have
the substance right

945
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,340
in the visualization.

946
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,710
This is actually my
favorite one from it.

947
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,613
They got into the details of
how the manipulation was done

948
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,515
and they found that
all these tracks,

949
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,184
there is this big
multiple of three.

950
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,786
People played three
certain tracks

951
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,421
more often like three
tracks and six tracks

952
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,856
and nine tracks
more than others.

953
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,524
Then it went to all
this the stats laws

954
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,494
about how things decay
following this curve.

955
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,695
And then they show
you this graph.

956
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,964
And so you see each
color is a day.

957
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,465
And you can see there's
only certain days

958
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,801
where there's manipulation
and it's blindingly obvious.

959
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,235
You can see if things
look artificial

960
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,737
and not natural at all.

961
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,572
And so I thought this is a
very effective visualization.

962
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,674
Again, looks like it's
made made in Excel.

963
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,514
All right, as the last
thing is writing guides.

964
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,049
I said writing is
very important.

965
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,650
Visualisations are good
start for your report,

966
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,385
but I don't think
you can get away

967
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,387
with just turning into
visualization as your answer.

968
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,989
If you can, cool
more power to you,

969
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,557
but you'll probably
have to write something.

970
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:21,658
One of my jobs, they
issued this book

971
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,627
to everyone that started.

972
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,829
The Elements of Style.

973
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:29,200
It's this tiny book, and
it's really good reference

974
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,967
for how to how to write
things using active voice,

975
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,103
all this kind of stuff.

976
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,137
So, if you're
interested in writing

977
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,405
and making writing better,

978
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,040
that's a really kind
of deep dive on it.

979
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,641
There's also a another guide

980
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:39,910
from one of the SANS
instructors, Lenny.

981
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,312
This is the entire
guide, it's one page.

982
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,147
If you want the
cliff notes version,

983
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,382
check this out, download it

984
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,384
and kind of keep your
writing a little better.

985
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,953
So yeah.

986
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,222
So an overview can save time
before an investigation.

987
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,623
I would encourage you
to use visualizations

988
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:53,825
and kind of extract the things

989
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,926
that you're always
gonna ask for.

990
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,161
And you can also use
it as a starting point

991
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,396
for your final report.

992
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,831
And I'd encourage
you to use this

993
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,200
for next time you're
doing a web investigation.

994
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,134
Just look at this,
pull up the records,

995
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:06,404
see what the
visualizations tell you.

996
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,905
I think, a lot of times

997
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,107
it's a really good place to
start pulling on a thread

998
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,374
and give you a new
idea and investigation

999
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,310
that you wouldn't have
thought of initially.

1000
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,280
Alright, that's it,
just have any questions?

1001
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,189
All right.

1002
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,424
Well, thank you.

1003
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:30,228
(audience applause)

1004
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,964
(dramatic music)
