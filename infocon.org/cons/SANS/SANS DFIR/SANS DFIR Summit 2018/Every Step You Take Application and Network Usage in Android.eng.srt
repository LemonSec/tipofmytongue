1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,104
(bright music)

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,811
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,879
- So today we're gonna
talk about Android

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,150
and how it tracks
every step you take.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,752
And we're gonna talk
about this from both

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,587
the figurative perspective,

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,690
of how Android application
usage can be tracked.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,592
And then we're gonna
get a little bit literal

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,160
and talk about some
data that Android tracks

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,730
if you happen to be
wearing, like a Fitbit,

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,433
which is literally
gonna track your steps.

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,635
I just felt like putting
that picture in there again,

13
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,269
'cause I can't
believe I found it.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,406
And something you should
know about this picture,

15
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,808
is I actually grew my
hair out for this picture.

16
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,944
I actually used to look
like Rob Lee in high school.

17
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,312
(audience laughs)

18
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,781
Woo!

19
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,582
And not something I ever
thought I would say on a stage

20
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,285
and this being
recorded! (laughs)

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,020
Anyhow,

22
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,257
so when we think about how
we've traditionally done

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,791
mobile device forensics,

24
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,460
what was always really
unique is we took

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,562
an artifact first approach.

26
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,631
And when we first started
doing this analysis

27
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,966
we looked at chat
application logs,

28
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,103
we looked at internet evidence
and web browser history.

29
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,905
But we've always
really, as an industry,

30
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,742
kind of overlooked the
file system operation.

31
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,710
So we've always taken
this web browser,

32
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,012
chat history,
email type of look.

33
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,415
But what's really
important, is to dig deeper.

34
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,452
And I know this kind of
concept is taught in Heather

35
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,955
and Lee and Cindy's
course for 585

36
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,458
and we talk about
discovering new types of apps

37
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,294
because over six million
apps on the app store,

38
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:35,728
so it's gonna be more data.

39
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:37,597
And we talk about
testing and finding

40
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,232
and parsing that data
and then writing scripts,

41
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,302
so that we know
what that data is.

42
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,705
But we don't tend to look
at the file systems as much

43
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,640
as we do in computer
investigations.

44
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:51,978
Those OS artifacts
that exist in Android,

45
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,315
can really help you timeline
things in situations

46
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,485
when other artifacts
might not exist.

47
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,754
So why can't we apply this to
our Android investigations?

48
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,289
And why would it be useful?

49
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,825
What is a couple of
reasons it'll be useful?

50
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,261
If instead, you
look at the behavior

51
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,795
of the device on the phone,

52
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:12,065
instead of the
specific user activity

53
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,001
in things like chat
applications and email.

54
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,904
You can really do a more
robust pattern of life.

55
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:19,606
When are they
plugging in the phone?

56
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,174
When are they charging down?

57
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:24,344
When are they using different
types of applications?

58
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,912
So even if you can't
recover the data

59
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,350
from a specific application
because maybe it's not stored

60
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,317
or it's in an
encrypted database.

61
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,521
Maybe you can even
find information that,

62
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,857
that application was
in use at the time.

63
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,426
So if you have a
mapping application,

64
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:41,928
that you're using
to get yourself

65
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,097
from point A to point
B, every single time.

66
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,167
And that application
stores it's data

67
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,471
in an encrypted database,
so you can't get timestamps.

68
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,740
What if you can at
least prove the times

69
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,942
in which that
application is being used

70
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,677
and travel is taking place?

71
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:02,048
You can also use this to
show a lack of activity.

72
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,651
These are sometimes the
hardest cases we get

73
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,886
and all of the data I'm
gonna talk about today,

74
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,555
I've learned in research

75
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,990
from assisting other
people with their cases.

76
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,361
There was once this
instance where,

77
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,596
there was an incident
with a driver

78
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,600
who was being accused
of wrongful actions

79
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,036
of talking on his phone,
texting while driving.

80
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,239
And the people I was assisting
with this case could find

81
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,342
no indicative of evidence
of the communication.

82
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,945
CDRs didn't show
any text messages,

83
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,914
data on the phone didn't
show any chat communication.

84
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,350
So they asked what to do,

85
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,385
there weren't any applications
that appeared in usage.

86
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,521
So I started looking
through the device,

87
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,422
to figure out how we could track

88
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,825
the file system activity
of what's on the device

89
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:48,795
and that's kind of what
we're gonna talk about.

90
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:52,097
This is also really good
when you have sync'd data.

91
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,500
Now that we have data in lots
of different applications,

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,669
a lot of Google
applications, et cetera,

93
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:00,306
that syncs between the
cloud, the device, computers,

94
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,042
all using the same system,
sometimes it's artifacts

95
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,345
are persistent across
multiple devices.

96
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,047
And one of the
challenges is determining

97
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:10,817
which device created
the artifact.

98
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,152
Was this actually
created on the phone,

99
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,620
which was in your possession?

100
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,257
Or somebody else logged
in on your home computer

101
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,792
with the same account,
who wasn't you?

102
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,594
So one of the ways we can do
this is by actually looking

103
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,098
at the activity on the
Android device at the time.

104
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,368
We gotta start at the beginning

105
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,670
of when an application
is installed.

106
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,107
And a lot of people tend to
look at com.vending.android

107
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,808
and I'm gonna specify here

108
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,611
that when I'm looking at
devices installed on a device,

109
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:43,182
I actually don't use
this particular location.

110
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:47,620
I tend to use packages that
XML or packages that list

111
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,389
and I'm gonna clarify one thing,

112
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,491
all of these artifacts,
physical image,

113
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,092
none of these are
backed up in a logical.

114
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,096
This database lies.

115
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,499
Okay?

116
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,801
We're looking at Twitter
here, just a mention,

117
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,568
we're gonna be looking at
Twitter throughout this.

118
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,538
We've got a timestamp, I'm
gonna tell you why it lies.

119
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:08,541
There's two instances where
this database is gonna lie.

120
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,810
Number one,

121
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,079
if you have more
than one user account

122
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,782
on the Android device,
which you can have,

123
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,185
it will take applications
from one user

124
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:23,089
and add them to the other
user's application database.

125
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,758
So in the database, it actually
tells you a user's name

126
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,161
in the application they
duplicate across both,

127
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,829
even if the second
user never installed

128
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,297
or purchased the application,

129
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,734
even if they have two unique
Gmail, Google accounts.

130
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,138
The second one, is when
you get a new device.

131
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,541
So when you get a new
or a second device

132
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,546
and you start putting in
your account on that device,

133
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,581
if you do not download
all of the apps

134
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,849
that you've previously had,

135
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,418
it will still give
the impression

136
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,321
that you had that
application installed

137
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,557
when it was never
installed on that device.

138
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,926
These are the kinds of things
you need to take into account

139
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,426
when you're doing your testing.

140
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,565
Especially on Android now,
with CE and DE storage,

141
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,266
with the credential
encrypted storage,

142
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,169
please ensure that you're
testing with multiple devices,

143
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,840
on a device and then always
also checking what happens

144
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,542
when you take that account and
move it to a second device.

145
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,312
If you don't, you may not know

146
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,414
where those artifacts
actually originated.

147
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,053
One of my favorite artifacts
in this research is usagestats.

148
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,691
Usagestats actually tells
you what application

149
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,960
is in the foreground

150
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,195
and what applications
are in the background.

151
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,133
Whoa, I now know
exactly what application

152
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,601
is showing on the screen.

153
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,236
It actually stores these in a

154
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,070
daily, weekly, monthly
and yearly folder

155
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,341
and these are in XML folders
with an epoch timestamp.

156
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,544
There's actually robust
documentation on this,

157
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,914
this is not something the
poor Apple people see often.

158
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,985
Android has done good,
robust documentation on this

159
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,088
and there is four reasons
that you wind up with this.

160
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,322
When something moves
to the background

161
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,991
when something moves
to the foreground,

162
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,527
when it's configured and when
there's any user interaction.

163
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,163
That's pretty valuable.

164
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,833
So now I know exactly
what application was
on the top screen

165
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,535
while the device was being used.

166
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,270
This is what that
usagestats looks like,

167
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,540
don't worry I know you
can't see it. (laughs)

168
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,377
So it's an XML and in
here you have a timestamp,

169
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,312
as well as the application name.

170
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,449
Battery stats.

171
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,352
This is the SRUM,
kind of, of Android.

172
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,921
So the purpose of this and the
reason you're gonna use this,

173
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,491
is you're gonna see when
the device is in use

174
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,026
because you're gonna
get a timestamp

175
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,595
and what's really interesting
is that you get that

176
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,064
requires charging so you know
if the device has been being

177
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,301
used a lot and got down
to that 15% or lower.

178
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,938
Now, speaking of
battery time stamps,

179
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:55,041
I love me some
BatterystatsDumpsysTask.

180
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,343
So it's a really,
really long name

181
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,745
but there is something
really important in here.

182
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:04,350
You get this file and
you've got these UIDs

183
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,118
and these package names.

184
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,355
These UIDs are gold because
you are gonna use these

185
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,857
to correlate everything.

186
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,159
And so you literally
have a list here,

187
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,428
of all the applications
and these UIDs,

188
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,430
these UIDs follow throughout.

189
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,532
Really, really weird 'cause
it's only five digits

190
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,567
and we normally don't
think of unique identifiers

191
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,702
of being that short.

192
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,372
Let's go onto some other
artifacts and tie that back.

193
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,641
Remember, there'll
be a quiz later.

194
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,209
I'm joking. (laughs)

195
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,677
(audience laughs)

196
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,712
So if you go to recent
images, what's really cool

197
00:08:33,712 --> 00:08:37,516
is these recent images are
actually the activity icon

198
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,087
for the images that
were last used.

199
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,990
When you go into these, these
actually have MAC times,

200
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,826
but it's this number right here.

201
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:47,693
Woo!

202
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:48,828
That's really important.

203
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,097
This is your task ID.

204
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,899
Okay, so we've got two
things going on now,

205
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,367
UIDs and task IDs.

206
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,301
This task ID of 244,

207
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,339
that is always gonna be
for the same application.

208
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:06,178
Then right here, we actually
have our epoch timestamp.

209
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,148
So moving on, we can see
exactly when this was created

210
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,449
on Friday May 11th.

211
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,251
Great, let's move on.

212
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,021
So now we know Twitter, 'cause
we saw that picture, right?

213
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:15,854
Doop doop.

214
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:17,890
Right there?

215
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,258
Was being used at that time.

216
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,496
Alright, so, now we're
gonna move to recent tasks.

217
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,331
Remember, this is all
gonna tie together.

218
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,835
Recent tasks, is gonna
go ahead and take, boop

219
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,306
take that same task ID,

220
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,042
give you timestamps for the
recent times it's been used

221
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,643
but then as an XML document.

222
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,779
And when you open up
this XML document,

223
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,447
guess what's in there?

224
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,882
That UID!

225
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,883
So now you know, not
just by the picture,

226
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,485
because maybe that icon is false

227
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,888
and it's an application
posing as another application.

228
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,390
But you actually have
that effective UID,

229
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,192
so now I know this is Twitter.

230
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,462
So now I've tied
each of those images

231
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,698
of the activity icon
from the recent tasks,

232
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,334
which is all unique
openings of the application.

233
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:06,238
To the UID, which I found in
the battery stats dump manager.

234
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,808
And then I'm able to
coordinate that, to this.

235
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,211
Which I get a first active
time, I get a last active time

236
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,280
and I get a last time moved.

237
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,115
So this means I
can actually know

238
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,417
that all of these things
belong to Twitter.

239
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,152
But wait, there's more.

240
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,420
So, (laughs)

241
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,589
If I go to snapshots,
in the system_ce 0,

242
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,858
which this is great,

243
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,526
'cause system_ce is
credentialed storage.

244
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,429
Which means if there
are multiple users,

245
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,698
the 0 directory is
gonna be the first user,

246
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:36,669
10's gonna be second user,
11's gonna be third user.

247
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:41,073
I am going to get
a picture, a JPG,

248
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,975
with that same number: 244.

249
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,945
244 we know is the task ID for?

250
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:46,846
Twitter!

251
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,481
So, (laughs)

252
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,150
I get this JPG
and I look at this

253
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,752
and it's actually
what was on the screen

254
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,320
at the last time that
application was used.

255
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,823
This wouldn't have been
been recovered anywhere else

256
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,326
because this is not a DM,

257
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,095
this is not a Twitter post.

258
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,897
This is an actual view
of just an account,

259
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,499
this doesn't reside
anywhere else.

260
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,734
But now I know exactly what
activity was on the screen

261
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,302
the last time Twitter was used.

262
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,906
Also 3rd party apps,

263
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,275
they also have robust logs

264
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,310
and I wanna mention the Cheetah
mobile apps for a moment

265
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,512
'cause they're some of the
most ubiquitous that are used.

266
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,516
Over forty million
downloads of the current

267
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,550
Cheetah mobile app
that's on the Play store

268
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,819
because Cheetah mobile apps

269
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,753
are constantly taken
off the Play store.

270
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,824
So these track two main
things you're gonna look at,

271
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,859
the main process log and
the performance metrics log.

272
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,931
In the app lock log,
when you look at this,

273
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,467
it actually tells you
exactly what the top app was

274
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,002
'cause it's doing
application lock

275
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,170
so it always needs to
know what application

276
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,373
moved to the foreground,
gives you a time stamp,

277
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,443
gives you the application
based on package name.

278
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,112
They also have that
performance metrics reports,

279
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,546
this is actually
going to give you

280
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,250
even more robust
information about exactly

281
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,319
what's going on
with your battery.

282
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,154
I do not know and I
haven't determined yet

283
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,956
the process IDs
and feature masks

284
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,224
but you're getting the timestamp

285
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,626
and how much usage is
going on at that time,

286
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,728
as well as the battery
drainage percentage is

287
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
at that timestamp.

288
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,500
Of course, we also need to
look at what's in the cloud

289
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,569
because Google Cloud now
tracks your activity.

290
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,570
Ironically, this is actually
the same location that

291
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,273
Phil Moore just mentioned in
his Google Home presentation

292
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,175
for where you actually
find home data.

293
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,376
Well guess what?

294
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,679
It actually tracks every
application you use.

295
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,548
So using Takeout, you
can make a download

296
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,217
and if you go to
the Android folder,

297
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,818
open this up in you browser,

298
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,420
you're actually gonna
see your last couple

299
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,655
of application usage.

300
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,159
So for example, here's that
exact time or another exact time

301
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,561
when Twitter was being used.

302
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,598
Now, a user can determine
whether or not this is saved,

303
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,334
you can actually turn this
off, it's on by default,

304
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,901
it's under web app and activity

305
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,104
and here's where you
can change that setting.

306
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,107
So looking at Google
Cloud activity,

307
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,077
you can actually see the last
couple of things I've searched

308
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,945
and you can see this
nice and easily,

309
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,580
just by logging
into the account.

310
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,385
Alright, so when you put this
all together, without having

311
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,790
any regular typical
artifacts parsed,

312
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,224
that would have been parsed by
any of your commercial tools

313
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,961
that show things normally
like chat, browser history,

314
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,696
downloads, et cetera.

315
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,466
I can actually see
the exact times

316
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,934
that Twitter was being used.

317
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,004
Let's talk about the literal.

318
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,539
Steps.

319
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,074
Alright, so what about when
you're running a Fitbit app?

320
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:32,511
And this was actually
inquired about

321
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,615
at the end of Heather and
Sarah's talk yesterday,

322
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,818
about the iOS health UB.

323
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,220
So now we're gonna
get a little bit

324
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,222
on the Android side
and talk about steps.

325
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,524
But first, why's it important?

326
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,794
You all know the background
information, they recently,

327
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,728
they acquired Pebble
a couple of years ago

328
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,997
and Vector Watch SRL.

329
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,199
So they're becoming very
prominent in the space.

330
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,368
But Fitbit has been
used as evidence

331
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,537
in investigations before.

332
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,874
It was used in a rape case
where a woman claimed falsely

333
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:06,745
that her boss had let her stay
at his house, she was asleep

334
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,382
and while asleep, he came back
into the house and raped her.

335
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,818
As it turned out, she was
wearing a Fitbit at the time

336
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,487
and at the times in which
she claimed she was asleep,

337
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,857
the Fitbit showed activity of
her actually walking around

338
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,425
the house and she was
trashing the scene.

339
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,195
Another instance has to
do from a civil case,

340
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,598
where a gentleman was
taking workman's comp,

341
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,665
who was a physical
fitness trainer.

342
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,402
And in this instance
because he was a trainer,

343
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,637
he was kinda active.

344
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,006
They actually used his
Fitbit data to prove

345
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,040
that he was exerting more,

346
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,910
performing regular
fitness routines,

347
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,812
than could have ever been done,

348
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,748
had he actually had
the actual injury.

349
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,551
But really recently in
March, there was actually

350
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,355
a really big case
surrounding Fitbit data.

351
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,359
This poor woman,
Nicole VanderHyden was
murdered gruesomely,

352
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,494
strangled by George Burch.

353
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,664
And George claimed there was
a lot of evidence against him,

354
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,966
there was Google Dash evidence

355
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,402
that proved he had
been at the scene.

356
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,171
And he said he wasn't
responsible for the murder

357
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,942
because Nicole's
live-in boyfriend,

358
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,211
had actually forced him
to commit the murder.

359
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,579
And he did it, not to commit it

360
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,513
but was with him at
the time of the murder,

361
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,217
forced him to be
there under duress.

362
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,754
Well, fortunately for
the accused gentleman,

363
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,456
he was sleeping and
wearing a Fitbit.

364
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,558
And what's interesting
is he actually got up

365
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,561
to go to the bathroom
between 4 a.m. and 4:30

366
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,731
and that Fitbit, was his alibi

367
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,033
and he was exonerated.

368
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,869
So let's talk about the
kinda data you can get.

369
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:37,970
Well, the first
thing you can get

370
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,638
is some data about the profile.

371
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,840
And that data is gonna
include the user ID,

372
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,243
full name and a
profile imagine URL,

373
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,578
as well as some information
that the user inputs

374
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,314
such as height and
gender, birthdate.

375
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,051
That, from there, it
determines your stride length.

376
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,219
This is actually
really important

377
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,389
because the stride length
is user configurable.

378
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,892
So when this gentleman
was being exonerated,

379
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,461
I actually applaud
the police department,

380
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,331
you can put a profile picture
anything you want, right?

381
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,967
(sighs) The reason I really
applaud the police department

382
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,069
is because the stride
length is determined

383
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:13,204
by what people put in and
because you can adjust it

384
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,907
using the information
at this URL.

385
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,610
The police department had
him put back on the Fitbit

386
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,213
and had him take the
same number of steps,

387
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,117
that were claimed in the
case to actually determine

388
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,584
if the stride length matched.

389
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,222
So, speaking of which,
we've got steps.

390
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,223
And so what's really
interesting about steps,

391
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,459
is if you notice here,

392
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,960
these are always in
15 minute increments.

393
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,330
You'll notice I stated
that the gentlemen who was

394
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,800
exonerated got up
between 4 and 4:30,

395
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,801
the reason is 'cause steps
were registered between

396
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:48,807
4 and 4:15 a.m. as well as
between 4:15 a.m. and 4:30.

397
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,176
But what's really,
really fascinating here,

398
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,512
even though it's only
15 minute increments,

399
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,483
is the data from the
profile was actually used

400
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,053
to go back to Fitbit and
Fitbit cooperated and provided

401
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,888
a spreadsheet log
of the information

402
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,857
of the steps taken
during the period.

403
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,560
And that evidence, was
actually to the minute.

404
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,131
So, it definitely corroborated
but it was interesting

405
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:18,137
that the data that Fitbit has
is actually much more precise

406
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:19,771
than what's stored in the DB.

407
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:23,274
But this is great evidence
as far as showing someone's

408
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,812
activity or proving that
they weren't doing something.

409
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,513
And again, these
steps that were taken

410
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:29,982
in the false rape case,

411
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,451
actually proved that she
was awake and moving around

412
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,020
during a time she
claimed to be sleeping.

413
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,189
This can be presence
or lack of movement.

414
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,390
Floors climbed.

415
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,626
What's interesting
about floors climbed

416
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,228
is as you see these
are on a per day basis.

417
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,198
So way, not very granular here.

418
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,867
But again, what you're gonna
be able to use this information

419
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:52,137
for is tracking someone's
activity over time.

420
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,639
So, (laughs)

421
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,942
dragging a body, might not
give you a precise time,

422
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,977
when you're talking here.

423
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,946
Fitbit also tracks
your heart rate.

424
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,449
It's gonna be a
periodic heart rate,

425
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,718
these are done in five
minute increments.

426
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,821
It is constant throughout.

427
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,658
So you'll be able to
map over time exactly

428
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,360
where those average
periodic heart rates are.

429
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,562
This can be useful
as a great indication

430
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,864
of physical exertion.

431
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,666
Not using Fitbit,
but a pacemaker,

432
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,168
there was a case out of the
UK where heart rate was used

433
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,773
to determine that a
gentleman actually

434
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,809
had not been woken up by a fire

435
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,212
because his heart
rate did not spike

436
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,681
and he had a pacemaker and
it would have been too much

437
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,983
physical exertion
for him to remove

438
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,753
as many pieces of evidence
from the property, as he did.

439
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:46,091
So looking at a spike, can show
that somebody was surprised

440
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,926
or they were nervous, et cetera.

441
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,160
Sleep.

442
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,296
So sleep is often
contested in court,

443
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,132
the sleep data being
recorded from Fitbit.

444
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,900
And this is actually
pretty intriguing

445
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,835
because I did mention
somebody was exonerated

446
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,303
because they were sleeping.

447
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,873
They weren't because a Fitbit
said they were sleeping,

448
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,308
it's because they had the
movement during the period

449
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,678
and it was not enough movement
to have committed the murder.

450
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,716
So in this instance, you'll
see that there's a time in bed,

451
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,950
a time awake and a time asleep.

452
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,554
I believe this may be to help

453
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:19,057
with certain health
issues like sleep apnea

454
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,561
but it is not been
considered relevant

455
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,664
in courts and there's actually
been some contestation

456
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,300
of actually relying on this.

457
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,769
However, the fact that the
device was not in the mode

458
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,071
to record sleep during
the false rape case,

459
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,673
was actually also brought up.

460
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,778
Well thank you so much, this
has been a true pleasure.

461
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,781
(audience applauds)

462
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,252
(intense percussive music)
