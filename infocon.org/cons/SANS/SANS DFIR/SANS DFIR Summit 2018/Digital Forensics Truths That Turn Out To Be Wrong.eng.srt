1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,503
(soft electronica music)

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,979
(audience applause)

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:17,450
- When I was thinking
about my talk this year

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,054
it was at a time when I had
just left law enforcement

5
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:26,058
after 31 years doing
things a certain way,

6
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,063
a certain number of
times over and over again

7
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:34,034
and I crawled out of my
law enforcement bubble

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,271
and looked at the universe
around me and realized

9
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,707
that there was some really
different things out there

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,775
outside law enforcement.

11
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,076
Now, I had always known this.

12
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,712
This wasn't a surprise,
but from the perspective

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,280
of law enforcement
I always thought

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,182
we've got all these rules
we need to operate under.

15
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,052
Sometimes we've got
advantages with those rules,

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,354
but all those folks on
a private sector side

17
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:57,589
they have so many more
possibilities than we have,

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,761
and so once I was out of
that law enforcement bubble

19
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:06,599
I looked around and I said,
"Holy cow, nothing is like

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,168
I thought it was gonna be."

21
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,270
So, this is me.

22
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,907
I am the president of
Gillware Digital Forensics.

23
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,442
It's been two years already,

24
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,011
it doesn't feel like
it's even been a year.

25
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,648
I'm really enjoying the
private sector a whole lot

26
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,451
and still am working a
lot with law enforcement

27
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,821
but am branching
out into civil cases

28
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,258
and different opportunities.

29
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,161
So, I was a cop for 31 years.

30
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:39,165
I can't say that I truly
miss it, I miss the people.

31
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,501
I don't particularly
miss the work.

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,206
(chuckles) But I'm also very
willing to help law enforcement

33
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:50,510
with their work if
it is needed so...

34
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,648
Anyway, I also got my masters
degree at University College

35
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,750
in Dublin which, if there are
any other graduates out there,

36
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:02,388
we should get together at
a break and compare notes.

37
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,823
Great program out there.

38
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:07,460
And finally, one of my
biggest influence in forensics

39
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:11,197
has been working with
Heather and Lee, co-author

40
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:15,034
and teach the 585 Advanced
Smartphone Forensics course.

41
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,769
I started this back in
my law enforcement days

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,240
and have continued to
work on that course

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,376
and have loved working
with Heather and Lee

44
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,480
because we're always
doing new things.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,381
I think throughout this
conference we've heard

46
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,218
about the pace of change,
the number of artifacts,

47
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,953
new/different artifacts,

48
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,389
not knowing how to
fully parse something,

49
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,225
not knowing what
an artifact means.

50
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,795
When you're knee deep in the
cellphone forensics world,

51
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:45,899
that is your everyday life.

52
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:50,637
So, you have to learn really
quickly to work things out

53
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,572
or to figure out what
you can figure out

54
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,908
and save in your memory banks

55
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,844
what you haven't figured
out yet for the future

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,914
'cause at some point we
come across solutions.

57
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,950
So, I wanna talk
to you today about

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,219
what I'm gonna call
ground truth, right.

59
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:11,191
The ideas, the assumptions, the
knowledge we all start from.

60
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,096
What we see through empirical
observation in our daily jobs,

61
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,899
what we consider to be
the fundamental truth,

62
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,902
the way things are and
how that can kind of get

63
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:27,506
in our way in forensics and
internet response of seeing

64
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,213
how things really
are because sometimes

65
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:37,684
those assumptions come at
us and we believe them more

66
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,921
than we believe what we're
actually seeing in our labs.

67
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,822
So, I'm gonna talk about a
few things and I wanna start

68
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,793
with an oldie but
a goodie: imaging.

69
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,028
And then I wanna talk
about firmware and hardware

70
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:52,298
because we largely
ignore those things

71
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,567
until recently, right.

72
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,037
There's been a little
kerfuffle about firmware

73
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,007
and it's died down a
little bit but the problem

74
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,709
is still fundamentally there,

75
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,012
and I wanna talk about
hardware because we make a lot

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,982
of assumptions about hardware
that aren't necessarily true.

77
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,853
Then I wanna talk about,
hey, you know, for 31 years

78
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,623
I was testifying in court, 17
of those were in forensics,

79
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,625
I was, like, I swear that
I'm telling you the truth,

80
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,227
the whole truth,
nothing but the truth,

81
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,999
and then I find out
later I was wrong, right.

82
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,502
What do we do about it and
how do we keep moving forward

83
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,871
if we get stuck to
these assumptions

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,308
that kind of hold our
field back in someways.

85
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,112
How do we correct those
truths and how do we make sure

86
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,683
that it's not affecting, you
know, somebody's livelihood

87
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:47,053
through the civil side
or someone's lifetime

88
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,888
through the criminal side.

89
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:52,358
So, Oscar Wilde, a
hero of mine once said,

90
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,162
"The pure and simple truth is
rarely pure and never simple."

91
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,666
I think that could be an
alternate title to my talk.

92
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,200
Gerald, where are you?

93
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,337
I don't know if Gerald's
in the room anymore

94
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,374
but he should
recognize this picture.

95
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:12,178
This is Giant Jenga from
a couple of years ago.

96
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:17,183
He and I had an ongoing,
I guess, competition.

97
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,087
This is the perfect game of
Jenga, if you'll notice, right.

98
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,390
You can't do anything
more than that.

99
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,592
Notice how the base is steady.

100
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,094
At the top we start to
tumble a little bit, right.

101
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,866
This is a great analogy 'cause
when you're doing forensics

102
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,869
on the cutting edge, when
you're doing new things,

103
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,839
new research, testing
the boundaries

104
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,975
of what we already know and
trying to discover new things,

105
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,778
you often find yourself
there at the top of the pile

106
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:49,248
trying to balance and
not slide off, okay.

107
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,817
I'm glad we captured this image

108
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,819
because it was a
great moment in time

109
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,120
and a really good analogy.

110
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,724
So, imaging...

111
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,426
How many people in the room
are still under the belief

112
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,628
that when you hook a hard drive,

113
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,832
let's go with a traditional
spinning hard drive

114
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,802
up to a write blocker
and you image that

115
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,572
with forensic software that
you're getting every bit of data

116
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,674
from the first to the last

117
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,810
and that's the full physical
image that you're working with.

118
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,912
How many people have ever
written that in a report?

119
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,914
I have. C'mon, be proud.

120
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,183
It's good, it's what
we were all taught,

121
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,452
National White
Collar Crime Center,

122
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,221
doesn't matter where
you were taught, right.

123
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,557
They said when you hook
this up to this device

124
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,427
it prevents data from gettin'
written back to the drive,

125
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,729
your software can address
first bit to last bit,

126
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,897
you're getting
every piece of data

127
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,867
and you now have a
full image to work with

128
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,136
and that's forensically
sound, okay.

129
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,375
So, in 2012, and we
end up with this nice--

130
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,812
this is, you know, FTK Imager
on one of the Sans images.

131
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,148
We get this nice
report that says,

132
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,217
yes, our hash values
match, everything is cool.

133
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,789
So, for years we have
operated under the assumption

134
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,024
that we're gettin' everything
there is to get, right?

135
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,759
Like, there's nothing
else beyond that

136
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,096
and if it doesn't exist in that
it's not part of our image.

137
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,101
Problem is, is that that's
not true and in 2012

138
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,272
we had a bunch of
people come out

139
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,774
and say, hey, you
know, what about all

140
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,944
of the system service
areas, what about the areas

141
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,547
of hard drive that
are owned, right.

142
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,916
Like, blockers are telling us,

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,552
hey, there's six
power cycles there.

144
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,554
There's seven starts and stops,

145
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,056
here's the serial
number for the drive.

146
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,692
Like, if I did a search
across that physical image,

147
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,694
would I come up with
that serial number?

148
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:43,996
What if I didn't?

149
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,732
Where is the write blocker
getting that from, right.

150
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,203
Like, if that's not
in my physical image.

151
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,041
So, at the bottom there's a
reference there but there's,

152
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,744
you know, from 2012 we've
known this and the thing is

153
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,646
we've moved forward
through time,

154
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,649
just kinda gone
la-la-la-la-la (laughs),

155
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,486
and when I came into
the data recovery world

156
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:13,426
I realized that data
recovery really looks deeply

157
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:18,197
at these service areas: the
smart area and the reserved area

158
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,534
and all of that
servo information
and it's looking for,

159
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,971
hey, where has this data
been, how was it arranged,

160
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,806
what blocks are good,
what blocks are bad,

161
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,274
is there something
that we can do

162
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,878
to look at those other areas
and grab that data back.

163
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:34,613
And then we've got the
host protected area.

164
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,518
We've got DCO, our tools
now account for all of that

165
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,720
and we've got this
question of firmware.

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,088
Where does that live, right?

167
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,622
Like, where does that
live in our systems

168
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,360
and are we addressing it or
even considering it in our exam.

169
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,664
So these screenshots are
actually from an actual case,

170
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,566
employee data theft.

171
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:58,571
Guy turns in his computer,
no data left on the device.

172
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,707
We go to image the hard
drive and we're like, wait,

173
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,644
what hard drive from a person
who's worked for a company

174
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:09,649
for 10 years has only
been cycled six or
seven times, right.

175
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,450
This is the old switcheroo.

176
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,686
Like, we could do whatever
we wanted on this drive

177
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,988
but it was brand
new out of the box,

178
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,759
swapped with the hard drive
that had the information on it

179
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,495
that the guy didn't
wanna turn in

180
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,798
and we're never gonna
find data on this drive

181
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,401
because it never
existed here, okay.

182
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,604
He had sworn in court that
he had turned in everything,

183
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:37,176
so he had some explaining to
do in this particular case.

184
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,313
But if we don't look at
this we're never gonna see

185
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,847
that simple answer, right.

186
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,851
Like, his actual hard drive
had about 27 thousand starts

187
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,055
and stops and that makes
a whole lot more sense

188
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,290
as far as simple
answers are concerned.

189
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:58,431
So another set of myths
is about firmware.

190
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,536
I will admit to you that
I have thought very little

191
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,505
about firmware in
my career, okay.

192
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:10,610
Very, very little and in the
last two years I've thought

193
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,313
about firmware a whole
lot because it matters.

194
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:19,318
I used to think, hey, as long
as it's not malfunctioning,

195
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,754
as long as that phone
isn't in a boot loop.

196
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,591
If it's working,
what does it matter.

197
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,027
In reality it really
matters, right.

198
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,363
Like, Intel's now
finding this out

199
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,467
and the second part
of this becomes well,

200
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,069
hey, if we as the forensics
community aren't thinking

201
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,738
about firmware maybe it
really doesn't matter

202
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,376
because it's so
esoteric and so weird

203
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,846
that nobody really is gonna
mess with the firmware.

204
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,048
Well, firmware's
everywhere, right.

205
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,818
Like, if you've ever had
a cable box in the 80s

206
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,920
and flashed that cable box

207
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,455
so that you could get
those channels illegally,

208
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,325
you were messing
with the firmware.

209
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,928
And, farmers, American farmers
are messing with the firmware

210
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,965
in their tractors, they're
re-flashing their tractors

211
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,901
in order to repair their
tractors on their own

212
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,037
or to go to a third party
to repair the tractors

213
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,274
both out of convenience
and out of cost.

214
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,711
So farmers are doing it, we
do it with our cable boxes,

215
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,547
we do it with our phones if
we're flashing our phones

216
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,715
or rooting our phones.

217
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,352
It's not particularly
hard to do,

218
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,120
it doesn't take a lot
of technical knowledge.

219
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,291
There's a lot of
instructions out there.

220
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,327
Another great example
of this is USB drives.

221
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,132
One major source of business
for the data recovery side

222
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:44,737
of Gillware is a
number of USB drives

223
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,338
that are always sent in to us.

224
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,373
The customer says I brought

225
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:53,145
this 128 gigabyte hard drive,

226
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,715
it's a USB drive on Amazon.

227
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,917
I got it for 18 bucks.

228
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,487
I put, like, 18 gigabytes
of pictures on it

229
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,355
and I don't know
where they all went.

230
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,126
Well, someone has
re-flashed the firmware,

231
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:10,129
counterfeited that thumb
drive to make it appear

232
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:15,134
to be larger than it is and
their files were too big

233
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,536
to fit on that drive and never
made it to the drive, okay.

234
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,806
So, this is something
that I saw once

235
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,908
in my law enforcement
career but I see over

236
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,445
and over again coming through
the data recovery company.

237
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,914
We got someone laughing,
maybe you had (laughs)

238
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,418
this experience, but
it is very common.

239
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,654
We have tons and tons of
counterfeited USB devices

240
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,625
out there being sold for cheap
on Amazon or wherever else,

241
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:46,132
and USB-- sorry, firmware
based systems are everywhere.

242
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,603
Any embedded system is going
to have firmware; keyboards,

243
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,574
webcam, sound cards, cellphones,
audio recorders, smart TVs,

244
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,511
digital cameras, all
of these things operate

245
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,280
based on the firmware.

246
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,382
So, if we can hack that
firmware, change that firmware,

247
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,020
we can change what
that thing thinks it is

248
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,625
or what it thinks it's supposed
to do or we can make areas

249
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,694
for data to be stored that
wouldn't necessarily be there,

250
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,365
or we can do some
other things like...

251
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,400
Let's see, from a
forensics standpoint.

252
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,403
We look at USB store
in the registry

253
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,971
to see unique serial numbers

254
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,808
for devices, right, USB devices.

255
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,710
What if I could
make 50 USB drives

256
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,414
that all had the same
unique serial number.

257
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,217
Would that pose some problem
from a forensic standpoint?

258
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,886
Okay, there might
be ways around this.

259
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,421
Everybody's thinkin' okay,
how would I recognize that?

260
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,491
This is good, this is
what I'm trying to get you

261
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,994
to think about because these
possibilities are out there

262
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,530
and we're actively
seeing them in casework

263
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,798
and the potential for them.

264
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:55,734
So, firmware matters.

265
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,404
Firmware can be
easily exploited.

266
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:03,275
Anybody ever work on a
firmware exploitation case?

267
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:08,614
Anybody working any cases
involving Intel, chipsets

268
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,282
and messing with that firmware.

269
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,817
You're not gonna say who you are

270
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,521
if you are (laughs) probably,
but it is an issue out there.

271
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,959
Firmware is easily exploited,
it's not protected very well,

272
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,460
it's not meant for security.

273
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:23,996
We can think about
Meltdown and Spectre,

274
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,199
we can think about the AMT
firmware vulnerability,

275
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,669
active management technology.

276
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,606
If we open up the firmware

277
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,545
box here we can change
all sorts of things about

278
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,146
that device even if the
device is off, right,

279
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:46,485
which is why this is kind
of a scary new territory

280
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,020
that we're walking into.

281
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,758
But from another standpoint,
firmware is really helpful.

282
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:57,763
If we're able to write custom
firmware for flash memory

283
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,766
we can do some things to
access and deal with data

284
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,769
that otherwise we might not be
able to access and deal with.

285
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,038
And phones, if we
have that phone

286
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,539
that's stuck in a boot loop,

287
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,742
if we have that phone that
we can't get to turn on

288
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,213
sometimes custom firmware
is the answer and,

289
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:18,150
by the way, our forensics
tools are doing this

290
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,288
in order to give us access
to some of the phone.

291
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:26,091
So those custom firmware
solutions are out there.

292
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,497
So it can help us, it can
also cause some scary things

293
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:36,468
but we certainly shouldn't
be, you know, sittin' there

294
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,737
with our blinders on in the
forensics world deciding

295
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,473
that firmware doesn't
matter especially because

296
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,310
if farmer's can flash the
firmware on their tractors,

297
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,045
really, anybody can flash
their firmware on anything

298
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,515
and there are lots of
exploits out there.

299
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,887
Another set of myths
has to do with hardware.

300
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,457
In my mind was, hey, as
long as the hardware works

301
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,526
that's cool, we're
gonna get what we need.

302
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,194
In reality the
hardware can matter.

303
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,732
Again, with phones sometimes
we're able to do some things

304
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,935
with hardware to short out
things in order to gain access

305
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:14,073
to phones that otherwise
we can't get access to.

306
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,108
So that's a direct
hardware exploit.

307
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:21,180
And again, with
hardware, USB drives,

308
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,084
we can make the assumption
that under the covers

309
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:29,088
if we buy a whole lot of
the same kind of USB drive

310
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,956
they're going to be
exactly the same.

311
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,228
Right, so this is leftovers
from yesterday but we have,

312
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,897
you know, six identical-looking
thumb drives on the outside.

313
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,534
We assume that the hardware
in here is the same.

314
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,572
I'm here to tell you
that the hardware

315
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,709
that gets used in these is
not high quality, right.

316
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,343
It can be factory seconds.

317
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:57,349
It can be, you know, the
extras at the end of a run.

318
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,986
We recently-- I don't have
the picture in my slides,

319
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:04,556
but we recently came
across two PNY thumb drives

320
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,360
that have the same chip
as the iPhone 6 in them

321
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,529
and it was just glued
right to the board,

322
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,665
and when the guys
in the lab saw that

323
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,300
they brought the PNY
drives back to me

324
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,235
and they were like, hey
Cindy, look at this,

325
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,706
isn't this cool and I'm like,
that's very cool, right,

326
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:25,276
because from that standpoint
that same chip has been used

327
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,547
in a different application

328
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,217
but might that be an in for us

329
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,622
from a research point of view
into some of the mysteries

330
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:41,627
of that chip that gets
used in the iPhone 6, okay.

331
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,698
We haven't figured out
quite what we're gonna do

332
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:49,902
with that yet but it does
open up that new possibility.

333
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,404
Again, you find
yourself at the very top

334
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,273
of that Jenga tower going,

335
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,974
okay, what do I do now, right?

336
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,310
Like, what do I do with
this now that I see

337
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,379
that the possibilities
exist here?

338
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,916
So, hardware really does matter.

339
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,220
If I'm starting from
right to left here

340
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,621
you can see two phone boards.

341
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,559
One of them looks really
bad, right - really bad.

342
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,462
The other one is identical
but it hasn't been burned

343
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,363
with a body in a
burn barrel, okay.

344
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,066
So, Chicago Police
Department came to us.

345
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,502
They had a guy who
was killed and burned

346
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,037
in a barrel with his phone.

347
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,773
His phone was basically
a hockey puck.

348
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,511
We took the chip off
the burned board,

349
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,281
we put the chip back on
the not-burned board.

350
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,917
Hardware matters,
right, and we were able

351
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,151
to get the data out of that.

352
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,454
We also got the data
out of the MicroSD card.

353
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,725
In the middle there we
have a hardware solution

354
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,629
for getting data
out of an SD card.

355
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,599
In this case we're
using those taps

356
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,235
and soldering to them in
order to put them onto

357
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,404
an adapter and read directly
from the flash memory.

358
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:05,944
And on the far left,
what you're seeing

359
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:10,782
is our first attempts at
doing chip replacement

360
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,085
on a healthy smartphone.

361
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,055
So board to board
chip replacement in
order to get data out

362
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:20,993
of a locked phone, and
that was successful for us.

363
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,829
So, it's something that
we're starting to do more

364
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,767
is to say, hey, if we may
need to replace one chip

365
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,770
we may need to replace
two or three or four,

366
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,907
but sometimes the solution
to getting into these phones

367
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,743
isn't through the
software or the firmware

368
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,980
but in actually doing what
we call Franken-phones

369
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,985
and replacing the
hardware onto new phones.

370
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,124
So that work was done by
Mike Skaar on the end there,

371
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,360
and Greg Andrzejewski
and Mike worked

372
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,094
on the other two phones.

373
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:01,667
But some really cool and
new solutions to issues.

374
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:05,204
So, one of the
things I really loved

375
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,241
about Gillware when I first
walked into it is they have

376
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,912
this room they call
the hard drive library.

377
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,348
You're seeing a single row.

378
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,819
This is a room that has about
10 of these sets of shelves

379
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,388
with every make and
model of hard drive

380
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,889
right down to the old Bigfoot.

381
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,059
Do you remember those
old Bigfoot drive?

382
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,527
There's some brand
new leads in there,

383
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,663
there's some really old stuff
and there's some new stuff

384
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,667
and what they've done is
come up with this collection

385
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,770
of old hard drives, and at
first I didn't quite understand.

386
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,138
Like, what are you
doing with this?

387
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,406
You're hoarders, right.

388
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,274
I'm gonna come into
this hoarding company.

389
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,878
But I quickly came
to understand that,

390
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:50,682
hey, if you have a library
of drives at your disposal,

391
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,018
if you need to swap out
heads or swap a board

392
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,822
or do whatever then all you
gotta do is go to the library

393
00:20:56,822 --> 00:21:01,726
and checkout the right piece
of equipment to do that work.

394
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,297
So it becomes really,
really convenient.

395
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,601
So sometimes a simple
repair, a reconfiguration

396
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,106
can solve a problem that
other methods won't solve

397
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,945
and doing those board swaps
and chip swaps and head swaps

398
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,913
can get us into data
that we wouldn't be able

399
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:23,749
to get into before.

400
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,420
And then there are alternative
input methods, okay.

401
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,322
I'm showing you over
there on the left,

402
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,756
I know it's kind
of an ugly picture,

403
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,693
I snapped it with my iPhone
as we were doing this.

404
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,928
That is a broken iPad, you
can see the home button

405
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,833
is messed up and we were doing
a data recovery job here.

406
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,071
We were able to
bypass the passcode

407
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,608
not using the keyboard methods

408
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,977
that some people are using
to emulate a keyboard

409
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,581
but using some other
accessibility options, okay,

410
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:59,583
that I'm not going
to fully disclose

411
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,354
but needless to say it's
a hardware hack, right.

412
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,023
You can see that we're doing
something to that hardware

413
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,759
to bypass that and
we're using some

414
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,828
of those accessibility options.

415
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,798
So we couldn't do this
without having the hardware

416
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,701
and we couldn't do this
with the encrypted version

417
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,936
of the data on that chip.

418
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,272
We have to think about
these embedded systems

419
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,973
as a whole system.

420
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:26,978
So, yes, the data on the
drive or the chip matters.

421
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,115
Yes, the firmware matters
and yes, the hardware matters

422
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,285
and in combination all
three of those things,

423
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,654
if we're able to work
on that original device

424
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:40,659
or if we're able to come up
with a clone device of some sort

425
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,963
we can make some of
these issues work.

426
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:49,533
So this middle picture
looks weird, doesn't it?

427
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,737
Any guesses as to
what we've done there?

428
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,874
So, this is a phone.

429
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,810
The only problem with it
was that we couldn't get

430
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,713
it turned on, it had been
involved in a traffic accident.

431
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,048
We were trying to
get the data out

432
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,883
for a law enforcement agency.

433
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,887
They knew the passcode
but it wouldn't turn on.

434
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,855
It's an iPhone.

435
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,126
What you're seeing there
is just some freeze spray

436
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,928
so you can get this
kind of ice in a can,

437
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,832
and we've sprayed down the board

438
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,202
and then turned on the device

439
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,905
and you can see
the melted spots.

440
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,874
Those are the components
that are bad, okay.

441
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,175
Those are the ones
that are shorting out

442
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,643
and causing the problem.

443
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,814
Replace those components
that phone will work, okay.

444
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:40,018
So, what this caused me to
do, and every time I come

445
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,920
to a conference I have
the same problem, right.

446
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,389
You learn new stuff and
you're, like, I gotta go back

447
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,426
and work the last 10 cases
I worked because I missed.

448
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,831
And what this caused me to
do was to say to myself,

449
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,300
you know, those
hundreds of devices

450
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,168
that came through my
lab in law enforcement

451
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,070
where you plug it
in, you look at it,

452
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,773
you say, nothing here,
I'm gonna chuck that away

453
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,908
or this one doesn't work.

454
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,575
Okay, move onto the next one.

455
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,648
There's just so many things
that are possibilities

456
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,216
that I could go back and try.

457
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,187
But now I know they're
possibilities and
I can move forward.

458
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,788
What we need are
people who are thinking

459
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,791
about these possibilities
and moving it forward.

460
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,361
So, here's a great example.

461
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,131
This is actually the
example of someone breaking

462
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,732
my ground truth that got me

463
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,634
to leave law enforcement
a year early.

464
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,536
So, I left at 49.

465
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,372
I could have retired
with my pension at 50.

466
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,375
I wasn't gonna retire,
no danger of that.

467
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,446
But when I walked through
the lab they were working

468
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:45,817
on a data recovery case
for a photographer.

469
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,187
She had done a wedding
in a foreign country

470
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,223
and she had accidentally

471
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,359
after the wedding
reformatted her SD card.

472
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,761
It was for a celebrity
so she really needed

473
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,263
those pictures back.

474
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,532
They weren't gonna go back
and restage the wedding

475
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,701
and she had already
accepted her retainer

476
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:06,605
which was already
used in the travel,

477
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:10,242
so she was really
in a stuck position.

478
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:14,678
So, if you were to
look at this SD card

479
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,517
using forensics tools
this is what you'd see

480
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,186
in a hex editor,
all zeroes, okay.

481
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,822
You guys have been doing
forensics for a while,

482
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,591
when you see all zeroes
data's gone, right?

483
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,931
You're kinda screwed,
means it's wiped or,

484
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,334
you know, you're not gonna be
able to get data back from it.

485
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,703
Sorry about that, Viv,
I saw you laughin'.

486
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,971
It's 30 years of
law enforcement,

487
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,007
I'm gonna swear once
in a while (laughs).

488
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,312
So anyway, for the most
part in law enforcement

489
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,282
I would've been done
with this exam, right.

490
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,650
Another kinda picture's
case that coulda come in,

491
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,452
in a child pornography case.

492
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,621
I woulda looked at this SD card

493
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:59,124
and moved onto the
next piece of evidence.

494
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,594
I would have been
missing lots of data.

495
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:07,198
They were able to recover
300-plus images off this SD card

496
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,768
and I would have in law
enforcement left all

497
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,937
of those behind, okay.

498
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,607
We're not gonna be able
to do that with EnCase,

499
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,609
we're not gonna be able
to do that with FTK.

500
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:22,379
You have to have other
tools to get underneath

501
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,385
and in this case, in this
really super simplistic overview

502
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,554
about why you shouldn't
believe the card is empty,

503
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,296
our forensic software
understands things

504
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,966
at only the top level.

505
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,967
It can read that
file system data

506
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:47,205
and it can report it back to
you, but with flash memory

507
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,207
we also have the flash
translation layer

508
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,211
which shows through
the controller

509
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,815
how the device should
appear to the user.

510
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,484
If you reformat it, it
should appear to you

511
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,718
to be empty, correct?

512
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,356
And ready to be
read by other tools.

513
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,394
And underneath all that,

514
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:12,597
until garbage collection
and wear leveling happens,

515
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,965
all that data is there.

516
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,569
It's just the controller
has told the card

517
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,705
to report itself as empty, okay.

518
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:25,710
So, if we just ignore what
our friends at schools tell us

519
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,546
and get a physical
image of this card

520
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,549
usually through a
chip-off or a direct read

521
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:36,554
of that NAND memory
and then rebuild that,

522
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,392
we can start to see that
there's data still there.

523
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,428
And so, with flash
memory devices

524
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,233
there's usually two
avenues to data extraction

525
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,802
either through that
normal device interface

526
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,937
or through direct
read of the NAND.

527
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,073
If we're reading it through
the normal device interface,

528
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,677
whether we're talking
about an SD card

529
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,413
or a solid-state drive,

530
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,717
we have to power on
that device, right.

531
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,920
If we power on that
device what we're doing

532
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,289
is kicking in the
possibility of wear leveling

533
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,392
and garbage collection
happening and we could

534
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:17,262
be potentially destroying
things underneath

535
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,563
on the flash memory
itself, okay.

536
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,469
So, I'm not saying everybody,
stop what you're doing,

537
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,638
stop imaging those drives.

538
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:30,774
What I'm saying to you is
that this potential exists.

539
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:34,646
And so, in a case where
you have a thumb drive

540
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,584
and you need to know
what's in that flash memory

541
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,586
and you really,
really need to know

542
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,121
what used to be there too,

543
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,558
plugging it in is
probably a bad idea.

544
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,127
You should be chipping
that sucker off first

545
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,595
as your first response.

546
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,698
Luckily, thumb drives are
easy to put back together,

547
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,800
the soldering job is
not very hard at all.

548
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,505
But if you don't take that
opportunity and you plug it in

549
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:04,375
and electricity is
applied and wear leveling

550
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,378
and garbage collection
happen, then you're not going

551
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:11,349
to have the possibility
to get back anything

552
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,485
that might have been on there.

553
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,620
So, in this case
if we look below

554
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,257
that flash translation layer
at the physical memory itself,

555
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,927
we can see that data
is still there, okay.

556
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,164
I'm showing you a
picture of a screen

557
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,233
of a tool that's working.

558
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:31,970
This is resolute by
a Russian company

559
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,974
so it might preclude its use
by some people in the room

560
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,377
but it is a fantastic tool set.

561
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:44,382
So, when we read that chip
directly and read the NAND

562
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,752
we can see that there's
data still there.

563
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,289
This is a significant puzzle,
right, because every one

564
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,892
of those controllers for
every one of those chips

565
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,860
has its own recipe

566
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,697
for how to put it back together

567
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,935
and at that level when we're
looking at the substrate

568
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,138
of the chip itself and have
pulled back the data from it,

569
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,308
there are also errors in
the surface of the chip

570
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,677
and the controller
accounts for them, right.

571
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:15,813
So there are possibilities
that this can

572
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,249
be put back together
wrong or not quite right

573
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:21,019
or that it can
look exactly right

574
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,454
but be put together two
different ways, right,

575
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,058
because what we want is
that logical level above.

576
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,360
So, all I'm saying to you

577
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,697
is there are definitely
possibilities out there

578
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:37,202
that are beyond what we
know to be the ground truth.

579
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,972
I'm also saying to you that
at this point in time anyway,

580
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,908
it's not practical to
do this with every case

581
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,911
or with every device.

582
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,414
Individual NAND
flash memory chips

583
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:54,385
use industry
standard interfaces.

584
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:59,557
We can read that hardware,
we can pull it into our tools

585
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,694
and then work with it and it
seems really straight forward

586
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:07,699
but it's difficult to
make use of that raw data

587
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,702
and it's sometimes
difficult to figure out

588
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,571
what recipe has been
applied to that data

589
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,408
and to bring it back into a
way that makes sense to us.

590
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,277
A lot of this is proprietary
and we're waiting

591
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,480
on other people to reverse
engineer it, right,

592
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,916
or we've got people in
our labs who are working

593
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:29,187
on reverse engineering it,
but it's one of those things

594
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,688
where the technology
hasn't quite caught up

595
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,025
with our industry yet.

596
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,794
And, oh, by the way, this
can be physically destructive

597
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:40,965
to your original device which
people sometimes have a lot

598
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,533
of heartache with which
I totally get, right.

599
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,070
What do you mean you're gonna
destroy my original evidence

600
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,938
in order to get me
digital evidence.

601
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,742
That seems like a problem

602
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,512
and it can be depending
on the circumstances.

603
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,283
So, what do we do about it?

604
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,450
I don't think I'm here to
tell you all the answers.

605
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,422
I think part of the answer
is in being here, right.

606
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,693
As we learn more, as
Jake said in his talk,

607
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,030
we learn how much we don't
know and even when we know

608
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,433
how much we don't know
there is just a sea,

609
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,502
an ocean out there of things

610
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,805
that are beyond our own
knowledge so coming together

611
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,309
and sharing like this is
one way that we can start

612
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:29,113
to incorporate these issues
into our daily practice.

613
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,617
Some of this has to do
with patience, right.

614
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,553
It has to do with waiting
until the technology catches up

615
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,590
to where we're at and
finding the right individuals

616
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,695
to apply their brain to
these problems in order

617
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,432
to solve them and then share
it with others out there.

618
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,136
So, back to that first slide.

619
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,939
Do you remember the first
slide about drive imaging

620
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:59,143
and getting a first to last
bit image of the hard drive?

621
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,146
Up until 2012, when
I read the paper

622
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,115
that I cited in that slide.

623
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,053
I used to say, you know,
I imaged this hard drive

624
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,790
and I got a bit for bit
image of the entire drive

625
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,524
and that's what I
did my forensics on

626
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,363
and my police reports
read basically that way.

627
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:23,368
After 2012, I added the
words user addressable areas

628
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,571
(chuckles), right, and
then if it was a case

629
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,906
where it made sense
to I would explain

630
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:33,277
what I wasn't getting or
try to go after that data

631
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,413
and document in other ways.

632
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:38,449
And that's kind of the
approach we take, right.

633
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,385
If we learn something
new that sort

634
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:44,789
of changes the
paradigm in our field

635
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,694
there is this temptation
to go, I'm gonna wait,

636
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,096
I'm gonna cover up, I'm
gonna keep doing things

637
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:56,300
the way I've always done them,
I'm not gonna take any risks.

638
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,704
I'm gonna wait for the
world to sort it out, right,

639
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,073
and once somebody tells
me that they understand it

640
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:07,645
and they start teaching it
then I'll be good, right,

641
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:11,681
and I'll change what I'm doing
and it'll make more sense.

642
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:14,217
I'm here to tell you
we're all on the edge.

643
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:17,087
We are all on the edge of
understanding of this stuff

644
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,691
and it's because
technology moves faster

645
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:25,696
in its progression than any
one of us can keep up with

646
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:31,201
and so we are always on the
edge of discovery in this world.

647
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,840
So when you find it, share it,

648
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,543
and when you share it
make sure that it comes

649
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:41,512
with some good advice
about how to apply it

650
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,981
in the work you are
doing in the future.

651
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,784
And that's it.

652
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,786
My contact information
is up here.

653
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,987
Thank you.

654
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:53,424
(audience applause)

655
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,993
(upbeat music)
