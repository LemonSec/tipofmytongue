1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,569
(techno music)

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,276
(woosh)

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,277
(audience clapping)

4
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:15,615
- Okay so, as you heard,
my name's Lee Whitfield.

5
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,883
I work for SANS.

6
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,851
I work for the on-demand team.

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:24,189
So as much as I love and
endorse taking the live classes,

8
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,493
whenever you attend
events like this,

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,029
on-demand classes are awesome.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,930
You get four months
to take the class

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,433
and do all the exercises,
and everything else.

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,036
Wonderful. Highly recommend it.

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,105
And you know, even Rob
thinks it's a good idea too.

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,075
So go ahead and do that.

15
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,482
The last few times I
presented at this summit,

16
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,551
it's been a bit of
a mixed bag, okay.

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,320
Some of it is really technical.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,157
Some of it's not
really technical.

19
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,324
And this falls into like
that latter category.

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,428
So we're not gonna
go and dive into

21
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:05,899
really deep technical
details about things here.

22
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,302
But I think it's still
gonna be pretty valuable

23
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,237
to a lot of people.

24
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,841
Why would you do
evidence generation?

25
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:19,612
Well, a lot of the stuff
that we do on a daily basis

26
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,517
is based on some kind
of evidence generation.

27
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,252
So, like for example,

28
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:30,056
all of you saw Heather
and Sarah this morning

29
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:33,125
talking about the
ASF generation,

30
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,795
which they quite
amusingly generate,

31
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,398
pulling husbands through
fields and everything else.

32
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,268
They know what they did

33
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,704
so they're able to
correlate that data back.

34
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,673
They can tell you
when things happened

35
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,876
because they were
there at the time.

36
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,613
So the tools which they use
to do these kinds of things,

37
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,516
do these investigations,
and the procedures,

38
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,185
and everything else
they develop as a result

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,391
can be more effective
as a result.

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,828
Because they were there.

41
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,295
Same goals whenever
you want to generate

42
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,965
any kind of test evidence.

43
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:17,537
So some of you may think
well, yeah you know what,

44
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,839
it's not that big of a deal.

45
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,375
I'll let other
people handle that.

46
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,211
But what I can tell
you is that some point,

47
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,646
throughout your career,

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,482
you're gonna encounter
that one forensic artifact.

49
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:34,487
Some random Chinese social
media application, you know,

50
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,123
or something else you
have to then pass out,

51
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,191
get the data from,
and figure it out.

52
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,027
Now that can be really difficult

53
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,095
if you're just taking
things straight off

54
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,531
a piece of evidence

55
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,401
because you have no
background in that whatsoever.

56
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,604
You have some indication
though what it's doing.

57
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,607
Unless you get down
into the meat yourself,

58
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,043
generate the test
evidence yourself,

59
00:02:57,043 --> 00:03:00,046
with all the notes
and everything that
go along with it,

60
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:04,951
you may not get as good of
results as you're hoping for.

61
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
And you can guess

62
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,522
which always goes really
well in this field, um no.

63
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,293
Testing your evidence,

64
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,094
generating test evidence,

65
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,029
when you test your
forensic tools

66
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,463
is always gonna be a good idea.

67
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:23,002
So, as before, why would
you do test evidence?

68
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,673
Well you can validate
your existing tools.

69
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,908
You can then move
into tool development

70
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,411
if you find something
which is a bit more niche.

71
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,681
You can use it for
testing new hires.

72
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,550
You can then use it also
for testing current staff,

73
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,519
making sure that
they own things.

74
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,322
And then you add in the
educational components too.

75
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:50,129
So let's take a look first
here and kinda tie it together.

76
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,932
And there's various
different reasons

77
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,636
you might want to do this
for existing tool validation.

78
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:01,541
Now the first one is that
if any of you have ever done

79
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,143
any kind of lab
accreditation or ISO work,

80
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,578
anyone here done that before?

81
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,250
No. I don't see any hands.

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,618
You're all very lucky then.

83
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:16,221
I did ISO 17025
documentation for a company

84
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,823
I used to work for
back in the UK.

85
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,892
And it's a nightmare.

86
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,830
Any time you get
a new tool release

87
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,399
you have to use
your golden image

88
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,202
to then verify
everything that happens.

89
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,606
Make sure that all the data
outputs for the forensic tool

90
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,108
that are accurate.

91
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,576
And they're inaccurate
you have to go back

92
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:39,846
and right up a cause for
whatever report your generating.

93
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,983
Now obviously lab
accreditation, ISO work,

94
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,820
is not the only time when you
want to validate your tools.

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,724
If anyone remembers the social
experiment by Harlan Carvey.

96
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,062
Yeah I see people
nodding their heads.

97
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,667
That's one very very good
reason why you want to validate

98
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,633
your source.

99
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,205
It also depends a lot on
how you want to do this

100
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,308
or what you want to do.

101
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,043
Like are you looking at,

102
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,178
do you want to test a
full forensic image,

103
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,448
do you want to test a
sub-set of that data?

104
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:20,453
For example if you want to
analyzed like registry keys

105
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,822
or specific registry key,

106
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,925
you don't want or need a
full forensic image right?

107
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,461
You just focus on
something smaller.

108
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,729
And generally that
kind of evidence

109
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,664
is really straight
forward and easy.

110
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,400
All you do is type
some stuff in,

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,135
maybe browse a few websites,

112
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,837
do some activity on the computer

113
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,306
and boom you've
got your registry.

114
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,610
There may be other things too,

115
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,914
very specific artifacts
that you want to focus on.

116
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,317
In that case to generate
those specific artifacts only

117
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,485
you feed them into whatever tool

118
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,687
or to whatever
analysis you need to

119
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:59,225
and then you can validate
your tool that way.

120
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,962
The next thing is the
testing of new hires.

121
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,865
Potentially your
existing staff too.

122
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,870
I've had a couple job
interviews in the last few years

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,474
where I was actually given
forensic evidence to test.

124
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:20,480
And I had to analyze that
data, produce a report,

125
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:26,953
and then my capacity
as a future employee

126
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,489
was evaluated based
upon what I found.

127
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,191
Now there's a few
different reasons for this.

128
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,196
Now yes you want someone
to be able to use the tools

129
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,664
which you are going
to use every day

130
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:42,101
but that's not really the most
important reason for this.

131
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,303
The most important reason is
that you wanna have someone

132
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:49,308
who will critically look
at the ways to do things.

133
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,879
Who have developed knowledge
and procedures themselves

134
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,849
that will help them to get
to the underlying evidence.

135
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,819
Yes it's great to able to
sit there and push buttons

136
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,554
on the piece of software

137
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,789
and for everything to
be going practically

138
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,795
but you don't need to
hire people like that.

139
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,999
You can have the
cleaner come in at night

140
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,902
when you're at home
it's really easy.

141
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,570
You want someone who
will critically think

142
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,871
through the whole process.

143
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,675
And then finally,

144
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,645
we have the
educational component.

145
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,316
How many of you people here
today are gonna stick around

146
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,019
after this one is over

147
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,855
and take one of the
forensics classes on offer?

148
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,359
Okay. There 900
of you by the way.

149
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:41,327
That's not enough.

150
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,233
If you choose to take
one of these classes

151
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,335
almost every single one
of the forensic classes

152
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,637
on offer here will
walk you through

153
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:56,642
specific evidence scenarios
that the authors and instructors

154
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,045
have created for themselves.

155
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,950
Further, you'll get to
the day six challenge

156
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,485
and the instructors, again,

157
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,421
have created those
scenarios for you.

158
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,857
And we heard Heather and
Sarah again saying today

159
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,659
that they have brand new
scenarios that they've created.

160
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,131
The amount of work that goes
into these is phenomenal.

161
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:25,104
I know talking to Sarah
that she has been basically

162
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:30,109
traversing the globe with a
backpack full of MAC systems

163
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,611
in order to generate
all of this data.

164
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,648
It takes a long time
and we'll get into that

165
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,849
in just a minute.

166
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,786
But basically for these
all you wanna know is

167
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,420
whether or not people
actually find out

168
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,123
what you want them to find.

169
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,095
Oh, also, just quickly.

170
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,696
Let's not forget NetWars too.

171
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,599
If you've just been in
the FIR NetWars this week,

172
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,572
again evidence data
which has been generated

173
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,675
by the instructors for you
to participate in that.

174
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,843
So all these things go towards

175
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,814
this is why evidence
generation is important.

176
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,252
So about a year ago

177
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,356
Rob asked me to
help him to generate

178
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,859
a new forensics challenge
for Forensics 500.

179
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,030
And we've called it
the Stack Challenge

180
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,899
because it's the name
of the person involved.

181
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,668
This one is pretty interesting.

182
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,371
I'd never done anything
like this before

183
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,473
and Rob gave me some
guidelines and instruction

184
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,375
on how to make this work.

185
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,546
And it was pretty
fun and interesting

186
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,715
and I learned a lot of
stuff along the way.

187
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,755
I had to come up with my own
set of guidelines though.

188
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,092
So first obviously
you need a plan.

189
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,428
You can't just kind of think,

190
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,563
well we'll do a bit of
this, a bit of that,

191
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,098
and maybe at the end of the
day we'll have something

192
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,901
which students in Forensic
500 will enjoy doing.

193
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,437
Nyeh, it doesn't work that way.

194
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,274
So I had to come
up with this plan.

195
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,977
I sat down with
my family actually

196
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,112
and came up with this scenario.

197
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,149
And if you're taking
forensics 500 this week

198
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,250
and you're sitting
there taking notes

199
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,685
really quickly and like,

200
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:20,953
yes this is gonna help
me on the challenge,

201
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,188
no it's not gonna help
you on the challenge.

202
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,557
This is all from a very
high level I'm sorry,

203
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,524
take notes anyway.

204
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,396
We sat down together,
made this plan.

205
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,968
We tried to figure out what
exactly we were gonna need.

206
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:41,540
Then we evaluated that plan
and we tried to find out

207
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,943
where the good and bad
spots were and all that.

208
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,078
We implemented it
and then we conducted

209
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,079
what I call the post-mortem.

210
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,415
And that might look bad,

211
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:53,386
it's just my own way of
saying post evaluation.

212
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,854
The planning phase.

213
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,726
The first thing we
needed to do as Rob said,

214
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,529
we wanna get all
of these artifacts

215
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,165
and as much as covered
in the material

216
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,000
we need to try and generate.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,435
And that can be pretty difficult

218
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,303
and we get into why
in just a minute.

219
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,841
But what we needed to
do in order to generate

220
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,745
all these artifacts in the
appropriate amount of time

221
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,847
was that I wrote a script.

222
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,216
Now I'm not talking
about a Python script.

223
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,552
I'm talking actually
about a physical,

224
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,555
here's a bound
movie or TV script,

225
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,691
where we outlined this
is what was gonna happen

226
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,026
on this particular date.

227
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,527
This is why it was gonna happen

228
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,431
and this where it lines up
with the whole storyline

229
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,533
and so on and so forth.

230
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,203
And we all agreed we were
gonna stick as rigidly

231
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,603
to that script as possible.

232
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,742
And then once we had
that plan in place

233
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,378
we could then go
back and say well,

234
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,682
we can determine what we
need in terms of hardware.

235
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,052
That one got to be a
little bit interesting

236
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,288
and I'll get on to that
again in just a minute.

237
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,791
But one of the main things
that I was going for with this

238
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,128
was realism okay.

239
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:14,433
The last thing we want
is for people to open up

240
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,336
a forensic image and
for it to be like,

241
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,138
what the crap is this.

242
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,807
This doesn't look real at all.

243
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,276
And I've got a couple
of examples here.

244
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:27,713
The first one is that
when I was at University

245
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,247
I actually did digital forens...

246
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,917
I was one of the first digital
forensics students in the UK.

247
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:38,491
Our lecturer for one of our
group projects provided us

248
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,328
with a forensic image
and basically said

249
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,964
go and analyze this,
produce a report,

250
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,999
and you'll get graded
on your report.

251
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:52,938
Now from what I could tell,

252
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,509
he generated this over the
space of like a week and a half.

253
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,911
On a VM, on a system somewhere,

254
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,380
and it was this really
contrived scenario

255
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,649
where fishing and
anything to do with fish

256
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,351
was completely illegal.

257
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,653
So we had to look up
anything to do with fishing

258
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,121
and produce a report on it.

259
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:16,362
I find it really hard to
suspend my belief in reality

260
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,432
and so I didn't go along with
what the assignment was at all

261
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:25,437
instead I went about proving
that he set this person up

262
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,308
with all this fake evidence
because of him installing

263
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,410
VM-ware tools, it being a VM.

264
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,712
Lots of other nice
stuff in the registry

265
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,146
and everything else.

266
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:39,718
And my final report said
something along the lines of,

267
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,421
this is all fake, this is
a whole bunch of nonsense.

268
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,026
The lecturer very begrudgingly

269
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,027
gave me a very
high mark for that.

270
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,263
So yeah.

271
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,399
We wanna try and keep
things realistic.

272
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,870
Another instance that I
recently became aware of,

273
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,938
and I'm sorry Rob,

274
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:03,776
was that for the old
scenario in Forensics 500

275
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,279
apparently there
was a team recently

276
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,415
that they dove so
far into the data

277
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,786
that rather than doing
the outlined challenge,

278
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,722
they basically presented
at the end of the class

279
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:21,727
why Rob Lee had set up
this whole murder-suicide.

280
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,534
The idea is we don't
want that to happen.

281
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,869
We want students to come in,

282
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,439
to do these challenges
and for it to be,

283
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,209
this could actually be
someone's real computer.

284
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,478
This is something we
want to investigate

285
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,613
and get our teeth into.

286
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,149
So that was the plan.

287
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,753
Then we went back and
reevaluated the plan.

288
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,154
And we made a few changes,

289
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:53,926
because some of it,
while realistic,

290
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,064
was still bordered on
the lines of realism.

291
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,935
There was a few things we
wanted to look at first.

292
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,205
Can we do what we want
to do? Is it possible?

293
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,510
Whenever we put this plan
together in this script

294
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,779
we try to identify certain areas

295
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,781
where it was gonna be difficult.

296
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,382
And we'll get onto
one of those reasons

297
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,984
why it's difficult very soon.

298
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,590
We want it to be realistic.

299
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,759
We want people to actually
see this computer image

300
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,127
and be like wow this
could actually be

301
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,029
a real piece of
evidence in the case.

302
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,466
And then, what could go wrong?

303
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,303
And my first thought
was, nothing.

304
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,604
Nothing could go wrong.

305
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,774
And I was wrong okay.

306
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,677
If you think that nothing
will go wrong, you are wrong.

307
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,417
We moved on to the
implementation stage

308
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,820
and this is where things
really started to go weird.

309
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,322
I don't know if any
of you are familiar

310
00:15:56,322 --> 00:16:00,659
with that particular saying,
man plans and God laughs.

311
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,830
Yeah I got a sense of
that as I was doing this.

312
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,434
So the first thing was,

313
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,371
this challenge revolves
around a single computer.

314
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,074
And so I thought, yes,
this is gonna be easy.

315
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:19,178
A single computer this
is all I'm gonna need.

316
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,681
Hmm. Well.

317
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,586
I was carrying around
the equivalent of a
small data center.

318
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,757
So we've moved on
from one surface

319
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,060
to a surface and a surface
book and a MacBook Pro.

320
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,363
Two iPhones, two wifi hotspots.

321
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,133
A nook, an android
device, an iPad.

322
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,236
Yeah all these things came
in and there was a few more

323
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,572
but they might give some
things away in the challenge

324
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,073
so I'm not gonna go into them.

325
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,476
This is what was...

326
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,878
This was the hardware
that we needed.

327
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:55,014
And then aside from
just the hardware

328
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,949
we also had other
things we needed.

329
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,218
So because of the
nature of this scenario

330
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,055
we needed to be able to
use the local high school

331
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,258
and their wifi network.

332
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:10,229
Now apparently the
school's don't much like

333
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,532
when 40 year old men hang
around outside high schools

334
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,001
(audience laughs)

335
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:19,771
with cellphones and computers.

336
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,206
At least that's what the police
said when they showed up.

337
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,379
We needed to kind of re-think
that strategy a little bit.

338
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:29,947
And we'll get on to
that in just a moment.

339
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,352
We wanted to use the
high school's network.

340
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,021
Another thing is that
we needed somewhere

341
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,758
for this person to live and
that's actually my house.

342
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,993
And if you take the challenge

343
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,629
you will have my own
physical address,

344
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,665
feel free to stop by
for a brief visit.

345
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:53,739
And then one of my friends,
and yes I do have friends,

346
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,109
also kindly offered for
us to use his house too

347
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,845
as a second part
of the scenario.

348
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,149
Don't go visit him, he has
a big dog and guns okay.

349
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,883
So don't go knocking
on his door,

350
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,120
hey I know where you live
because I saw in the show.

351
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,088
No don't do that.

352
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:14,993
Then we also set up
Microsoft online exchange.

353
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,495
And where we were going
to mimic the school.

354
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,065
So this was interesting.

355
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,302
In order to make things
realistic and believable.

356
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,669
Every single email

357
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,206
that I received from the
high school last year

358
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,776
I basically copy and pasted,

359
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,714
put it into a new email with a
different person's name on it

360
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:39,051
a made up person,
and then sent it.

361
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,489
You'll see if you
do this challenge

362
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,358
there's kind of a lot of this
realistic stuff going on.

363
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,863
We also needed an office because
if you go into high school

364
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,265
you get homework and you
need to do assignments.

365
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,138
And then another
interesting piece,

366
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,042
is it realistic if
you examine a computer

367
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,512
and there's no purchases made?

368
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,647
Hmm maybe.

369
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,684
But you're gonna expect to
see things like Netflix,

370
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,655
or Hulu, or Spotify or
something like that.

371
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,024
Even games right?

372
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,958
And it's not realistic if
those things aren't found

373
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,661
on that computer.

374
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,797
So we used pre-paid credit cards

375
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:30,802
and we go out and we'd purchase
these with subject's name,

376
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,504
I'm not sure the entirely
legality of that,

377
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,873
but we'll leave that alone.

378
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:40,779
And so we did like
Netflix accounts

379
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,482
and we did other things,
we bought other things,

380
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,751
using these pre-paid credit
cards to make it look like

381
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,186
this was actually realistic.

382
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:53,992
And then finally again because
of the high school issue

383
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,230
I couldn't go and
do that myself.

384
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,166
So I decided I needed
a teenage girl to help.

385
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,604
Apparently the police didn't
like this idea either.

386
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,507
But thankfully I already
had one at my disposal.

387
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,110
My 14-year-old daughter
Kaylee was starting

388
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,045
her freshman year at high
school at the same time

389
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,847
so very very convenient.

390
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:20,852
And there were some things
I had to give up for this.

391
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,257
I had to empty my
wallet first of all.

392
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,393
And second of all I promised
her she could accompany me

393
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,264
as my guest here and so
she's here today watching.

394
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,533
And this whole--

395
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,767
(clapping)

396
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:43,875
And so what's really
cool about this is that

397
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,144
this Microsoft surface
which is the subject

398
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,846
of the investigation
in this case

399
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,850
Kaylee she walked around
with that in her high school

400
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,353
backpack for like half
of the school year.

401
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,322
She was connected
to the school wifi.

402
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:02,226
She was surfing web pages,
using it for artwork.

403
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,630
The only thing
that she didn't do

404
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,164
with kind of ticked
me off a little bit

405
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,433
is that she didn't do the
homework for this person.

406
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,936
So I had to do all
the homework myself.

407
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,506
Don't know why I was
paying her for to be fair.

408
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:21,580
Another issue that we
had is that early on

409
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,049
this was not the
Stack Challenge.

410
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,952
Those of you who take
SANS classes will know

411
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,088
that there's a running
theme through many of these

412
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,923
and that's the Marvel
universe right.

413
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,130
Originally I thought well
no-one's touched Spider-Man yet.

414
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,331
This will be cool.

415
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,199
We'll have Peter Parker,
and we'll have Gwen,

416
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,570
and we'll have MJ, and
we'll do all these people.

417
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,540
So I set up all these Facebook
accounts for those people.

418
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,376
Then I went onto my
own Facebook account

419
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,911
and said to all my friends,

420
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,846
hey go follow these Facebook
accounts that I've created

421
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,083
so that I can develop
evidence for my scenario.

422
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,953
Yeah well that didn't work
exactly as planned either.

423
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:05,791
So Facebook around this
time because of the whole

424
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,796
election rigging decided
that they were gonna be

425
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,433
cracking down on fake
Facebook accounts.

426
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,535
And so I went to log in
after a couple of months

427
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:21,039
of generating data just
to find it had all gone.

428
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,541
So yeah.

429
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:26,144
Reevaluated and thought yeah
alright let's change this

430
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,746
because you know if you're using

431
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,482
comic book character's
names on social media

432
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,517
Facebook are probably gonna
find them pretty quickly.

433
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,919
Especially if I
go in and announce

434
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,954
the fact that they're
fake accounts too.

435
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:37,055
Probably didn't help.

436
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,928
We finally got the
whole thing done.

437
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,033
This took about six months
in total to do all this.

438
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,068
Once again realism.

439
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,270
You don't want to just
have a period of two weeks

440
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,639
where data is
generated on a computer

441
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,174
if you want it to be realistic.

442
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,642
It just doesn't work that way.

443
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:03,081
We got to the end. I
imaged the computer.

444
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:06,650
And then started to look at
what we did and didn't have.

445
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:12,491
When we compared the
plan to the results

446
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:16,895
there were some things which
I'd thought we'd generated

447
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,197
which weren't properly captured.

448
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,333
Now whether that's because
of the type of computer

449
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,769
we were using,

450
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,305
whether it's due to
Windows updates happening,

451
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:29,307
or something else
I just don't know.

452
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:33,011
Or delay right,
something made it

453
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,414
so that some of these
things just didn't appear.

454
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,918
We can get on to what
went wrong in a second.

455
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,689
After we decided what went wrong

456
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,526
and what we needed to change

457
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,362
hopefully Rob will ask
me to do this again.

458
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,900
What do we do, what happened?

459
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,737
Well, time is a huge factor.

460
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,641
I have a full time
job with SANS.

461
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,744
I also run my own consultancy
company on the side.

462
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,179
And then I also have my family

463
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,882
and other obligations
I got to deal with.

464
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,020
I would have alarms go
off on my phone saying,

465
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,521
send this text message now,

466
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,624
or do this, send this email.

467
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,394
And you know, if you're
driving in the car somewhere,

468
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,597
and that alarm goes
off it's like oh crap.

469
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,866
We'll put that down and
we'll deal with that later.

470
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:32,871
So a lot of time the times
were a little bit dicey.

471
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:37,274
Then there was the,

472
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,614
what we shouldn't have
really done at all

473
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,485
part of this and that is,

474
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,520
you kind of got
this plan in place,

475
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,855
you're following this plan,

476
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,859
and then suddenly Rob was like,

477
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,393
"Oh have you thought
about doing this?"

478
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,196
I'm lik, oh, ah, no.

479
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,068
Ah I guess we'll figure
out a way to put that in.

480
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:07,706
Yeah, mmm. That wasn't
really the best idea either.

481
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,078
There were times when evidence
was kinda force-created.

482
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,415
We had to change a setting
which someone wouldn't

483
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:20,185
typically change
inside a Windows system

484
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:23,088
in order to force
evidence to be generated.

485
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,423
So some of that you
have to kinda suspend

486
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,094
your belief in reality
just a little bit.

487
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,565
This was the major thing for me.

488
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,170
Like I said before,

489
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,909
my home address appears
in that whole scenario,

490
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,810
but there were a few
other things too.

491
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:50,282
And I've since learned this.

492
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,487
Part of the issue here is,

493
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,358
it's just the way the
scenario was set up.

494
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:04,963
We had this test computer
on my home network

495
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:08,366
connecting to wifi
and whatever else.

496
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,937
It could also see other
items on my home network.

497
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,671
Then when I went to
my friend's house

498
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:15,473
same thing happened
over there too.

499
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,778
It's not major data leakage.

500
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:22,948
You won't find
inappropriate pictures of me

501
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,016
or anything like that on there.

502
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,621
But there are some things
in there you might think,

503
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,990
huh I wonder if he meant
that to be in there.

504
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,692
No, not really.

505
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,860
So how do we protect
against some of this?

506
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,165
When we went back and
looked at and conducted

507
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,469
this post-mortem the
major thing was network.

508
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,304
You could see things happening.

509
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,208
Because of the
way it was set up,

510
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,178
my home wifi ends up
getting in there too.

511
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,579
So you will see that.

512
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,822
I went and spoke to Phil
Hagen about this a little bit.

513
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,457
And I asked for his
recommendations on things

514
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,993
and after sitting in his class

515
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,395
and him showing how his
home network was set up,

516
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,367
I've gone out now and I've
invested a good chunk of money

517
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,703
in updating my home network.

518
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,239
So now rather than
having everything

519
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,241
on one particular network,

520
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,510
I can say right I'm
creating a VLAN.

521
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,480
And that VLAN will be
specifically for testing

522
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,849
and evidence generation,
all that kind of thing.

523
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,119
Which is wonderful that I
can create a wifi network

524
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,353
which is specific to that VLAN.

525
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:41,259
That should separate
all of that stuff out.

526
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,494
And it's a great idea.

527
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,862
And if you're
serious about testing

528
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,498
you're gonna need a
set up similar to that.

529
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,067
You can't just run it
off whatever you want

530
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,303
because I guarantee something
you don't want to be

531
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,305
on that image will
end up on that image.

532
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,745
And then we have my Xbox. And
this thing really annoyed me.

533
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,953
Rob suggested we use one of
those pre-paid credit cards

534
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:13,091
and we download a couple
of games onto this surface.

535
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,428
This surface has
okay graphics support

536
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,597
but it's not like a
gaming system okay.

537
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,334
So we bought a couple of
games on the Windows store

538
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,137
and I let my kids play on
these games for a little bit

539
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,273
but they got kinda frustrated
with it immediately

540
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:29,841
because the graphics
weren't good enough,

541
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,877
and game lag, it was slow.

542
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,611
So I thought, this
is a good idea,

543
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:39,617
I'll put this girl's
account on my Xbox

544
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,554
and then they can play
the games on there

545
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,256
'cause like Apple have those
cross-platform games now.

546
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:51,129
And when I was reviewing the
forensic image of this computer

547
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,331
ahh maybe that wasn't
such a good idea.

548
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,401
At least not on my
own personal Xbox

549
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,404
because now whenever
you look on there

550
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:04,342
yes you'll see my login
information for Xbox Live.

551
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,244
Feel free to friend me.

552
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,249
We can play games together.

553
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,520
But yeah, was not
my intention at all.

554
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,425
All these things
contributed to...

555
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,562
personally I think this is a
really good piece of evidence,

556
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,532
there's lots of
good stuff in there.

557
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,968
There's only a ti...

558
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,469
I talk about this
like it's a big deal,

559
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,005
it's not, this is a tiny tiny
piece of the overall thing.

560
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:36,074
It's still a good
great scenario.

561
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,511
And because of the way which
we dealt with everything,

562
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,814
Kaylee walking around with
a laptop for six months,

563
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:46,518
me generating school
emails and everything else.

564
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,156
To make this realistic

565
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:54,158
we generated a lot of
background noise for this.

566
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,995
Whenever Rob handed
out this challenge

567
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,900
on the first run of this
people actually thought

568
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,602
this was a real piece
of evidence at times.

569
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,938
Just because of the
quantity of data on there.

570
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:12,410
I think we actually we made it.

571
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,579
Some of it it seemed like
it was a bit difficult

572
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,015
for us to do but we finally
made it over the finish line.

573
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:25,523
Now like I said, I don't
know how many people here,

574
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,493
are gonna go out and
produce full pieces

575
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,862
of forensic evidence
a full image of a disc

576
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,799
for testing or whatever else.

577
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,204
And this may be kind of
like a unique circumstance,

578
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:44,242
but I know there's people here
who teach University classes

579
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,478
who teach SANS classes, who
teach classes in other formats.

580
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:54,018
This has been a very
valuable experience.

581
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,891
Please don't make the
same mistakes I did.

582
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,161
Whenever you plan,
stick to that plan.

583
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,930
But make sure that
plan is viable.

584
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,000
Don't make things
up that are gonna be

585
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,269
completely unrealistic.

586
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,504
Don't have your person
traveling to another country

587
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,840
if you're not prepared to
travel to another country.

588
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,910
If you start going back and
messing around with data

589
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,948
after you've already
generated it people will know.

590
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,918
People who take these
classes are not stupid okay.

591
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,053
They're smart people who
probably work in this field

592
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,288
for a long time.

593
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,024
If you start going in
and changing things

594
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,226
you will leave
footprints every where.

595
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:39,530
You know, USB history,
log files, time stamps.

596
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,833
Whatever it is you change,

597
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,802
people will find out and it
will detract from that realism.

598
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,907
So that's my plea to you.

599
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,141
If you're gonna
generate evidence

600
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:55,179
make sure you generate the
appropriate amount of evidence

601
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,015
whatever it is
that you wanna do.

602
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:01,653
If you choose to go down the
whole, complete image route,

603
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,455
be prepared to
invest a lot of time,

604
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,890
a lot of money and
a lot of thought

605
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,560
into how you're going
to accomplish it.

606
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,629
When you do that, guarantee,
you'll be a lot better off.

607
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,234
And you're test evidence will
look absolutely spectacular.

608
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,402
So that's all I've got.

609
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,839
(applause)
