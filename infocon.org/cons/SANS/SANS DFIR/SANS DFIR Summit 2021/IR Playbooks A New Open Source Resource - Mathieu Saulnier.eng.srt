67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
the subject of today so um

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,560
first of all i'm going to talk about the

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
background and how this whole project

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
came to be

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
uh i'm going to present the current

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,360
offering in open source playbooks and

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,280
i'm going to talk about our

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
our hybrid format

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
uh and i will present the current

76
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,400
playbook that we have open source and

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
then how you can actually contribute to

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
this project

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,680
um these full screen picture are there

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
only so i can drink a sip of water

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,840
without you no no uh

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
noticing

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,319
and a disclaimer of course this is my

84
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
own opinions and not those of my

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
employer and these are not our actual

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,319
playbooks they are kind of rendition

87
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,760
and there's a few things that we have to

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,159
remove of course

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,120
um so the background about a year ago in

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
in early june july and syntax was

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
looking for a

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,879
senior manager incident response and

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
they wanted someone to own their

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,280
incident response program

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,680
after a few

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
interviews i was hired as a

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
i was hired in july to 2020 and one of

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
the things that i said many times during

99
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
those interviews is that if this format

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
is interesting i would really love to

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
share it with the community

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
um and they agreed to that so here i am

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
a year later presenting to sam's differ

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
summit which i believe is one of the

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,319
best place to actually uh release that

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,360
work

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
um

108
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
one of the first thing i started doing

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
when i got

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
hired is ask a question

111
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,160
to the stock analysts to the management

112
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
and to also the higher management as to

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,960
exactly what they wanted

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
um so when i talked with the

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
suck analysts what they wanted was

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,479
something that i would call micro place

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,800
or work instruction so really a

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,360
procedure a step-by-step things that

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
they need to do to actually perform um

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
the incident response

121
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
when i talk to the

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,840
uh management

123
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,440
of the sock they say that they want it

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
more like a process so the big steps

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,919
that they should make sure that their

126
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,280
team follows

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
uh in order to go through the incident

128
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
response

129
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,479
and finally when i talked to the higher

130
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,320
management what they really wanted was a

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
crisis management plan so they wanted

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
more a plan they wanted to know uh who

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,759
they need to contact outside which team

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
uh internally they needed also to engage

135
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
in case of a major crisis so three level

136
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,160
and three very different type of

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
needs

138
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,680
so i represented this a little bit like

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
this so yeah the incident response plan

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
that is at the top here and it's more uh

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
using sea level or higher management

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
then you have the middle layer uh for

143
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
stock manager or maybe for more senior

144
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,360
analysts which is the the the playbooks

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,479
themselves

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,320
uh and here you have something like

147
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
ransom playbook active directory

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
compromise uh the good old fishing

149
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
playbook and uh of course account

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,199
compromise and a few others

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,080
um

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
so these are the ones that we're gonna

153
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,560
share today so this middle layer here

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
and then for the stock analyst um as i

155
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,639
said they wanted something that they

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
could give to maybe a new hire and they

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,880
would be ready to go and so here you

158
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
would have things like how to submit a

159
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,400
hash to virustotal hybrid analysis how

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,720
can you retrieve a pcap from different

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
type of waff or ips that you may manage

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
how to create user in your various

163
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
security solution you know all of those

164
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
things that are kind of step by step and

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,120
that might or not happen on every single

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
instant response and once you know how

167
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,880
to do them you don't actually need to

168
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
have them every time in your

169
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
playbooks or in your you don't need to

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
see them and you'll see how we addressed

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,880
that

172
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,600
so let's go over the current offering of

173
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
open source playbook

174
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,759
i think the one that is the most famous

175
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
is the irm from society general which is

176
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,319
a french

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,039
bank or french financial institution it

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,080
is in pdf it is extremely windows

179
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,199
centrics

180
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
um it is more like a procedure so at the

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
the work instruction level if you want

182
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
to continue the

183
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,120
to keep the same uh wording

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
and it didn't have any idiots in five

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,599
years and

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,800
fun fact is even if the

187
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
societal is a french financial

188
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
institution they don't have any french

189
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
playbooks but they have russians

190
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
playbook so what do you think of that

191
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,680
um another one that is uh often

192
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,759
referenced is the

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
scottish government

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
playbooks

195
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,599
you can find at gov.gov it is also in

196
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,240
pdf although this one was reviewed in

197
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,240
2020 there is a lot of overlap between

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,599
the different playbook if you look at

199
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,680
the ransomware playbook and the malware

200
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
playbook there is a lot of things that

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,759
are exactly the same that's also

202
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
something that we tried to avoid when we

203
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
built our own playbooks uh one thing

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,639
that i like about these ones is that in

205
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,919
the nx you have a workflow uh but it's

206
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
more like a timeline it's it's kind of

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
flow it's it's a

208
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
more like a continuous line

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,080
as opposed to this one from incident

210
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
response where you kind of have some

211
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
some flow and some direction uh this one

212
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,560
is called from the consortium they have

213
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
pdf and visio so you can modify them

214
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
they have a total of nine playbooks but

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
in my opinion they are all very similar

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,560
and they use this type of flowcharts

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,039
next one is iu.com a little bit less

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
known i believe they're not part of

219
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,440
resolve not exactly sure what that is

220
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
they are images they are very limited

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,640
simple they are extremely eye level but

222
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,320
they are interesting flow charts and as

223
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
you can see there's some decision some

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,760
questions that you must ask yes no and

225
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,919
then redirect you to different places

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,000
and finally one that i found i believe

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
on the sans

228
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,959
website when i was looking it's from uh

229
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
taxati um in the presentation that was

230
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,640
done by a guy named chris taylor it is a

231
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,800
mix of powerpoint

232
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,839
visa

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
and visio order io it is they are

234
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,000
workflows um but what i really really

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
like about this one is that every

236
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
box in the workflow as a description

237
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,519
with bullet points as to exactly what is

238
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,320
supposed to be performed in those box

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,120
for me it was the perfect level of high

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,160
level

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,959
and

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,200
explanation

243
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,399
so i really really

244
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,880
felt in love with that format

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,959
there was really one problem

246
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,600
is that there was only one and of course

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,440
like most presentation

248
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
it was the fishing one

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
so always

250
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
i don't know why when everybody present

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,480
their their playbooks they're always

252
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,399
presenting the fishing playbooks so i

253
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,279
made 100 sure that today i will not be

254
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
presenting a fishing playbook

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,279
that brings me to our phone playbooks

256
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,240
which is kind of a

257
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,760
an hybrid i would say uh it is hosted in

258
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,720
git it is in markdown and we use draw i

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
o for our workflow it is open

260
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
it is free and it's very easy to modify

261
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
um

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
so if you're familiar with git markdown

263
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
or if you're not it's uh it's a language

264
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,480
it's just text based and you can easily

265
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,079
edit a file in a simple text editor same

266
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
thing for draw i o it's kind of a free

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,680
online version

268
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
of visual so you can open the file and

269
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,360
you can modify them at your art content

270
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
after i started my format i started

271
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,720
talking on some different uh platform

272
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
and uh i came in contact with the react

273
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
project

274
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
which is part of the atc project uh what

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
i like about this this type this this

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,399
um

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,000
framework or this repository this

278
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
project that's the words i was looking

279
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,399
for it has it is very

280
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
modular so they have module for

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,440
everything it's like lego blocks and you

282
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
pick the lego blocks that you want in

283
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,079
order to build your playbook

284
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,320
and it is open source

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
but right now it is more of a framework

286
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,279
place over so all of the little blocks

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,320
they look a little bit like the

288
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,800
screenshot here so you have again the

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
name you have an id

290
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,399
and you have a little description but

291
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
you don't really have how you can

292
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,480
perform those things and i believe this

293
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
is coming in in the near future for now

294
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
i it's sad to say and i feel a bit bad

295
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,480
by seeing that but i think it lacks real

296
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,600
content

297
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
um but i think that once it's more

298
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,240
public and people start working with it

299
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,399
uh the content will come so definitely a

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,480
project that you should check out

301
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
we've talked about maybe merging our

302
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
project and we didn't do it at this time

303
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,200
but it's still on the table it might

304
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,720
happen

305
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
i believe in early june so when i was

306
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
sorry just about to send these slides to

307
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,079
sans i came across osmond songer or

308
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,519
sonder i'm not sure exactly how he

309
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,360
pronounced his name

310
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,760
brand new also open

311
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,959
playbook

312
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,279
project and you have the

313
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
github link here

314
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
is his goal is to build playbook for

315
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,000
every minor technique

316
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,399
um i tried that in the past i think

317
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,800
there's again a lot of overlap if you do

318
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
that because lots of techniques are

319
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,720
investigated pretty much the same

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,279
i would tend to go more at the technique

321
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
level but anyway i wish him good luck i

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,920
think it's going to help a lot of people

323
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
to have all of those playbooks and

324
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
another thing that i found extremely

325
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
interesting in this project is that he

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
wants to build exercise scenarios that

327
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
can be used for training purposes so

328
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,800
what it means is if you build a cool

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,959
tabletop exercise with your team you can

330
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,680
push it there and then everybody can

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
use that scenario after that to train

332
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
their own sock so that that's one thing

333
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,000
that i think is also very interesting

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
lots of people are talking about

335
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,079
building tabletop exercise and as far as

336
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,880
i know not many people are actually

337
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,399
sharing those scenarios even though

338
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,440
they're not

339
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
most of the time they're pretty generic

340
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
and i think they could be shared very

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,279
easily

342
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
now it is demo time so let's spray the

343
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
demo god and here you have the url for

344
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,959
our playbook

345
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,399
and they're not

346
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,800
currently public i'll do that uh in a

347
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
few minutes when we're at the end of the

348
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
um

349
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,480
the end of the talk i'm gonna do it uh

350
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,440
captain jesus style and yolo it live

351
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,920
and put that

352
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
live so let's

353
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,560
can you confirm that you can see the the

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,079
project and it's still sharing

355
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,800
uh yeah i can see it material okay thank

356
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,079
you thank you

357
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:52,480
um

358
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,619
[Music]

359
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,399
so this is the the format it looks like

360
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,519
so it's it's a typical git lab or github

361
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,120
a project

362
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,360
you have a few placeholder for example

363
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,279
here you have anything that you would

364
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
want to have for your different customer

365
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
if you're more of a mssp type of

366
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
organization or maybe you could put

367
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,440
information about some

368
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,680
business compromise everything that

369
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
starts with irp

370
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,639
is an incident response playbook

371
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,800
and the name of the playbook comes right

372
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,079
after

373
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
here in product

374
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
sorry you would have things like

375
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,320
uh

376
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,079
all the different product that you may

377
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,160
use and i just threw a bunch here right

378
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
now they're all empty uh but you can

379
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
edit and how you make different thing

380
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,639
how would you create an account in all

381
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
of these um

382
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
product could be one of the thing that

383
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
that would go in there how do you

384
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
retrieve a keycap like i mentioned

385
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,360
just earlier

386
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
and finally tools is more something it's

387
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,959
more like open

388
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,320
open source tool or free tools um

389
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,240
you can quickly go through here

390
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
something like talos intelligence url

391
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
void ipvoid

392
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,519
thread crowd cyber chef

393
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,839
a bunch

394
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,839
some free sandbox or at least that they

395
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,120
have some some level of free services

396
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
um

397
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,639
now because i said we're not going to do

398
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
fish i'm going to go for account

399
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,519
compromise and if you remember the

400
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
screenshot i showed

401
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,480
for chris's playbook you'll find this

402
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
very familiar so first of all it starts

403
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
with a table of contents and if you

404
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,800
click on something it will bring you to

405
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,160
the right place

406
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
but right now we're not going to do that

407
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
one thing that i like here is that

408
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
preparation and detect are almost the

409
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,759
same for all playbooks so i start them

410
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,759
collapse because most of the time anyway

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,959
when your

412
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,680
analyst will jump into the playbook

413
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,320
they'll already be at the analyze phase

414
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
um they'll be prepared hopefully you've

415
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
prepared them well and the detection

416
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
part should have already happened but

417
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
i'll still expand

418
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,279
at least the text so you can have a

419
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
look and feel

420
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,839
for it

421
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,120
but basically

422
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,639
you start with an alert or a

423
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,000
notification

424
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,320
for me alerts they kind of come

425
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,560
from your organization and or your

426
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
security tools that you already have

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
whereas notification

428
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,800
would be something that comes from

429
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
a third party like a you're your user or

430
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,240
um or someone that says hey you're

431
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,360
hosting some phishing website on on on

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,519
your infrastructure

433
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
after that you need to identify the risk

434
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,959
factor the common ones and the one that

435
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,440
might be org specific

436
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
but it's still there arc specific

437
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
sometimes but this is from chris uh

438
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,320
template so i think

439
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,839
that's one of the point i also wanted to

440
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,800
make uh earlier is that playbooks a lot

441
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,199
of people

442
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,279
the reason they give to not share them

443
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,600
is that they are extremely org specific

444
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
and i really have a problem with that i

445
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,400
would argue that maybe the

446
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
work instruction can be very org

447
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,959
specific because this they depict

448
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
the product you have and how you do

449
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,119
things within your organization but most

450
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,199
of these steps they're extremely generic

451
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,199
and everybody does that i mean everybody

452
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,520
looks for the file hash on virustotal

453
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,439
this is not intellectual property

454
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,280
everybody does that and that's why it's

455
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,679
in there and it's the same thing um even

456
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,160
here it says org specific but reputation

457
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
damage financial loss is the same thing

458
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,840
that's going to happen pretty much to

459
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
everyone that's suffer a breach

460
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
um and yeah finally you you collect the

461
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
data you do the triage is this a false

462
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,799
positive or not if it's a false positive

463
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
of course you stop here and otherwise

464
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
you go to the next phase with which is

465
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
analyzed

466
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
down here you have

467
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,919
a more text version of it and the goal

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
here would be that all of these things

469
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,520
are clickable um so how do you manage

470
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
tickets how do you do things in your

471
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,640
steam how do you manage the antivirus

472
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
your dns proxies and

473
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,039
what i would like from the community is

474
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,120
actually go there and fill

475
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
those things and create those links

476
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,120
um to the

477
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,919
so it's more complete and can help more

478
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,919
people

479
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,559
now if we go here if you don't like to

480
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,400
see the graph

481
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,640
you can also collapse everything and you

482
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
can collapse the whole section as well

483
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,880
and you come to contain and eradicate

484
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
and this is also

485
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
in the markdown you can decide which

486
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,880
ones you open or closed as you also you

487
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
could only show the um

488
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
the graph the workflow if that's enough

489
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,320
for your team or you can expand

490
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,640
everything it's really up to you how you

491
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
do these things

492
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
so for account compromise typically or

493
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,600
when you get to the detect phase uh you

494
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
would start by verifying so you double

495
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,880
check with a senior analyst for example

496
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,679
that

497
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
all the data is right and this is indeed

498
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,880
a true positive and then you move on one

499
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
of the thing that you might have noticed

500
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
on this framework that is slightly

501
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
different from chris's format is that

502
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,559
every

503
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,200
piece of the workflow has this little

504
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
letter on top like here you see aa

505
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,039
1 aa2 aa3 this stands for uh the first a

506
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,039
is for analyze because we're in the

507
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,559
analyze phase and the second one is the

508
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,440
name of the playbook account compromise

509
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,760
and then it's just a sequential number

510
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,799
so when when you talk with your team uh

511
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
or when the incident commander talks to

512
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,880
the team you can say hey are we done

513
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
with aa3 and everybody knows what aa3

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
actually is

515
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,120
and it's because sometimes some of the

516
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,200
faces you need to do more than one time

517
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,640
so you can have something that you do in

518
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
analyze or in containment that you need

519
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,080
to do again in the recovery so that make

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,840
sure that we're talking about the exact

521
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
same box in the workflow

522
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
um so let's continue here uh

523
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,600
okay you're gonna gather a list of

524
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
affected uh credentials probably the uh

525
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,440
affected computer as well

526
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,679
or asset then you will

527
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,600
assess the level of privilege that was

528
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,919
gained by the attacker and you'll decide

529
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
if this is a critical incident if it's a

530
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,840
critical incident you'll go to your

531
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
critical incident playbook and then

532
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,039
you'll come back

533
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,400
to this playbook and the way uh

534
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,360
i built this um

535
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,559
framework is that you might run many

536
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,720
playbook at the same time so if you have

537
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
a ransomware for example you'll probably

538
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,000
run

539
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
the ransomware or the ransom playbook

540
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,880
the malware playbook the account

541
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
compromise playbook and the critical

542
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,960
playbook at the same time and if you

543
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
know that you've lost data well that's a

544
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,679
fifth a playbook that you might run in

545
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,159
parallel you might run the uh

546
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,000
the data loss playbook

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
so that's why these numbers are

548
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,600
extremely important because they are the

549
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
same

550
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,200
uh

551
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,880
some of the names are pretty much the

552
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,559
same

553
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,679
um do we have a compromise domain yes or

554
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,080
no but we have a live threat actor so we

555
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,000
might take some action differently if we

556
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,720
know the actor is still inside uh as

557
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,039
opposed to a more smash and grab type of

558
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,240
attack

559
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
do we have any backups now

560
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
everything is about ransomware these

561
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
days so if you if you have

562
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,559
backups you want to protect them like

563
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,799
very early in the process so even though

564
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,919
this

565
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,080
uh part might be for some people

566
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,040
consider more um

567
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,200
[Music]

568
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,030
remedy

569
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,480
[Music]

570
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,799
contain or or something like that i

571
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,320
still think that it's important to do it

572
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
as early as possible so you'll see

573
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,440
things sometimes um that are not exactly

574
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
where where you might think but there's

575
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,039
a reason for that

576
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,760
uh log analysis uh is there any password

577
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
reuse

578
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
uh what what exactly what what type of

579
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,159
access was stolen mfa it was that text

580
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,919
filtrated we talked about that then you

581
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
would start the database playbook and

582
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
then of course you come back to the same

583
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,480
thing

584
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,679
do we have have we identified everything

585
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,720
yes or no and if yes

586
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,960
we continue otherwise we do that loop

587
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
again i'm gonna speed up a little bit i

588
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,679
think we're getting a bit short on time

589
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,840
uh then you'll look for your root cause

590
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,240
analysis do we need legal help do we

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
need technical help and then you'll

592
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
contact the proper

593
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
people that you might have on your

594
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,559
retainer

595
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,360
um the root cause analysis send

596
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,520
communication to

597
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,840
your internal folks your security people

598
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
maybe your customer if you have any

599
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,440
um

600
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
well you have customers otherwise you

601
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,200
wouldn't have a business but i mean um

602
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,000
either corporate or even personal uh

603
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,640
people dependent so again here you have

604
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
all of the steps more in

605
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,880
detail like this i'm gonna stick to the

606
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
workflow i think it's gonna be enough

607
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
uh for the level

608
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
of knowledge of the folks that i believe

609
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
are on this talk

610
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
um so here we are at the contain and

611
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,240
eradicate phase so we of course disable

612
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,039
accounts we reset the password we power

613
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
down non-encrypted system this is a box

614
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
that was caught of course from the

615
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,120
ransom playbook but you might want to

616
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,440
have it there just in good measure uh

617
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,480
you always

618
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,039
better say than sorry of course restrict

619
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,120
your privileges if you can if you know

620
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,039
that some of the

621
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,360
accounts that are compromised are some

622
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
in some very powerful group maybe you

623
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,919
can just remove them from those group

624
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,640
remove any cache credential

625
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,520
contain the endpoint

626
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,640
block network traffic and then again

627
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
did we id everything or did we discover

628
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,480
new iocs and then you would go back in

629
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,640
that group or go to the recover shapes

630
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
um

631
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
so like the recovery phase of course

632
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,559
we're gonna now update our defenses lift

633
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
containment and all of those things

634
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,320
we're gonna change all the passwords

635
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
sometimes again uh especially in the

636
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
case of a curb tgd password if we

637
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,440
believe that was compromised then we

638
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,039
would remove anything that we put in

639
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,080
place uh as counter measure or other

640
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
other ways to get in our environment for

641
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
example if we create a temporary vpn or

642
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,760
some jump box or some citrix that we've

643
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
exposed to the internet to allow our

644
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,919
instant response team to get in but not

645
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,360
the adversary

646
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,679
we would remove all of those things

647
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
we would start rebuilding the systems

648
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,720
of course from clean media same thing

649
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
restore the back the the data

650
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,679
hopefully you have protected your your

651
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,600
backups and then

652
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
uh we would do some audit of our

653
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,880
internal facing services

654
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
finally we get to the post-incident

655
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,510
um

656
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,039
[Music]

657
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,919
phase

658
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
and here it's also pretty

659
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,520
straightforward i believe incident

660
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,520
review with all of your team what worked

661
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,159
what didn't work what could you improve

662
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,400
uh you update your policy and procedures

663
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,279
if you find that there's a lack in there

664
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,360
you would review again your defensive

665
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
posture um you would review

666
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
you would schedule right now something

667
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,080
that you review your rule that you just

668
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
created maybe in six months

669
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,440
um

670
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
and

671
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,840
see if the things are still applicable

672
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
that you've put during your instant

673
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,400
response you would update upgrade your

674
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,120
defenses if you're still running a good

675
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,240
old antivirus you might want to update

676
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,039
and upgrade the signature or the engine

677
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
if you have an um an edr you want to

678
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
make sure that the behavior now if there

679
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,200
was a malware

680
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,320
is

681
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,960
taken care of by your edr vendor

682
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,679
um you want to build new detection and

683
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,799
maybe you see some cm rules some tickets

684
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
that is sent to your sock

685
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,000
and then

686
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,159
you would maybe modify your base image

687
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
or change your hardening procedures

688
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
was the incident caused by a human if

689
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,080
yes you might want to look into your

690
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
user awareness program to include

691
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,679
the type of behavior that was done to

692
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,440
make sure that it's not performed again

693
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,240
by other people pretty sure the person

694
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,960
that did it won't do it again but still

695
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,559
there's probably a lot of people in your

696
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,320
org so it's important that everyone

697
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,080
understands what happened of course

698
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
we're not here to blame a person it's

699
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,080
just to educate

700
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,520
your corporation

701
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,600
then we calculate the incident cost and

702
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,000
that's the end of the instance response

703
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
so i hope it was clear

704
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
and that it was

705
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,600
good enough

706
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,440
really good enough i mean that that you

707
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
enjoyed the format and that you will use

708
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,159
it

709
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,400
uh here i have

710
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
um how to create a new playbook so for

711
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,440
example if you want to create the ddos

712
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,559
playbook uh you would call it irp

713
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,760
ddos

714
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,679
and you would create a file that would

715
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,720
call readme.md inside your new folder

716
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
and you paste the content from the

717
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,159
template which is rp template

718
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,520
dot md

719
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,520
then you would do a find and replace

720
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,760
dash name dash with the name of your

721
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,480
playbook for example ddos in all of the

722
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,240
documents and then you can start editing

723
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,799
the documents and changing uh the themes

724
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,679
for

725
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,360
for the workflows

726
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,799
um

727
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,640
you go inside uh

728
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
inside your folder and you create a

729
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,279
workflows directory and then you open

730
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
the workflow template in draw io you

731
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
save locally

732
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,200
this you can you can do it on online but

733
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
be careful because as you edit this is a

734
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
kind of pro tip and if you have a

735
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,679
trackpad like i do and you

736
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:58,799
swipe

737
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,080
like this

738
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
you will lose your thing it will you

739
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,039
will do it back and you'll lose

740
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,640
everything so that's why i say save

741
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,440
often or use the

742
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
local application of draw io that will

743
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
save you a lot of nightmare trust me it

744
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,559
happened to me and it's not fun to redo

745
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,559
all of the tabs and all of the little

746
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,480
box and the little lines when you're

747
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,399
almost done

748
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
once you have all your faces done you

749
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,200
use file export as png in draw io and

750
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,440
you save all of these tabs and you put

751
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,320
them in that workflow directory

752
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,360
um

753
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,520
and there you go you're fine you just

754
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
look make sure that the names are the

755
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
same as in the markdown

756
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,919
subfolder i talked about them already

757
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,600
during the demo i just put it there in

758
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
case someone is looking at this

759
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,919
in the future and has not has the chance

760
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,000
to hear my awesome french canadian

761
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
accent

762
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
how you can contribute well it's quite

763
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
easy it's on gitlab as i mentioned so we

764
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
can clone and fork the repo you can add

765
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,320
modify content as your art pleases and

766
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,080
you can use the template of course you

767
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,320
can modify the templates if you feel

768
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
that there's a section that is missing

769
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,159
i mean by all means update the templates

770
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,039
as well you can submit a pull request

771
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,279
for those who are really into

772
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,440
contributing you could help build some

773
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,919
pipeline for ci cd and auto merge and

774
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,720
stuff like that if anyone knows how to

775
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,760
automate draw i o from a markdown to a

776
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,159
graph that would be awesome that would

777
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,679
save so much time um and for some people

778
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,960
that uh

779
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
helped a lot they could even become

780
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,760
maintainer

781
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,559
now this is a slide i really like um

782
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,000
because in my opinion it represents

783
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,360
how we the defender can stand up to the

784
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,640
red team and adversary if we unite

785
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,919
um

786
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,039
we are we are bigger we far outnumber

787
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,320
them and yet in most cases i feel that

788
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,640
we're always trying to catching up with

789
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,600
them

790
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,679
and i feel like especially the red team

791
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,120
they share more

792
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,080
they contribute more and

793
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
there's always more things published

794
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,880
about red teaming than blue teaming and

795
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,240
that's one of the reason why i really

796
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,960
wanted to open source this project and

797
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,520
give back to the community that given me

798
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
so much

799
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,600
um

800
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
i think that everyone can share these

801
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
things i don't think it's true that it's

802
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,480
intellectual property i mean as i said

803
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,159
before i think most of these things

804
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,360
everybody does or should do and i'm sure

805
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
there's a lot of things that are missing

806
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
that you can contribute if your

807
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,600
organization doesn't allow you to be

808
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
publicly

809
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,120
like in their name maybe you could ask

810
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,000
ask them if you can publish under a an

811
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,399
alias a name that is not related either

812
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,279
to you a new persona that it's not

813
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,279
linked to your company but anyway i

814
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,480
think there's a lot of way you can

815
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
contribute back to this project

816
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,440
i wish that this

817
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
project becomes

818
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,000
the

819
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,559
equivalent of sigma for detection rule

820
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,559
or atomic rating

821
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,320
for

822
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,240
for building

823
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,760
attacks

824
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,240
we'll see what happens in the future

825
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,559
this is the end of the talk so thank you

826
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,960
very much for all of you who attended i

827
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720

i want also to thank sans for allowing

831
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
me to talk here today it was a great

832
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
experience it was a great summit and i

833
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,919
couldn't think of a better place to

834
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,799
actually open source uh this project so

835
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,440
thank you very much

836
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,240
one last thing i need to also uh thank

837
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,320
my employer syntax because i don't think

838
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
there's a lot of employer that would

839
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,360
have open source uh playbooks like this

840
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,039
that would allow this i've worked at

841
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,760
many places before and most of them

842
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,840
wouldn't have allowed us to to do

843
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,440
something like this

844
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,080
so thank you

845
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,279
[Laughter]

846
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,360
that's all i can say but you know really

847
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,760
exceptionally wonderful presentation i

848
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
was just looking through

849
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
um your your hallway as you were talking

850
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
and like all the wonderful things coming

851
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,200
through and everybody was really

852
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,039
impressed with the work that you've done

853
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,480
i think you've done you've done a

854
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,039
phenomenal piece of research you know um

855
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,200
how you've put the playbooks together

856
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,039
and things along those lines so this is

857
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,720
this is absolutely

858
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,440
um fantastic fantastic research there

859
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
were a few questions that came through

860
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,200
on the zoom channel that i'd just like

861
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,760
to share with you um one of them came

862
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,559
from

863
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,960
wolfgang loo who asked if these

864
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,519
playbooks could be ported into a source

865
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,919
solution something like resilient

866
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
um curious to see your your views on

867
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
that

868
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,480
well the steps can but it's not it's

869
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,640
right now they're more

870
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,600
um

871
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,559
it's more a process than a procedure and

872
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
i believe in in a sword you'd be more at

873
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,519
the procedure level and those uh we

874
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,279
didn't share yet same thing for the

875
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,320
incidence response plan uh this this i

876
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
think the incidence response plan is

877
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,399
more uh dear and and very close to an

878
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,399
organization it shares a little bit less

879
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,519
than than a process right yeah um but

880
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,120
yeah for the for the other question for

881
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,360
the store um i mean

882
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,120
if if some people can help build the um

883
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,480
the procedure part of the work

884
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
instruction part yes it could probably

885
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,600
be ported we could probably have

886
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,919
something enamel but at the time that

887
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,000
were like right now i would say that

888
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,360
there is no

889
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,440
yeah i was you know one thing that that

890
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
i was really impressed with as well when

891
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,720
you were talking about you know how we

892
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,960
stronger together and i think you know

893
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,360
as i've said when i started off today's

894
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,799
um session

895
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,399
one of the things with the dfir

896
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,399
community in general around the world as

897
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
we really really do help each other out

898
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,559
you know we really have a mission and a

899
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,880
you know a purpose a cause we really

900
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,600
believe in so you know your call to the

901
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,519
community you know to get involved is

902
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,799
quite great because actually a few

903
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,640
people that jumped into your hallway

904
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
straight away saying hey um you know

905
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,599
we've got uh i just want to check

906
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,639
um

907
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,719
milan ceramic was basically saying hey

908
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,960
what about this for doing uh markdown

909
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,719
and flow charts so there's like lots of

910
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
good ideas coming through

911
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,918
uh on your hallway so i'm sure you're

912
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:23,280
going to look at them and say well okay

913
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,960
that's that was pretty cool

914
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
um so so

915
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,280
um one of the things another question

916
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,839
came through on the channel was from uh

917
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,399
michael hessler basically saying um you

918
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,239
know in terms of the gaps with current

919
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,079
playbooks are there specific things you

920
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,079
would like the community to help bold

921
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,879
with

922
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,280
um and i know you had that call for the

923
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,119
community to get involved oh yeah i

924
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,520
think nobody is like preparing to go

925
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,199
yeah so i think i said it in the

926
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,079
presentation but maybe i speak too fast

927
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,159
uh but if people could help with the

928
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
product part and the the more the

929
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,800
procedure part and start building that

930
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
for tool that they use um i think then

931
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,280
most people could share

932
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,800
right um

933
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
how you do things in different vendors

934
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
uh you know if you have access to

935
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
microsoft atp or or crowdstrike or

936
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
carbon black or silence or all of those

937
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,680
things you know

938
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,960
we cannot

939
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,760
uh have them all of course in our in our

940
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
testing so we cannot build them for all

941
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,000
the product that we don't own so if the

942
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
people can start feeding in then we

943
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,440
could also feed more um of what we have

944
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,800
because one of the thing is that we

945
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
don't necessarily want to tell everyone

946
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,560
exactly which product we are using but

947
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,280
again as i said myself we can contribute

948
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,520
more anonymously at some point as well

949
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,359
but in this presentation those are

950
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
things that were intentionally left out

951
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
yeah no and then understandably i mean

952
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,079
what was really nice is just looking at

953
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,000
this the sort of conceptual framework

954
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,440
that you've built

955
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,599
um which really just

956
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,520
i look i'm i'm i'm a i'm an

957
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,040
old-fashioned site in the sense that i

958
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,359
like to see sort of processes you know

959
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,079
my my brain works well with processes

960
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,480
um so this was really really brilliant

961
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,040
and and also a very useful tip that you

962
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,640
gave out to the community when using

963
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,880
draw.io about the

964
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,160
swiping on the trackpad as as a draw.i

965
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,440
user i'm video i've also had that dope

966
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,680
moment before uh when i've been working

967
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,879
on process diagrams

968
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
never again for major uh work i'm gonna

969
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,760
use the web interface so yeah yeah i i i

970
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
i

971
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
i i regret that i ever did that that's a

972
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,760
good advice um yeah i i bet but uh but

973
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,839
here the the your president is really

974
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,440
brilliant like i said you know like by

975
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
by very limited french you know tray

976
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
might if you kiddo it's really

977
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
um you know really excellent uh you know
