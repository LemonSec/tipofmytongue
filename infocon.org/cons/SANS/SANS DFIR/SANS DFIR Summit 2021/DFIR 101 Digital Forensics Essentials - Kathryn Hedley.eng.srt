1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
all right so i am going to introduce

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
catherine here before

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,559
i eat up any of her time but before i

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,040
introduce her katherine headley sam's

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
instructor i've had the honor of

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,080
teaching with her

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,800
being in paris shut down with her

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,039
experiencing total chaos during coven

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,439
but kat is brilliant um

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
she knows so much the way that

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,039
you explain things cat like as a

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
seasoned stand instructor sitting back

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
and watching you break it down to a

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
level that everyone has a way to

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,280
approach the topic is fantastic and

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
that's why i really appreciate you doing

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
something like this d4 101 because

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
sometimes we take things that make them

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
so complex in our worlds and they really

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,960
don't need to be so thank you for your

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
approach that everyone can take

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,120
something away from i really appreciate

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,160
it

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,719
all right thanks scott

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
well sam thank you very much

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
and thank you to all of you lovely

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,719
lovely people who are

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
on the other end of this call uh good

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,240
morning good afternoon good evening

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
because i appreciate there's a mixture

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
of those those things in here

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
cool and yeah so i'm going to

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
talk to you for the next

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
uh hour and a bit on on digital

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,439
forensics what that means

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,560
and and how we kind of break it down

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,799
uh into first of all what is digital

38
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,119
evidence because if we don't understand

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,560
the evidence that we're dealing with

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,159
then how do we start to explain

41
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,280
forensics

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
then starting to talk about an

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
investigation what that process is and

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
and what it kind of means in terms of

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
digital forensics then i'm actually

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
going to talk about digital forensics

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,439
because that's what we're all here for

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,759
and last but not least

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
why am i talking about this how does

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,079
this actually help people what does

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
digital forensics do

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,799
and

53
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
what kind of results can we get from

54
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,479
that so that's that's the the process

55
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,600
i'm going to go through and what i'm

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
going to talk about today

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
and first of all uh in case anybody

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,759
doesn't know what dfir stands for

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,360
because i appreciate that is plastered

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,600
all over the summit all over my slides

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,399
i've called this defer 101

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
just digital forensics and incident

63
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,720
response it is it's a common acronym

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,080
that we use

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,400
and i am referring to digital forensics

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
a lot in this presentation so i'm

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
focusing more on the df side of that

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
acronym but i will touch on instant

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,560
response as well so just to give you a

70
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
flavor of what that is and and how that

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,959
translates as well

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
across

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,760
i've lost my buttons again

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
there we go

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
hey cool okay so first thing what do i

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
mean by digital evidence

77
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
i simply mean it's digital information

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
that may be of potential

79
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,720
of potential relevance to my

80
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
investigation that is either stored or

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
transmitted

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
in some sort of digital format on some

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
sort of digital device or traversing a

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,640
network of some sort

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,239
and that breaks down into what we call

86
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,959
data and metadata

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
data is just information that can be

88
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,519
transmitted or processed it's just

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,840
digital information of some sort

90
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,920
metadata is also data it's a specific

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,800
type of data that provides information

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,440
about other data so data that describes

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
other data

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
and when we talk about digital evidence

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
we are talking about these two things

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
and what does that mean in real life

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,560
i have a photograph here uh this

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
photograph

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
uh was actually taken in australia um

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
looking out on the on the great barrier

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
reef so this photograph you can see

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
there's a boat there's some trees that

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,360
photograph itself is data that's just

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
what i mean by data it's it's files on

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,040
the system it is content

106
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,200
metadata

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
is information that's describing that so

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,840
it's things like the file name the size

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
the created timestamp the time that that

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
file was last modified

111
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,480
the path the file path for that

112
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,239
particular file

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,879
and that is data as i say that describes

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,680
it it's not the photograph itself

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
and talking about metadata there are

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
actually

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
two different types of metadata

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,520
just to complicate things a little bit

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,479
further

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
there is metadata that is stored

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,759
completely separate to the file and that

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
is what we call file system metadata and

123
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,600
i'll come on to explain what i mean by a

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,800
file system

125
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
but that is metadata that is stored

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
on the system

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
not anywhere near the file itself or not

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
within the file itself

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
it's dependent on the type of file

130
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,199
system that you have

131
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
and this includes things like the file

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,000
name timestamps file size all those

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
things i showed you on that previous

134
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
slide

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
you then have potentially a second type

136
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
of metadata this is dependent on the

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,639
file type so some types of file things

138
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,680
like

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,320
jpeg photographs things like microsoft

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,919
word documents

141
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,919
both doc and docx

142
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,880
things like

143
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,840
excel spreadsheets things like

144
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
pdf documents

145
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
these files

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
have a specific structure

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
and within that structure

148
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,560
includes or may include some metadata

149
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,320
and i say may um because it isn't always

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
there the structure basically allows for

151
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
that metadata but when that file is

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,720
created

153
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
that is or modified that's the point

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
where that metadata may or may not be

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,400
written

156
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
for example this might include things

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
like

158
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
another created timestamp it might

159
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
include the author name so in a word

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,440
document

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
you if you go and see the properties and

162
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000
open up that file tab you can enter your

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,319
name as the author name you can enter

164
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
comments keywords

165
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,560
all sorts of a description for the

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,520
document a title for the document that's

167
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,400
all embedded metadata within the file

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,759
and because it's embedded within the

169
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,960
file itself we call it file metadata but

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
it is heavily dependent on the type of

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
file because that dictates that

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,560
structure and that dictates what

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
metadata can be stored within that

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
particular file but just because it can

175
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
be stored doesn't mean it always is so

176
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
you may or may not find that metadata

177
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
within that file but the file system

178
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,319
metadata will always be there because

179
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
that's dependent on the file system not

180
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,280
the file itself so for every file

181
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,600
created on that system there will be

182
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
file system metadata

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
how much metadata depends on the file

184
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
system but there will be some metadata

185
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
there within the file system

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
and just to show you the difference

187
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
between these two this is another jpeg

188
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,840
file

189
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
and on the left hand side as you look at

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,800
this you have the file system metadata

191
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
which is as i said things like file name

192
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,160
created created timestamp the path the

193
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,479
size all of those types of things

194
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560
on the right hand side i appreciate it's

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
really small writing but it you don't

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,560
need to read it it's just to show the

197
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
magnitude of how much data can be in

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
file metadata can be embedded within

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,960
that file and particularly for a jpeg

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
it can be a lot it can be a heck of a

201
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
lot you can have exposure information

202
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
whether the flash went off the

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
dimensions of the photograph the created

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
timestamp the make and model of camera

205
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
that took that photograph the camera

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,759
serial number potentially if it's a

207
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,120
digital camera

208
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,080
you can have gps latitude and longitude

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
for the location where that photograph

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
was taken

211
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
uh you can have all sorts of things in

212
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,879
there so

213
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,440
that's just a very small snapshot shown

214
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
in in this this screen

215
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,199
of the type of metadata that you may or

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,840
may not get

217
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,599
and there's more

218
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,560
there's there's often often more

219
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,520
things like a word document

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
might include the person who last saved

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,440
that document the author's name

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
how many words are in that document how

223
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,319
many paragraphs are in that document

224
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
how many hours have been spent editing

225
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
that particular file

226
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
the date and time the file was created

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
the date and time the file was last

228
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,199
printed and saved

229
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
lots and lots of data can be embedded

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
within these types of document

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,640
and

232
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
it's not just the data

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,320
that is potentially useful to us the

234
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,399
data itself the content of the word

235
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
document

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,360
might be might be useful it might be a

237
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
manual on how to make bombs and if we're

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,600
looking for terrorist information in a

239
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
terrorist case or um that sort of case

240
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
that is relevant to us and we're going

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,320
to want to look at that

242
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
but we also want to know who created

243
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,560
that document who last

244
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,880
modified that document how much time

245
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,399
potentially was spent editing that

246
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
document that may show more of an intent

247
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,399
to

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,480
to create that particular content so all

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
of these things are just as helpful to

250
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
us

251
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,240
potentially more in in some cases

252
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,480
so that's why we we're kind of

253
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
i'm talking to you about both of these

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
things and highlighting that these

255
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
things exist

256
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,040
and i just want to

257
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,760
illustrate that point by talking about

258
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,240
one of my favorite cases

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
to talk about which is of the btk killer

260
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
now the btk killer was a guy called

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
dennis raider he nicknamed himself heard

262
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
the btk killer

263
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,360
as you do you know um stands for bind

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
torture kill because that's what he did

265
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,920
to all of his victims

266
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,640
he killed at least 10 people that we

267
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,440
know of potentially a lot more that we

268
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
don't know of they are the ones that

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,959
that he

270
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,279
kind of confessed to in the end

271
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,240
and

272
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
he got away with it for about 30 odd

273
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
years the police didn't have a clue who

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,519
he was

275
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,800
and

276
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
he got a bit cocky because of this he

277
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,480
got very very confident because nobody

278
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,959
was was coming after him

279
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
and he therefore decided to start

280
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,760
basically taunting the police he was

281
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
sending

282
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
letters to the media he was sending

283
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
leaving letters and things lying around

284
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,399
in things like um i think it was home

285
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
depot he left he left something

286
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,480
and they were being passed to the police

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
to say i i did this murder i i killed

288
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,040
this particular person naming that

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,880
person and leaving things like id from

290
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,839
the victim to prove that that he was

291
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,800
responsible for these and he would leave

292
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,279
them in cereal boxes as a nod to being a

293
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,640
serial killer

294
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
so he really was

295
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,320
confident and and very messed up um

296
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,360
however

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
one of these

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
items one of the cereal boxes that he

299
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
left for the police

300
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,040
in it he wrote a letter asking the

301
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
police

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
if he was to give the police a floppy

303
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,320
disk drive

304
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,560
yes this was in the the

305
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
actual this was early 2000's he was

306
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
sending these so around about uh 2003

307
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,320
2004

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,680
he uh he sent this saying if i if i gave

309
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,600
you a floppy disk drive would you be

310
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,519
able to trace it back to me tell me the

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
truth be honest with me i i'm trusting

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,240
you to be honest with me

313
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
will you be able to trace that back to

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
me and of course the police seized this

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,880
opportunity and responded in in through

316
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
the media that's how they were

317
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,120
communicating with him to say no no we

318
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
we can't do this there's no way we can

319
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
we can trace anything back to you if you

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
give us a floppy disk drive

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,279
and

322
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,440
dennis rader thought great okay

323
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
brilliant so he gave them a floppy disk

324
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
drive

325
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,600
and

326
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,639
on it

327
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,800
was the letter that he'd written for the

328
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
police

329
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
but also there was a deleted

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
word document deleted microsoft word

331
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,040
document and within that particular

332
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,760
document there was metadata that showed

333
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,760
that the last person who saved that

334
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,920
particular file was somebody called

335
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,360
dennis

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,040
there was also metadata within that

337
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,839
document that pointed to a particular

338
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,360
church

339
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,399
and

340
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,519
doing a search on the internet for that

341
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,320
church and somebody called dennis came

342
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
up with dennis raider because he was

343
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
heavily involved in the church at the

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,399
time and it was very straightforward to

345
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,880
make that link so they went knocking and

346
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
they arrested him

347
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
and as they did his immediate reaction

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,440
was

349
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,160
just surprise and anger because the

350
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
police had lied to him it wasn't the

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
fact he'd been caught it was the fact

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,720
the police had specifically said no we

353
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
can't trace you from a floppy disk drive

354
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
and then they did simply through the

355
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,360
metadata of a deleted docx file so just

356
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,160
to emphasize metadata can be extremely

357
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,480
useful and in that case

358
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
the the content of the the document

359
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,279
itself wasn't of particular interest so

360
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,720
the data itself wasn't wasn't that

361
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
relevant but the metadata was what got

362
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
them to to to get their guy and he went

363
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,680
to prison for a very long time

364
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,079
as well as understanding

365
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,160
what data and metadata are

366
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,399
we also need to understand

367
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,120
how to interpret that data how to show

368
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,800
its potential relevance to our

369
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
investigation

370
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
and to do that we first need to

371
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,199
understand how that data is stored on an

372
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,680
electronic device

373
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,279
data is stored

374
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,360
in a few different layers

375
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,959
most users

376
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,760
don't kind of go below the operating

377
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
system they use applications so at the

378
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,800
moment i am talking to you using zoom

379
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,560
which is an application that is running

380
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,040
on all of our systems

381
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,120
that application is installed on the

382
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
operating system

383
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
so maybe you're running windows maybe

384
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
you're running mac os maybe you're

385
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
running linux or android or ios if

386
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
you're on a smartphone

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
that operating system

388
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
is something we interact with and we

389
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,279
also interact with the applications but

390
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,880
the applications sit on top of the

391
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,800
operating system

392
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,519
underneath that is is what i'm going to

393
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,880
to run through

394
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,160
next

395
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
so starting with the bottom of that

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,199
pyramid

397
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
data is stored in binary in bits and

398
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
bytes

399
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,399
it's stored it is is ones and zeros a

400
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,720
single zero or a single one is called a

401
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,440
bit bits are grouped together into sets

402
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
of eight which are called bytes

403
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
and

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
half a byte is a nibble so if you think

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,760
of if you take a big bite out of

406
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
something or you nibble it

407
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,120
a nibble is is half a byte or four bits

408
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,199
it's otherwise potentially known as base

409
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,160
two you may hear it called base two and

410
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,680
that's simply because there are two

411
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,639
potential options for each bit there's a

412
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,680
zero or there's a one

413
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
and

414
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
this is this is just to illustrate what

415
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
it looks like we have one byte here

416
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
which is zero one zero zero zero zero

417
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
zero one

418
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
all of that is is one byte

419
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,199
that is our data we we can see that's

420
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,839
the the contents of the data

421
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
we also need to know how to interpret

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
that and there are many different ways

423
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,680
that we can interpret that particular

424
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,560
byte

425
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,440
for example the capital letter a in in

426
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,519
the ascii character set so in the

427
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
english language

428
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
is is this is is stored like this as one

429
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
byte so that's just one way of

430
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,399
interpreting this particular byte of

431
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,800
data and we need to have those two bits

432
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
of information we need to know what the

433
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,079
data is and how to interpret that data

434
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,480
in order to make sense of it analyze it

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,519
and do our investigation

436
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,880
but we don't

437
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,079
look we don't talk in bytes uh it would

438
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,800
take forever for me to say okay

439
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,600
uh i have this bite zero zero zero one

440
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
one zero one one and yeah we we don't

441
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,560
talk that way we tend to talk in

442
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
hexadecimal as digital forensic

443
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,839
examiners

444
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
before i talk about hexadecimal i just

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
want to break down a numbering system

446
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,360
that is more familiar to everybody

447
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,600
in decimal most most of us think in

448
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,320
decimal in in normal everyday life and

449
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,000
mathematics

450
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
and if we think about

451
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,480
how we break down decimal numbers that

452
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,839
helps us to

453
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
better understand things like

454
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,120
hexadecimal which is a different way of

455
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
looking at the same data

456
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
decimal otherwise known as base 10

457
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,120
because we have 10

458
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
options we have the numbers not to nine

459
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,639
if we have the number one two three four

460
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,680
five

461
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
we can automatically read that as twelve

462
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,360
thousand three hundred and forty five

463
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
because this is the numbering system

464
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
that we use every day

465
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
but if we break that down

466
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
what you actually have is five ones four

467
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
tens three hundreds two thousands and

468
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
one ten thousand

469
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,760
otherwise known as five times ten to the

470
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
zero because ten to the zero is one four

471
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,480
times ten to the one three times ten to

472
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
the two two times ten to the three and

473
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
one times 10 to the 4. so you can see

474
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,959
our multipliers as as we go across we

475
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,319
start from the right hand side and we go

476
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
10 to the power 0 10 to the power 1 10

477
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,880
to the power 2 and all the way along

478
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
and and that's how we

479
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
we break it down and we understand that

480
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
number

481
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,080
in hexadecimal instead of having just

482
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
10 options we have 16 options so this is

483
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,480
known as base 16.

484
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
we have the numbers not to nine but we

485
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
then extend that character set

486
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
by basically carrying on counting 10 11

487
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
12 13 14 15

488
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
but we have to

489
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
put those into single characters so

490
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,080
instead of 10 we say a

491
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
instead of 11 we say b

492
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,280
and and so on so we get

493
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,400
0 to 9 a to f as we go through

494
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,799
and as you can see in this table

495
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,760
each

496
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,640
hexadecimal value is 4 bits it's a

497
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,440
nibble so when i talk about a byte of

498
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
data

499
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
i will have two

500
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,559
hexadecimal characters that make up one

501
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,600
hexadecimal value so every value in hex

502
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,559
is always two characters side by side

503
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,919
and we tend to write them as 0x

504
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,559
and then the two characters so if i say

505
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,600
9a in hex it will be

506
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,760
0x9a and we write it that way to make

507
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,280
sure we can differentiate between

508
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
hexadecimal and decimal because if i was

509
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
just writing 1 2

510
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,760
we don't know if that's 12 in decimal or

511
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
1 2 in hexadecimal so by putting 0x at

512
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,960
the beginning we know that is a

513
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,679
hexadecimal value

514
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,280
with that in mind

515
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,919
this is how we we read data and this is

516
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,880
how we look at a byte of data and we get

517
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,039
to the hexadecimal value

518
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,360
so just to walk you through this we

519
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
start out with a byte we have zero zero

520
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,240
one zero one zero 1 1 at the top of this

521
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,679
slide

522
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
we split that out into two nibbles so

523
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,679
just put a bigger gap in between the two

524
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,960
nibbles

525
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,440
because we know each four

526
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
byte

527
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
value is going to be one hex small

528
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
character so we calculate those two

529
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
separately

530
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
we then come up with our multipliers so

531
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,880
in in uh

532
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,280
in binary we have 2 to the power of 0 2

533
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,520
to the power 1 2 by 2 2 to the power 3.

534
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
so our multipliers here the one two four

535
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,000
eight going from the right hand side

536
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,679
just as we did with with decimal

537
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,840
numbering when we broke that number down

538
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
we add those multipliers here but this

539
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,559
time it's two to the power so one times

540
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,160
two to the power zero is is one one

541
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,720
times two to the power one is two

542
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
zero times two to the power of three is

543
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,640
zero because it's always zero when you

544
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,360
multiply by zero um and then one times

545
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,720
two to the power

546
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
three

547
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
uh is eight

548
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,159
so we add eight two and one and we get

549
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,200
eleven

550
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,280
and remember that i said we get naught

551
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
to nine and then we have to start

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
counting instead of going 10 11 12 we go

553
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,559
a b c so 11 is the letter b

554
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,320
so on the right hand side we have a b we

555
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
do the same on the left hand side you

556
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
can see we have no ones we have one two

557
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,280
no fours and no eights so it's two on

558
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,440
the left hand side so we bring those two

559
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
together at that point and we would

560
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,840
write this hex decimal value as zero x

561
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
to b

562
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,440
and and that's the way that hex decimal

563
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,679
works

564
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
above our bits and bytes so that's

565
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,440
that's our lowest level of the data

566
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
as we understand it above that we then

567
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,919
have sectors and clusters

568
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,159
bytes of data are grouped together

569
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,159
intersectors and clusters

570
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,360
a sector is typically 512 bytes

571
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
at this point in time that's the the

572
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
most common value you will come across

573
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
however that is not guaranteed

574
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,760
it's set by the device manufacturer

575
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
and it is written into the file system

576
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,799
header so you can see that value and and

577
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,480
verify it is 512 bytes but at the moment

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,039
most of them are are set uh as a default

579
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,120
to 512 bytes

580
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,159
in the future it's likely to become 4096

581
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,159
it will be the common value

582
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,080
so as i say don't always assume it's

583
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,480
necessarily 512 but at the moment that's

584
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
probably the the one you're most likely

585
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,480
to come across in an investigation

586
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,840
so each 512 bytes is grouped together

587
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,679
and that's called a sector

588
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,240
and then you have eight sectors is a

589
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
cluster

590
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
a cluster is the smallest amount of

591
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,960
space that the operating system can see

592
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
and write to

593
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
so you create a file on a system

594
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
if the file is less than 4096 bytes

595
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
which is eight sectors then it will be

596
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,200
written into one cluster

597
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,919
once a file occupies a cluster

598
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,600
no other space in that cluster can be

599
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
used that entire cluster is used by that

600
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
file whether the data fills it or not

601
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
the operating system allocates that

602
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,760
cluster

603
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,400
so that is the the smallest space that

604
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,760
the system can can see and can use

605
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,919
each individual cluster

606
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,400
is labeled by the operating system as

607
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
either allocated or unallocated

608
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
allocated simply means a file is in it

609
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,360
it's allocated to a file so no other

610
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,360
file can use it

611
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,080
unallocated simply means it's not

612
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,480
currently allocated to any files on that

613
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,120
system so it's available to be used and

614
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,159
that's all those two terms mean

615
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,039
it's important to note however

616
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
if a cluster is unallocated now

617
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,679
that does not mean it was never

618
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,000
allocated to a file

619
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,679
you may have deleted files existing

620
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,559
within an allocated clusters so this is

621
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,919
what we mean when we talk about an

622
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,760
allocated space

623
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,159
it's areas of the disk that may contain

624
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
deleted data that might be relevant to

625
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,200
our investigation

626
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
you also have something called slack

627
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,240
space

628
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,760
i mentioned if a file is smaller than a

629
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
cluster size it will be written to one

630
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
cluster but it won't occupy the entirety

631
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,679
of that cluster

632
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,080
the space left over is what we call

633
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,639
slack space

634
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
and this is actually if we draw it out

635
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
there's actually a few different types

636
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,679
of slack space

637
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
you can see here you have an entire

638
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,559
cluster which i've broken down here into

639
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,640
eight different sectors so you can see

640
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
each of these

641
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,440
uh light markers is a sector boundary

642
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,640
the file

643
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,919
only occupies this amount of space

644
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
so you have

645
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,120
five and a

646
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
third ish

647
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
sectors occupied by actual file content

648
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,520
you then have all of this bit so two and

649
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,760
two-thirds-ish sectors

650
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
completely unused and

651
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,919
nothing can use that space because it's

652
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
allocated to this one particular file

653
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,559
now

654
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,880
when this file is written the operating

655
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,559
system does slightly different things

656
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,200
with these two bits of slack space

657
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,760
you have this area here which is the end

658
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,159
of the file's actual content

659
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
to the end of that sector so this is one

660
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
sector here

661
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
this bit contains content and this bit

662
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,159
doesn't but this is all still one sector

663
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,919
this bit in here is what we call ram

664
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,880
slack

665
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
has nothing to do with ram um it's a

666
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,960
historical name um this is zeroed when

667
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,520
you write a file the rest of that sector

668
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,679
is zeroed

669
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,400
the two sectors at the end here that

670
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,720
aren't used by the file

671
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,320
completely unused sectors at the end of

672
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
the cluster they are just left alone so

673
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,080
if they previously contained any data

674
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,080
when this file is written that data will

675
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
still be there nothing else is is going

676
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,640
to use that space nothing else is

677
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
written there it's not zeroed it's just

678
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
left alone so those it's all slack space

679
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
at the end of the file but it's two

680
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,360
different types of slack ram slack is

681
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,600
zeroed file slack which is what we call

682
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,159
the unused sectors it isn't so there may

683
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,000
be deleted content in there as well that

684
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
is of interest to us there's actually a

685
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,960
third type of slack which i will mention

686
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,520
and this is the unused space potentially

687
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,440
that may exist at the end of a file

688
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,640
system

689
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
this is typically going to be

690
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,799
smaller than the size of a cluster it's

691
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,720
typically very small

692
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
unless

693
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
hypothetically or it is technically

694
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,720
possible for somebody to

695
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
to create space at the end maybe they

696
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,120
want to hide some data maybe a malicious

697
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,200
attacker has deliberately created some

698
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
volume slack to hide something

699
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
i've not seen that in the real world but

700
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,559
it is possible and so there may be that

701
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,640
that case where that happens but for the

702
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
most part it will be a tiny amount and

703
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,000
it purely exists because the

704
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,279
partition

705
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
is not an exact uh

706
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,919
multiple of of clusters so there's a bit

707
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,919
of space left over at the end where it

708
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,520
wasn't able to allocate an entire

709
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,919
cluster for the operating system to use

710
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,640
so it's just dead space basically

711
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
it may contain deleted data potentially

712
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
uh in most cases i've come across it it

713
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,159
doesn't exist or it doesn't contain

714
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,480
useful data but it's you need to know

715
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,200
about it and you can check for it if you

716
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
you have a case where you think it maybe

717
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,799
may exist or may be used

718
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
and to illustrate

719
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,240
why we might want to look in in slack

720
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,159
space this is what happens when a file

721
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,520
is deleted

722
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
i have a text file you can see there's

723
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
information that is highly relevant to

724
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,880
my particular investigation in here

725
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,240
my latin is now non-existent i did study

726
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,880
latin i don't remember any of it

727
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,039
but let's let's say this is relevant to

728
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,679
our particular investigation

729
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,600
somebody overwrites that file they've

730
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,919
deleted it and they've decided to

731
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,400
overwrite it with baby shark because

732
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
baby shark was of more interest to them

733
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,840
and what's happened here is this second

734
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,799
file this image file is smaller than the

735
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,039
original text file

736
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
it's been written into the same space

737
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
but you then have this ram slack

738
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,200
which is that space between the end of

739
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
the file's content and the end of that

740
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,159
cluster so this is zeroed out you can

741
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
see it's blank

742
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
but then you can see there are two

743
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,600
sectors at the bottom here

744
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
that still contain

745
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
part of our text file and because that

746
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
is a text file we can read it we can

747
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
still see the contents of that

748
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,360
particular file

749
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,960
if it was a zip file for example

750
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,640
the data would still be there but it's

751
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,720
compressed and we don't have the header

752
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,799
anymore so we may not be able we most

753
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,480
likely can't recover that data at that

754
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,159
point in time but because this is a

755
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,039
plain text file we can recover that data

756
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,200
so we could see that is still relevant

757
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,799
to our investigation and we're going to

758
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,840
want to go and have a look at

759
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,720
it so that data there is our file slack

760
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
and that's what we're going to to look

761
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
at in our investigation

762
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
and it's really easy to recover deleted

763
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,360
files if they're still intact so the

764
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,679
previous example it had been overwritten

765
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,440
but if it hadn't been

766
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,679
how do we recover that data well the

767
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,799
answer is

768
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,679
quite easy if it hasn't been overwritten

769
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,080
all of that complete file still exists

770
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,240
on the system along with all of that

771
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,559
metadata the embedded metadata because

772
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,000
it's within the file and the file is

773
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,039
intact but also the file system metadata

774
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,679
in this particular example we can see

775
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,320
this is a file named cruise ship.jpeg

776
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,640
that file name is in file system

777
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
metadata so that hasn't been overwritten

778
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,919
it's still there and in this case we can

779
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,480
use a tool in this case i've used ftk

780
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
imager which is just one of the tools

781
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
you can use and we can we can literally

782
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
just right click and export the file and

783
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,919
have a look at it in any way we want

784
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,360
so really easy to recover intact files

785
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,039
and that middle layer

786
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,000
in our pyramid was file systems

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,679
i briefly mentioned file systems but

788
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,679
what do i mean

789
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
think of a file system as

790
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,919
the digital equivalent of a filing

791
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,480
cabinet you have a filing cabinet that

792
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,760
can contain files it can contain folders

793
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,840
you can have files within folders you

794
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,240
can have folders within folders you can

795
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
have files loose in there it's just a

796
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,279
structure for you to be able to store

797
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
files and folders and that's all i mean

798
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,000
by a file system

799
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,520
there are different types of file

800
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
systems that you may come across windows

801
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
by default at the moment is installed on

802
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,840
ntfs which is the new technology file

803
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
system that has been the case for many

804
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,919
many years so if you ever look at a

805
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,520
windows system you are likely to come

806
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,279
across ntfs

807
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,399
you can also format usbs with ntfs if

808
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,399
you so wish it's not the default option

809
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,600
but you can

810
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,559
the default option will likely be fat32

811
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,200
if it's a thumb drive or exfat if it's

812
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,279
an external usb

813
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,279
so those you were likely to come across

814
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,399
fat32 was the old default for windows so

815
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,399
if you come across

816
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
probably windows server 2000 or

817
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,600
something like that some windows xp

818
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,399
maybe although that's when ntfs came in

819
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
you may come across fat32

820
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,480
you may come across expat if somebody

821
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
has chosen to format the file system in

822
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,200
that way

823
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,360
so they're the main ones for windows mac

824
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,960
os at the newer max will be apfs so

825
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,919
apple file system older max will be hfs

826
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,960
plus

827
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
if you're on linux it will be ext4

828
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,640
probably the default used to be ext3

829
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,440
there used to be ext2 there's a pattern

830
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,880
uh these these are just some of the

831
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
common ones that you may come across

832
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,840
and

833
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
it's just different

834
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,960
different filing cabinets different

835
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,559
instructions for how the operating

836
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,640
system should be storing files and

837
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,960
folders and as i mentioned for each of

838
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,440
these different file systems the file

839
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,000
system metadata that is stored so

840
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,799
the type and the amount of file system

841
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,760
metadata will differ slightly between

842
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,960
those for example ntfs stores way more

843
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,919
time stamps in file system metadata than

844
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,799
fat32 so just just one example where

845
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,679
those things differ

846
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,159
and now that we've talked about what we

847
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,799
mean by digital evidence where do we

848
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,200
find it where can we actually get hold

849
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
of that digital evidence that is

850
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,760
relevant to do our investigation

851
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,480
the answer is pretty much everywhere um

852
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,880
any electronic device is is the short

853
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,200
answer to that this is a non-exhaustive

854
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,080
list but just things that think about

855
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,080
what you have around the home you have

856
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,360
desktop computers laptop computers

857
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,919
you'll have tablets mobile devices

858
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,080
usbs removable media

859
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,320
you might have internet of things

860
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,679
devices

861
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,559
you might have a google home uh amazon

862
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,000
alexa

863
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,320
cameras a ring doorbell

864
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,799
all sorts of of things around the home

865
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,960
you may have drones i've yet to play

866
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
with a drone but i need to add that to

867
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,279
my my to-do list for fun

868
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,080
vehicles if you have a car then that's

869
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,279
basically

870
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,760
a massive of moving computers there's

871
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,559
your head unit but there's also

872
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,240
electronic devices that control

873
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,039
everything the lights the doors

874
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,360
uh the the signals

875
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,559
the brakes

876
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,720
everything is is controlled by a

877
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,200
computer on a vehicle so pretty much

878
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
everywhere there's there's data all over

879
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,919
uh networks if you have a network set up

880
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,200
the cloud everything we do now and

881
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,840
increasingly so as we go along

882
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,000
data is stored in the cloud

883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
so we we also have to go and look there

884
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,159
uh to go and grab the data that may be

885
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,799
relevant to our particular investigation

886
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,000
that is digital evidence

887
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
moving on to

888
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,679
digital investigation and and what that

889
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
means

890
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,679
what do i mean by digital investigation

891
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,200
it's simply a process that we go through

892
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,399
to ask questions about what happened and

893
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,120
try and find answers to that

894
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
we need to try and work out

895
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,880
what the series of digital events were

896
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,840
that happened on that particular system

897
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,519
and we do that by following a process of

898
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,600
identifying what may be

899
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,240
of interest acquiring our data

900
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,799
processing and interpreting our data

901
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,240
analyzing it

902
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,720
to determine those events and write a

903
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,519
report based on the findings that we

904
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,799
come across

905
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,080
all of which is relevant to the

906
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,079
investigation we ignore things that

907
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,599
aren't relevant to that particular

908
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,199
investigation

909
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,079
and

910
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,719
we say this should be done by someone

911
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,359
who has had some sort of training

912
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,119
to do this

913
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,000
and we say this because if you

914
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
are acquiring data

915
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,800
if you are interpreting data

916
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,960
and reporting on it to

917
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,839
tell your your client or stand up in a

918
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,320
court of law and explain what happened

919
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,560
you need to do that correctly and it's

920
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,879
it's very easy to get it to get it wrong

921
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,119
if you don't acquire data in the right

922
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,918
way you can change the data you can

923
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,839
erase data

924
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,040
quite easily by by doing something in

925
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,440
the wrong way so that's why we say it's

926
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,679
it's important to know what you're doing

927
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,000
in order to conduct an investigation in

928
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,480
this way

929
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
and an investigation

930
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,280
as i said asks questions

931
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
it tries to find answers to those

932
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,160
questions we're looking for the what why

933
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
when where how

934
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,560
i may have missed one out what when why

935
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
where yeah how all the questions as to

936
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,520
what happened on that system

937
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,280
as we start to try and answer those

938
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,040
questions we will probably come up with

939
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,800
more questions that's the way

940
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
investigation works

941
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,680
you have lines of inquiry you dig in to

942
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,560
that line of inquiry and

943
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,720
potentially get to the end or

944
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,960
come to some sort of evidence that that

945
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,040
proves it or disproves it you work your

946
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,720
way back and you go down another line of

947
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,040
inquiry it's this

948
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
kind of

949
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
dance almost of uh looking at the

950
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,480
evidence and working out exactly what

951
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,560
happened and making sure you get the

952
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,200
facts in that particular case

953
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
you will have lots of stakeholders most

954
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,640
likely or you have at least one

955
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,400
stakeholder right somebody's asked you

956
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
to do the investigation it may be

957
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,880
clients it may be

958
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
in a legal setting you may have

959
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,200
attorneys it may be human resources if

960
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,880
it's an internal case

961
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,800
it can be a mixture of all of these

962
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
things

963
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,480
so lots of different angles

964
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,400
that we come from

965
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
and there are lots of different types of

966
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,200
case

967
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,040
these are just some of the

968
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,640
investigations that you might come

969
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,280
across it is by no means an exhaustive

970
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,240
list

971
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,680
but just to walk through what some of

972
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,119
these are

973
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,440
instant response and threat hunting

974
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,560
are basically two sides of the same coin

975
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
incident response is where you receive

976
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,280
an alert something has happened on a

977
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
system on a network and you need to

978
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,560
respond to that so this is a reactive

979
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,079
process

980
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,240
you get the notification

981
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,079
you go and investigate it may be

982
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
something like

983
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:52,640
an intrusion it may be phishing it may

984
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,359
be

985
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,079
malware and attackers in the system or

986
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,720
unauthorized access denial of service

987
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
all of these things

988
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,839
you will likely have someone monitoring

989
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,000
your networks they get an alert you go

990
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,599
and investigate

991
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,119
threat hunting

992
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
is assuming that a breach has occurred

993
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
but without having evidence of it

994
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,839
and actively going off and looking

995
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,560
hunting for evidence of that particular

996
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,520
breach

997
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,920
this is all about understanding what

998
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,760
looks normal on your network and on your

999
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,119
systems

1000
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,960
having threat intelligence having

1001
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,280
indicators of compromise

1002
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,720
information about known attacks

1003
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
that you can go off and search for you

1004
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,720
can use those indicators and go and

1005
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,720
search your network and try and find

1006
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
evidence that some sort of incident has

1007
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
occurred but that you haven't received

1008
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,119
an alert for so this is this is a

1009
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,040
similar kind of process but it's

1010
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
proactive you're actively hunting for

1011
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,240
something that's happened

1012
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,720
we then have domex documented media

1013
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,160
exploitation

1014
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,680
this is all about intelligence and less

1015
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,520
about the

1016
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,000
strict process of evidence and best

1017
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
practice around evidence

1018
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,160
you have severe time pressures it may be

1019
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,240
something like a child has been

1020
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,359
kidnapped you only have a very short

1021
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,480
window to be able to get to the data as

1022
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,599
quickly as possible analyze it and find

1023
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
something useful to be able to act on it

1024
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,040
to go in and find that child before it's

1025
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,520
too late it's that sort of case

1026
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,240
so heavy time pressures and much more

1027
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
about the intelligence than it is about

1028
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
following process getting all of the

1029
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,119
data and doing a thorough investigation

1030
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,839
it's very targeted and it's it's really

1031
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,799
high time pressure

1032
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,640
uh you have other military action so

1033
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
domex can be a military environment uh

1034
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,839
the example i gave was was it was child

1035
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,599
kidnapped but it could be

1036
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,640
that you have uh you're in the field in

1037
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,240
a battle and you need to get that

1038
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,640
intelligence quickly to be able to

1039
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,520
determine what your troops next action

1040
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,680
needs to be so that can be

1041
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,760
a military focus as well but then you

1042
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,160
can have other military-based action and

1043
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,040
this is where there's less of a time

1044
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,280
less of a heavy time pressure

1045
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
you still need to get to the information

1046
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,800
quickly it's still all about

1047
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
intelligence

1048
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,240
but it's not

1049
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
quite as heavily focused on on time

1050
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,320
pressure you don't have that missing

1051
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
child

1052
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,040
but you do need to make sure that your

1053
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,000
troops are heading in the right

1054
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
direction so it's not an immediate

1055
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,960
need

1056
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
but it is still a focus on triage and

1057
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,400
it's still a focus on grabbing that

1058
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,320
intelligence and acting upon it while

1059
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
you still can

1060
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,960
we then have auditing and

1061
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,920
this is where we are

1062
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,000
using an investigation

1063
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,359
to

1064
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,480
assure

1065
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
that companies are following

1066
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,960
the processes that they should be

1067
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,480
following they're following standards

1068
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
they should be should be following

1069
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
uh and they are

1070
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,040
doing their their work in the right way

1071
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,720
they're following the

1072
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,200
standards that they claim to be

1073
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,880
complying with

1074
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,480
it's all about providing that assurance

1075
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,720
around all of those things around

1076
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,800
processes and systems in in an

1077
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,960
organization

1078
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,560
regulatory investigations so regulators

1079
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,680
are

1080
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
empowered by law

1081
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,839
to be able to investigate organizations

1082
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,760
to make sure they are behaving in the

1083
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,200
right way and to protect consumers

1084
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
and if

1085
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
they are if they need investigating so

1086
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,280
somebody maybe makes a complaint to a

1087
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
regulator about an organization they can

1088
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,000
then launch an investigation and go and

1089
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,520
do a formal inquiry into that particular

1090
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
set of circumstances

1091
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
so all the same processes in terms of

1092
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,079
doing the investigation but it has a

1093
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,599
focus on

1094
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,800
what should that company be doing and

1095
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,839
have they

1096
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,119
have they followed the correct

1097
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,359
procedures and and all of those things

1098
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,839
it can be things like insider trading

1099
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:06,000
fraud

1100
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,920
negligence or all of those types of

1101
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,960
things

1102
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,720
and there are loads of regulatory bodies

1103
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,200
worldwide these are just some of them on

1104
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,880
this particular slide but there are

1105
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,240
loads of them in various different

1106
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,760
countries that do these types of

1107
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,599
investigations

1108
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,680
you can have internal investigations

1109
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,880
this is mostly what i do day in day out

1110
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
looking working with hr

1111
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,560
and looking at things like

1112
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,880
acceptable use policies in organizations

1113
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,599
and are employees complying with that or

1114
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,040
are they looking at websites they

1115
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,640
shouldn't be looking at are they

1116
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,880
stealing information are they connecting

1117
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
devices they shouldn't be connecting to

1118
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
particular systems depending on what the

1119
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,920
the policy dictates for that particular

1120
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,440
system

1121
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,760
these are generally not legal cases

1122
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,800
they're not criminal acts they could be

1123
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
you could have an example where an

1124
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,680
employee is looking at illegal material

1125
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,720
online it does happen uh

1126
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
why people do things at work i have no

1127
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
idea

1128
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,599
but it can it can happen and it does

1129
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,280
happen so it can become a criminal

1130
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
investigation

1131
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,119
and for that any investigation can

1132
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,960
become a criminal investigation and for

1133
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
that reason we say always always always

1134
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,319
follow the correct procedures for

1135
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,920
dealing with evidence

1136
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,560
however these are just one example where

1137
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,480
it's not expected they would become

1138
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
criminal from the word go but we follow

1139
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,640
those processes anyway

1140
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,960
and then you do have criminal and civil

1141
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,480
litigation so legal cases

1142
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,560
and it will be either criminal law or

1143
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,119
civil law criminal law deals with an

1144
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,280
offense against the state

1145
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,440
so this is where it may be an individual

1146
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
it may be an organization but basically

1147
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,400
a law has been broken

1148
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,280
civil law deals with

1149
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,920
an injury to an individual or an

1150
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,200
organization

1151
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,520
this is likely to be something like

1152
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,240
somebody claiming compensation for

1153
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,760
an injury walking down the street

1154
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
because the path was broken or something

1155
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
along those lines

1156
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,800
with

1157
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,119
all of these uh any

1158
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,640
any offense so anything any criminal

1159
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,599
acts can involve digital devices

1160
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,000
we tend to think lots of people tend to

1161
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,800
think oh i know i've got a criminal case

1162
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,720
and it involves digital forensics so it

1163
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,480
must be cyber crime cyber warfare um

1164
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,040
it could be but actually

1165
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,200
every single crime can have a digital

1166
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,760
element to it if you think about

1167
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,400
somebody commits a homicide

1168
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,319
maybe they were carrying a smartphone

1169
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,680
maybe the victim was carrying a

1170
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,560
smartphone maybe they did it in a place

1171
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,720
where there was lots of cctv

1172
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,880
maybe there were

1173
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,640
internet of things devices maybe there

1174
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,520
was a video doorbell maybe

1175
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
there was a google home that recorded

1176
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,839
everything that was said

1177
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,440
all of these things

1178
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,119
are their digital evidence they are

1179
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,240
things that we can use in that

1180
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
particular investigation

1181
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
so yeah just because it's not a

1182
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,960
cyber crime type thing it doesn't mean

1183
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,599
it it won't include digital devices

1184
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,640
and with all of these things we

1185
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,319
need to deal with the courts we we have

1186
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,400
to go through the courts and we have to

1187
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,480
make sure we preserve the evidence

1188
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,720
properly we do all of our documentation

1189
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,960
properly to be able to present that to

1190
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,319
the court

1191
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,119
and do it in a way that they will accept

1192
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,599
our evidence and our findings when we

1193
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,079
when we report when we testify

1194
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,560
the difference between criminal and

1195
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,040
civil criminal litigation you have to

1196
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,599
prove the case beyond reasonable doubt

1197
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,599
civil litigation is a balance of

1198
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,240
probabilities so one side of the

1199
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,880
argument simply has to prove the case

1200
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
better than the other side of the the

1201
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,200
argument so that's

1202
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,960
less for us to worry about as digital

1203
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,480
forensic analysts but it's good to be

1204
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,839
aware of how these things work

1205
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,880
for when we go and testify if we need to

1206
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,720
we also from a digital forensic

1207
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,240
perspective we might need to deal with

1208
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,359
some constraints with civil litigation

1209
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,359
which are incredibly frustrating but we

1210
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,720
need to be aware of them there may be

1211
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
things like privileged data if i go and

1212
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,800
talk to my lawyer that data is

1213
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,200
privileged and it may be that that data

1214
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,839
is excluded from any investigation of my

1215
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,599
particular device

1216
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,319
so

1217
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,079
something to be aware of there may be

1218
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,960
data we cannot acquire there may be data

1219
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,079
we cannot analyze and we just need to

1220
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,640
accept that's the way it is and any

1221
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,800
findings we come across are based on

1222
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,040
what we could analyze what we could

1223
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,160
acquire and we just ignore everything

1224
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,279
else that we couldn't look at

1225
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,119
summary

1226
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,119
lots of different types of investigation

1227
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,200
the process that we follow the

1228
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
documentation that we produce is the

1229
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,280
same for all of them we still need to

1230
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,200
follow best practice advice in the

1231
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,319
industry

1232
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,280
we need to make sure our evidence is

1233
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
is

1234
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,119
preserved properly collected properly

1235
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,440
all of our documentation is put together

1236
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,599
the difference between these is more

1237
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,359
around which questions we're asking so

1238
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,680
that who what why when where how

1239
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,280
different types of questions different

1240
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,200
angle different artifacts we're going to

1241
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,680
be looking at but the process and and

1242
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,280
all of those skills

1243
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,960
are the same in all these different

1244
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,839
types of investigation

1245
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
moving on to what is digital forensics

1246
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,599
which is

1247
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,200
why you're all here

1248
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,160
really

1249
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,280
so

1250
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,040
i needed to talk about digital evidence

1251
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,119
and investigation before actually

1252
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,720
talking about digital forensics as a

1253
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,839
whole and digital forensics is just

1254
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,760
bringing all of that together it's the

1255
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,200
process of how do we identify

1256
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,640
which evidence is relevant in our case

1257
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,200
how do we acquire it how do we properly

1258
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,520
preserve it and store it we need to make

1259
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,160
sure that evidence is not changed in any

1260
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,560
in any way if we possibly can it's

1261
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,839
preserved

1262
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,599
as we go through the case so that we are

1263
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,720
analyzing the actual data we need to

1264
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,720
interpret that data properly we need to

1265
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,880
report on that data and present on that

1266
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,359
data potentially in a way that it will

1267
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,880
always in a way that is legally

1268
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,880
acceptable because potentially we're

1269
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,400
going to go to court

1270
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
even if we don't it still needs to

1271
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,599
maintain

1272
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:30,240
that that legal acceptability we still

1273
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,079
need to present to clients to

1274
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,880
stakeholders to hr to

1275
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,599
whoever our stakeholders are

1276
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,280
and therefore we still need to maintain

1277
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,800
those standards

1278
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,640
and the way that we do this is that we

1279
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,119
use best practice we use scientifically

1280
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,680
derived and proven methods best practice

1281
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,079
in the industry to do all of these

1282
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,119
things

1283
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,760
and in that way we maintain consistency

1284
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,920
we make sure that we do things in the

1285
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,559
right way and in an acceptable way

1286
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,680
so that

1287
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,559
everyone is is on the same page and they

1288
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,920
can have confidence that we've we've

1289
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,559
done our job properly

1290
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,920
in doing this we

1291
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,160
need to understand

1292
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,079
what our digital evidence is how to

1293
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,160
interpret that data

1294
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,640
when artifacts are created what

1295
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,640
circumstances lead to particular

1296
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,119
artifacts being created

1297
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,720
so therefore what our digital evidence

1298
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,040
can show us we need to be

1299
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,440
working out what the facts are of that

1300
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,240
particular case because it's our job to

1301
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,240
present on the facts that that's all our

1302
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,200
job is is to work out what the actual

1303
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,319
events were that occurred on that system

1304
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,400
how that digital evidence was created

1305
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,520
and used what actions a user performed

1306
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,040
on that system

1307
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,280
and that's what we're presenting

1308
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,960
that's our job to to put all that

1309
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,359
together

1310
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,839
we need to

1311
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,680
to do that properly we need to

1312
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,760
understand a little bit about the

1313
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,079
history of digital forensics

1314
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,079
how did we get to where we are now

1315
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,200
because

1316
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,839
it took a while uh we

1317
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,400
we are now in a really good place where

1318
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,040
we have really well established

1319
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,079
processes guidelines best practice we

1320
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,800
have an incredible community of digital

1321
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,480
forensic practitioners

1322
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,119
a lot of whom spend a lot of their own

1323
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,200
time doing research and development

1324
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,240
producing amazing tools that are really

1325
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,000
useful for the rest of us

1326
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,040
things like examine suite of tools

1327
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,839
things like uh sarah edwards apollo

1328
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:40,640
things like alexis brignonis i leap

1329
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,960
all of these things have a look on this

1330
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,079
sans.org free a bunch of free tools that

1331
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,880
a lot of the community have developed

1332
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,280
and they're amazing and we have all of

1333
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,920
that because we've we've kind of gone

1334
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,520
through this progression through the the

1335
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,720
decades

1336
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,119
starting from from nowhere basically so

1337
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,839
digital forensics back in the 80s wasn't

1338
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,119
a thing

1339
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,720
it didn't really exist back in the 80s

1340
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,040
we just really started to get personal

1341
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,480
computers

1342
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,800
they were very expensive they were

1343
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,599
really only owned by hobbyists by

1344
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,599
universities primarily

1345
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,119
by businesses

1346
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,720
people who had

1347
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,760
enough money to be able to acquire these

1348
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,760
these bricks as they were because they

1349
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,640
were

1350
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,319
massive things

1351
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,520
and

1352
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,000
generally i mean there was no

1353
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,280
concept of crime on a computer

1354
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,160
and

1355
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,640
the the incidents that happened were

1356
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,280
generally just in terms of cost how much

1357
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,920
does it cost to fix this thing

1358
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
if you haven't read the cuckoo's egg

1359
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
this this book by clifford stahl i would

1360
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,280
highly recommend it it's a very good

1361
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,599
read about how in in the 80s i think it

1362
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,400
was 1986 or 87

1363
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,240
he basically came across a minimal

1364
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,839
accounting error

1365
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:00,960
and

1366
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,760
in order to try and or in the process of

1367
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,960
trying to work out what actually

1368
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,079
happened

1369
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,720
he detected an attacker in the system

1370
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,720
and it's all about that journey of going

1371
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,760
through identifying this this one tiny

1372
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,920
accounting error that most people may

1373
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,119
have missed

1374
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,800
and picked away at that thread and

1375
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,920
pulled and pulled and pulled and

1376
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,520
eventually found an attacker in the

1377
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,599
network so it's a very good read i

1378
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,760
highly recommend that book to anyone and

1379
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,960
everyone if you haven't read it already

1380
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,559
moving forward 10 years to the 90s

1381
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,160
this is when

1382
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,480
computers were in ever in well a lot of

1383
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,920
homes not every home but more and more

1384
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,880
people

1385
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,520
bought computers at this point in time

1386
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,000
this is i had a computer in the 90s i

1387
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,280
got the internet in 1996 i believe it

1388
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,559
was

1389
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,240
aol of course because everyone had aol

1390
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,240
uh online with the

1391
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,119
um

1392
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,640
you got mail

1393
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,000
yeah uh that probably wasn't a good

1394
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,640
impression anyway everyone had aol and

1395
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,960
the dial up modem which i can still

1396
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,559
remember the

1397
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,880
weird wizzy sound that dialup makes when

1398
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,960
you connect to aol

1399
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,520
uh you you set it off you walk away you

1400
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,440
go grab a drink and you come back in and

1401
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,040
and hopefully it's connected by that

1402
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,280
point in time i don't really miss those

1403
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,160
days um but this is where we had more

1404
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,839
people with computers

1405
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,839
homes were connected at this point in

1406
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,720
time

1407
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,280
you had things like netscape and you

1408
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,200
started to have browsers to to go and

1409
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
access the internet

1410
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,480
and

1411
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,119
you could go and do lots of instant

1412
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,040
messaging with random strangers that was

1413
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,680
the great thing about aol back then

1414
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,760
we had storage media we had lots of

1415
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,079
floppy disks at this point in time

1416
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,280
uh i yeah remember floppy disks not so

1417
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,520
much the the actual floppy ones the the

1418
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,200
larger five and a quarter it was more

1419
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,720
than the three and a half inch ones that

1420
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,559
are in this picture here

1421
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,520
we started to get um standards as well

1422
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,440
so this is where digital forensics

1423
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,400
really did start to develop as a field

1424
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,480
and this is where we have the the acpo

1425
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,920
guidelines which i'll talk about so

1426
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,839
these were the first

1427
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,599
best practice guidelines that were

1428
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,000
produced on how to deal with digital

1429
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,960
evidence digital evidence was recognized

1430
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,720
at this point in time the police had

1431
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,200
started to have to deal with with crimes

1432
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,200
being committed on computers so

1433
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,640
guidelines were put together to try and

1434
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,319
tell people the best way of dealing with

1435
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,839
these things this is where standards

1436
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,000
started to come into play and after we

1437
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,440
had the akpo guidelines that's the

1438
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,000
association of chief police officers and

1439
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,880
we started to then have swgde then

1440
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
picked up on that and brought out some

1441
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,480
standards and they now have loads of

1442
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,480
standards

1443
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,599
2000s we then got windows xp yay which

1444
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,920
was the best operating system for many

1445
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,160
years until it was discontinued

1446
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,640
we got search engines we got google this

1447
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,599
is where the internet became really

1448
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,480
searchable and really useful to people

1449
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,640
we got the first smartphones we got the

1450
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,559
first iphone and then of course as soon

1451
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,319
as we got the first iphone we got the

1452
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,960
first android smartphone not long

1453
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,200
afterwards and this is where mobile

1454
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,920
phone usage really took off because you

1455
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,160
had a portable computer in your pocket

1456
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,400
at this point in time

1457
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,240
this is a decade where we started to get

1458
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,319
training and

1459
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,480
research and and workshops and

1460
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,800
conferences and and more and more

1461
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,000
collaboration in the community the first

1462
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,599
iterations of of sans for 408 and 508

1463
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,839
came out in this decade we had dfr ws i

1464
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:39,359
always get those wrong way around a

1465
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,680
digital forensic research workshop which

1466
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,599
is where the community started talking

1467
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,359
about research and development that they

1468
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,119
were doing in the field of digital

1469
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,760
forensics so this is where things really

1470
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,599
took off with with training and all of

1471
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,000
those awesome things that we kind of

1472
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,160
take for granted now

1473
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,760
2010s

1474
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,400
is where we kind of saw

1475
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,640
evolution really in terms of electronic

1476
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,000
devices

1477
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,760
more data stored in the cloud more

1478
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,400
storage available on devices more

1479
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,280
internet of things more connectivity

1480
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,160
constant updates there are millions and

1481
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,799
millions of applications for android for

1482
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,040
ios for windows

1483
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
for blackberry for windows phone if you

1484
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
want to go back to this kind of this

1485
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,720
kind of time

1486
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,240
so many systems so many applications we

1487
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,319
started to see encryption

1488
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,400
we started to see things like snapchat

1489
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,119
where

1490
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,400
you can delete chats we now have of

1491
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,079
course lots of applications that do that

1492
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,559
things like signal whatsapp now has uh

1493
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,960
chats that automatically disappear

1494
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,119
all of those things started to become a

1495
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,440
thing and are now much more prevalent um

1496
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,799
these days

1497
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,119
we started to see lots of data breaches

1498
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,520
as well in this decade

1499
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
and we did get a bit of breach fatigue i

1500
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,640
think

1501
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,680
i mean i i get notifications

1502
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,599
fairly regularly saying

1503
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,240
this linkedin's been hacked

1504
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,000
this this other website's been hacked

1505
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,079
your data's been leaked and

1506
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,240
the more notifications that

1507
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,680
users get about these types of breaches

1508
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,200
you do kind of just think oh that's

1509
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,520
happened again fine let's just file away

1510
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,359
this email and

1511
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,160
yeah

1512
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,319
my information's already out there and

1513
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,079
so we kind of got a lot of these in in

1514
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,520
this decade

1515
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,640
and we still to be fair get a lot now

1516
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,960
all of these things these developments

1517
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,520
have led to a few challenges and

1518
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,359
we still have these challenges today

1519
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,520
getting around encryption for example if

1520
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,520
you're trying to acquire a device you

1521
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,280
don't have the password it's encrypted

1522
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,640
it's turned off

1523
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,720
we have issues these are all challenges

1524
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,559
that we need to to try and get around so

1525
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,559
this is where those challenges really

1526
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,839
started

1527
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,319
and they're only only evolving

1528
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,559
um as we go through

1529
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,480
so now what

1530
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,720
now what happens uh this is kind of

1531
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,480
where i often throw it out to the to the

1532
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,040
floor what what does everyone predict

1533
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,760
from from 2020 and beyond

1534
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,160
throw your ideas in slack and let let me

1535
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,559
know what you think

1536
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,119
the pandemic's been an interesting one i

1537
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,920
think in many ways it's accelerated a

1538
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,839
lot of changes that may have happened

1539
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,839
anyway but but more slowly

1540
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,000
things like there's now a lot more

1541
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,599
remote working so remote working

1542
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,559
capability has taken a big leap forward

1543
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,480
if you think about zoom

1544
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,599
everyone

1545
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,240
we're on zoom now everyone suddenly

1546
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,799
decided to get zoom in in march last

1547
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,760
year

1548
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,079
it became the application to use for

1549
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,520
video calling

1550
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,160
whereas beforehand i think it was a

1551
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,559
small minority who'd even heard i had i

1552
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,559
hadn't heard of the application um

1553
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,720
before march 2020 and then all of a

1554
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,640
sudden everyone was using it including

1555
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,960
our prime minister in the uk for the

1556
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,680
daily covert briefs so there you go it

1557
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,240
was catapulted into the limelight

1558
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,640
as a consequence it's had a lot of

1559
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,119
updates since that point in time

1560
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,799
it's become much more secure because

1561
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,680
originally it wasn't too secure

1562
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,760
because they hadn't had that opportunity

1563
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
really it was still quite new and they

1564
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,640
hadn't had so many thousands of users on

1565
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,440
it so that's just one example where i

1566
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,760
think the pandemic has accelerated

1567
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,599
technological development

1568
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,640
and i think

1569
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
hopefully hopefully that's a good thing

1570
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,319
that will come out of all of this

1571
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,559
hopefully that will continue and we will

1572
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,480
see some of those those really cool

1573
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,200
things coming out in the years ahead

1574
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,680
we we shall see watch this space i think

1575
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,760
so why do we do digital forensics what's

1576
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,480
the

1577
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
what's the purpose of it

1578
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,160
just to work out what happened that

1579
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,960
that's

1580
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,520
that's all we're trying to do

1581
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,280
what happened on that device what were

1582
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,000
the events that led to an incident that

1583
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,480
we're investigating or the reason behind

1584
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,520
us doing this investigation

1585
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,880
everything we do

1586
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,799
has to be repeatable

1587
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:03,119
and that's why we follow best practice

1588
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,400
guidelines we follow accepted

1589
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,160
methodology

1590
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,079
because that's been that's what

1591
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,079
everybody knows that's what's proven to

1592
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,119
be a good way of doing it and if we

1593
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,559
write our report we write down

1594
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,119
everything we do i could hand that to a

1595
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,680
colleague they could repeat exactly what

1596
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,920
i did and come to the same conclusion

1597
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,000
that's that's the reason that we do

1598
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
everything following all of these these

1599
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,119
guidelines and and methodologies

1600
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,200
based on our current understanding our

1601
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,559
understanding

1602
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,240
changes as

1603
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,680
everything generally does particularly

1604
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,119
with technology

1605
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,160
it evolves it adapts over time as new

1606
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,599
operating systems come out new

1607
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,440
applications come out we discover new

1608
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,319
artifacts artifacts change potentially

1609
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,400
over time

1610
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,839
that the whole field is constantly

1611
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,040
evolving so as does our understanding of

1612
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,839
of devices of processes of tools of

1613
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,839
everything that we rely on on digital

1614
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:00,799
forensics we need to ask the right

1615
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,760
questions

1616
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,160
one of the skills in digital forensics

1617
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,760
is about

1618
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,839
asking learning to ask questions what

1619
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,000
are the questions we should be asking

1620
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,760
what questions can we answer and what

1621
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,280
questions can't we answer and we need to

1622
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,319
make sure we back up all of our answers

1623
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,720
with corroborating evidence

1624
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,799
if we find one artifact that tells us

1625
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,640
one thing that happens we need to try

1626
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,559
and get as much corroborating evidence

1627
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:29,119
as possible to back that up before we

1628
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,359
produce our report before we we

1629
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,599
reach our conclusions

1630
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,760
so that's why why we have it why we do

1631
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,119
it and why we do it in depth

1632
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,119
agpo principles i mentioned came in the

1633
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,119
late 1990s

1634
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,680
this was a team of uk

1635
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,839
chief police officers uh just because it

1636
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,160
was developed in the uk don't be don't

1637
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,599
be fooled it is used globally and it was

1638
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,200
the first

1639
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,480
standard that came out the first

1640
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,640
guidelines that came out so this was

1641
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,359
widely adopted everywhere and a lot of

1642
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,440
the current standards we have today are

1643
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,079
based on exactly these principles and it

1644
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,079
consists of four principles

1645
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,680
principle one do not do anything

1646
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,200
that will change your data if possible

1647
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,720
principle two

1648
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,880
says it may be possible to sometimes

1649
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,280
access original data which will change

1650
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,799
that data

1651
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,559
if you need to do that

1652
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,480
make sure the person doing so is

1653
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,760
competent

1654
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,839
and they are able to explain exactly

1655
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,240
what they did and the implications of

1656
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,079
what they did

1657
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,520
principle three says document everything

1658
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,760
write everything down create an audit

1659
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,319
trail document exactly what you did and

1660
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,839
when you did it

1661
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,319
principle four says that somebody needs

1662
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,160
to be ultimately

1663
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,839
in charge of the investigation and

1664
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,280
responsible for the entire team adhering

1665
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,200
to these principles and

1666
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,598
the law

1667
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,400
so putting that into practice principle

1668
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,440
one

1669
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,480
if possible don't change the evidence

1670
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,400
if we can use a right blocker so a write

1671
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,119
blocker is just a device

1672
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,119
it may be software it may be hardware

1673
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:13,839
but you put it between your evidence

1674
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,640
item your electronic device and your

1675
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,960
analysis machine and it just stops your

1676
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,960
analysis machine from writing to your

1677
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,240
evidence

1678
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,280
if we can do that we should do that

1679
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,880
there are circumstances where you can't

1680
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,559
do that and that moves on to to

1681
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,160
principle two

1682
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,760
and principle two

1683
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,799
says

1684
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,480
there are some cases where you need to

1685
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,400
access the original data

1686
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,039
for example if i'm acquiring a mobile

1687
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,799
device i

1688
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,000
can't

1689
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,160
pull it apart and remove the hard drive

1690
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,319
i need to turn that device on to access

1691
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:49,359
the data i'm accessing it live

1692
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,599
in that instance i can't use a right

1693
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,280
blocker

1694
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,319
i

1695
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,480
just have to be able to explain

1696
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,319
exactly what i did

1697
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,720
did i change the data any in any way

1698
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,520
what data did i change

1699
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,039
what are the implications of the actions

1700
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,760
i did on that particular device

1701
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,359
because if i can't explain all of those

1702
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,440
things and i go into a courtroom and the

1703
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,680
lawyer stands up and says you change

1704
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,760
this data on the device therefore

1705
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,599
everything you're saying wasn't

1706
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,119
something that my client did it's

1707
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,799
something that you did when you access

1708
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,000
the device

1709
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,720
and it's about being able to explain why

1710
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,960
that that's not an accurate picture of

1711
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,520
what happened

1712
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,920
principle 3 document it

1713
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,599
simple as that

1714
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,119
documentation

1715
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,440
is the non-glamorous side of digital

1716
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,520
forensics but it is

1717
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,720
one of the the most important aspects

1718
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,559
if you didn't if you don't document it

1719
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,880
it didn't happen it is the short version

1720
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,920
to this

1721
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,039
and write everything down when you do it

1722
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,720
as you do it so that you remember

1723
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,720
exactly what happened back it up with

1724
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,640
photographs back it up with videos if

1725
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,119
you can and make sure all of that is is

1726
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,359
properly filed so that you can access it

1727
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,039
when you need to you can refer back to

1728
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,280
notes when you need to write a report

1729
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,160
you can't write too much it's not a

1730
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,720
thing to have written too much down but

1731
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,760
it is a thing to not write enough down

1732
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,280
if you don't write it down and you need

1733
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,200
to then refer back to what you did later

1734
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,520
on and you haven't got those notes guess

1735
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,000
what you have to do it all again and

1736
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,880
that's not fun so write everything down

1737
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,920
and

1738
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,000
write down more than you think is is

1739
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,920
enough

1740
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,359
last but not least in the aqua

1741
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:34,480
principles

1742
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,319
someone has to be in charge

1743
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:37,760
basically

1744
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,480
you can delegate responsibility for

1745
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,559
particular tasks for collecting evidence

1746
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,559
for writing a report but not

1747
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,559
accountability somebody has to be

1748
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,440
accountable to make sure the team is

1749
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,359
properly qualified they have the right

1750
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:52,480
skills

1751
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,079
the right competency they know what

1752
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,200
they're doing

1753
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,799
they are following the standards they

1754
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,480
should be following they are doing their

1755
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,720
documentation they're adhering to the

1756
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,000
law they're getting getting

1757
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,799
authorizations when they need to

1758
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,640
all of those things

1759
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,400
one person has to be accountable for

1760
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,640
that and and that's all principle for

1761
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,118
states

1762
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,400
i just want to throw in this slide here

1763
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:17,760
to say

1764
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,400
be wary of the expert label i personally

1765
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,400
hate the word expert

1766
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,200
um

1767
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,359
expert has specific

1768
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,680
specific meaning specific connotations i

1769
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,920
think so i tend to use the word

1770
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,359
specialist

1771
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,520
practitioners need to understand

1772
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,359
what their own strengths and weaknesses

1773
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:37,280
are and

1774
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,720
what the strengths and weaknesses of

1775
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,319
their team are everyone has limitations

1776
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:43,760
you can be

1777
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,920
really really good and know loads and

1778
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,160
loads of things about say windows

1779
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,240
artifacts on a windows system but maybe

1780
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,160
you don't look at mac systems very often

1781
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,760
so you're not

1782
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,599
as confident you don't have as many

1783
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,920
skills on the mac os system

1784
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,760
maybe you don't do

1785
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,760
reverse engineering of malware very

1786
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,079
often so you're not a specialist in that

1787
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,280
maybe you don't do memory analysis that

1788
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,240
often

1789
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,319
everyone has their own areas that they

1790
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:13,359
they specialize in and one person cannot

1791
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,200
know everything about all of those

1792
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,640
things so an expert in digital forensics

1793
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,480
all of digital forensics

1794
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,559
is isn't a thing uh people will

1795
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,960
specialize in in one topic or

1796
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,839
a few topics but everyone can't know

1797
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,760
everything about everything

1798
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,720
so

1799
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,799
i try and avoid the word expert i would

1800
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,039
use specialist and

1801
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,760
it's important to understand

1802
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,960
your own limitations your team's

1803
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,799
limitations and also get that point

1804
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,319
across your stakeholders because

1805
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,000
stakeholders

1806
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,119
can expect a lot they may not understand

1807
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,280
where the limitations are in a team

1808
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,920
and you may need to call out specialists

1809
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,400
in from an external team or

1810
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,799
external organization if you need to to

1811
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,920
fill gaps in reporting and get the

1812
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,440
the right results for your particular

1813
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,839
investigation don't be afraid to do that

1814
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,440
have those relationships built up in

1815
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,559
advance

1816
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,200
and make sure your client understands

1817
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,160
what you can and can't do

1818
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,000
there are many challenges as i mentioned

1819
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,359
that we come across

1820
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,079
just to name a few

1821
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,440
well yeah

1822
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,359
i probably won't cover all of these um

1823
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,160
but

1824
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,359
things like

1825
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,599
rapidly changing technology updates are

1826
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,280
happening all the time to operating

1827
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,359
systems to applications

1828
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,280
that changes artifacts and we need to

1829
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,680
know how those artifacts change maybe

1830
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,680
they change location maybe they change

1831
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,760
the way they store data the amount of

1832
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,079
data stored

1833
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,839
maybe they compress data now when they

1834
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,839
didn't before

1835
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,480
we have devices that are storing more

1836
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:49,760
data

1837
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,520
you now have a smartphone that comes in

1838
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,880
256 gigs by default it used to be

1839
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,839
4 gigs or eight gigs a few years ago

1840
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,240
so everything is just blowing up in size

1841
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,880
more data is stored in the cloud which

1842
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,359
may or may not be accessible to you and

1843
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,160
in an investigation

1844
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,559
trying to recruit people into digital

1845
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,079
forensic teams can be difficult uh we

1846
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,200
are

1847
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,719
an interesting breed

1848
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,399
we

1849
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,560
we're quite analytical uh you kind of

1850
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,719
need people who

1851
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,719
want to to investigate to dig into the

1852
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,759
data to question things and and come up

1853
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,319
with the the right conclusions

1854
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,158
you also need people who

1855
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,198
can

1856
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:34,319
look at

1857
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,120
data all day you can look at hex and not

1858
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,000
go cross-eyed um can

1859
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:40,880
do

1860
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,960
difficult cases you may have cases

1861
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,520
involving child abuse involving homicide

1862
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,000
involving co-workers if you're doing

1863
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,520
internal hr cases so you need people

1864
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,120
who can who can deal with that and you

1865
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,279
need to be able to support the mental

1866
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,600
health of your team in doing those sorts

1867
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,040
of cases

1868
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,719
you need to keep up with the field the

1869
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,439
field changes all the time

1870
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,120
there's new tools coming out new

1871
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,679
artifacts coming out and it's a bit of a

1872
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,679
cat and mouse game when it comes to to

1873
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,359
all those types of things

1874
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,080
so ongoing education is is critical to

1875
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,520
keeping the team

1876
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,520
current keeping them up to date on on

1877
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,279
everything

1878
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,799
tools are great we also need to

1879
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,238
understand how to look at the data

1880
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,439
manually

1881
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,359
we can become over reliant on tools and

1882
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,759
just click click click click buttons but

1883
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,600
we need to make sure we can verify that

1884
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,920
their output is correct so we need to

1885
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,319
still have those skills and capabilities

1886
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,960
to be able to do manual analysis and

1887
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,960
verify our tools are working and we

1888
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,719
should always be verifying that our

1889
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,839
tools are working as we expect

1890
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,759
you may get unsupported devices things

1891
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,759
like internet of things devices may not

1892
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,319
be supported by tools so what do we do

1893
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,359
with that

1894
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,839
they are they are still challenges

1895
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,440
encryption is becoming more and more

1896
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,679
common and anti-forensics

1897
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,000
may be a thing on your particular case

1898
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,760
and if an attacker has deleted all of

1899
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,560
the evidence then that's a big challenge

1900
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,920
when it comes to doing an investigation

1901
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,760
last but not least

1902
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,120
how can digital forensics help you what

1903
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,800
type of investigations do we do what

1904
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,840
type of artifacts do we come across

1905
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,679
here is just a small number of the types

1906
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,000
of artifacts you may come across on

1907
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,040
different systems on on networks on on

1908
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,120
all sorts of different things

1909
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,440
this red poster here is windows

1910
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,679
artifacts so these are all available and

1911
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,480
from from suns through your portal

1912
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,880
and i have these plastered all over my

1913
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,040
my walls because i'm referring to them

1914
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,840
constantly you're never going to

1915
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,280
remember everything

1916
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,120
so just have these to hand so you can

1917
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,600
refer to them the the red poster i say

1918
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,840
is all windows artifacts this gray one

1919
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,760
here is network forensics

1920
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,600
you have finding malware on this blue

1921
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,600
one how do you know

1922
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,080
what's normal and what processes should

1923
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,920
be running versus what is running on

1924
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,280
your system

1925
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,040
memory forensics

1926
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,360
and smartphone forensics uh there's a

1927
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,880
another one just come out as well that

1928
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,440
uh matia afani wrote which is all about

1929
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,840
third-party applications on smartphones

1930
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,480
as well so and there are plenty of other

1931
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,040
posters available um but these are

1932
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,880
really good reference sheets

1933
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,800
and you're not meant to be able to read

1934
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,719
all of these things it's just to show

1935
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,199
you this year's scale really of the

1936
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,880
different artifacts that that are

1937
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,960
available that are out there and that we

1938
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,040
use in different types of investigation

1939
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,960
to just walk through

1940
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,560
towards the end don't worry we're coming

1941
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,480
to the end um just to walk through an

1942
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,960
example of the types of artifact that

1943
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,280
might be useful in a particular case

1944
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,880
i'm going to talk about malware

1945
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,360
execution this is a malware case

1946
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,640
the first thing

1947
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,400
that i would be looking at on a windows

1948
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,760
system is evidence of program execution

1949
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,640
which applications ran on the system

1950
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,159
when did they run

1951
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,880
which applications ran immediately after

1952
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,960
an application ran what other artifacts

1953
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,560
were created immediately after that

1954
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,760
thing run

1955
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,360
so we're going to start with the red

1956
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,080
poster and the red box looking at

1957
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,440
windows

1958
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,920
starting with things like prefetch which

1959
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,080
shows applications that run on the

1960
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,239
system it will give you dates and times

1961
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,400
that that application ran

1962
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,480
it will also potentially show you

1963
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,719
files that were accessed by that

1964
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,280
application when it last run so you can

1965
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,159
then potentially also dig into into

1966
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:33,760
those files

1967
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,960
i'm going to look at things like event

1968
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,199
logs depending on what event logging is

1969
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,960
turned on will depend on how much

1970
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:40,880
information that might give you

1971
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,159
but that might give you useful

1972
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,400
information about what ran on that

1973
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,600
system

1974
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,840
information in the registry things like

1975
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,159
most recently used will again show you

1976
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,920
what applications run

1977
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,000
and and we can add all of these things

1978
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,480
together user assist same thing

1979
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,440
at the activity cache database s windows

1980
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,239
10 timeline jump lists all of these

1981
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,560
things will give you

1982
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,920
different slightly different evidence

1983
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,480
but corroborating evidence on which

1984
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,600
applications run on that system

1985
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,480
from there we can then look at

1986
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,600
other other types of data so what

1987
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,000
also happened around the same time i

1988
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,960
mentioned prefetch data may give you

1989
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
evidence of which files were accessed by

1990
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,520
that application we can then look at

1991
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,800
evidence of file access so things like

1992
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,560
mru list most recently used lists in the

1993
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,679
registry

1994
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,480
which files were opened by the user

1995
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,719
which files were um

1996
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,199
saved by the user at that particular

1997
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,520
point in time shell bags shows us which

1998
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,920
folders were accessed at that particular

1999
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,320
point in time we can look at shortcuts

2000
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,400
so link files will show us which files

2001
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,640
were accessed at a particular point in

2002
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:53,760
time

2003
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
we can back this up with with jump lists

2004
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,600
with other recent data

2005
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,120
all of this again is corroborating

2006
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,719
evidence as to

2007
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,440
what happened at that point in time so

2008
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,600
we've seen an application run we can

2009
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,440
note the timestamp of that and we can

2010
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,920
then pivot from that and say what else

2011
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,760
happened at that point in time what

2012
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,280
files and folders were accessed at

2013
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,000
around the same time immediately before

2014
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,320
and immediately after that malware run

2015
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,679
and then from there

2016
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:23,040
where do we go

2017
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,280
we can look to see we need to find out

2018
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,600
where that malware came from so we can

2019
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,000
look for evidence of usb devices being

2020
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,040
connected

2021
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,159
again we're going to look in the

2022
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,880
registry there will potentially be as

2023
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,960
from the usb store key

2024
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,440
any usbs that were created we can get

2025
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,800
the

2026
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,719
the a model we can get the serial number

2027
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:43,920
and we can get some time stamps

2028
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,920
associated with that we can get the

2029
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,000
volume name the drive letter it was

2030
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,480
mounted as we can look in link files and

2031
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,040
see which files were accessed from that

2032
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,960
usb device

2033
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,880
we can also look in things like browser

2034
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,600
usage what browsers are on that system

2035
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,760
look in browser history to see where any

2036
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,840
files accessed

2037
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,960
uh is were any websites visited was it

2038
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,880
downloaded was it a drive by download

2039
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,800
from a particular website did it come

2040
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,560
from email did they access email through

2041
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,600
the browser and maybe it was downloaded

2042
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:18,159
that way so we can again we can pivot

2043
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:21,360
again around that same timestamp to look

2044
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,280
for each of these different ways in to

2045
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,440
see how did that malware get on that

2046
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,920
particular system

2047
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,239
and often you'll get the user saying i

2048
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:32,480
didn't do it someone else must have done

2049
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,320
was it actually malware or did the user

2050
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,040
do it this is we always need to to start

2051
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,800
with our hypothesis

2052
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,239
try and look for evidence of that

2053
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,480
happening try and look for evidence

2054
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,640
specifically saying that didn't happen

2055
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,840
and then

2056
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,440
go from there and try and reach the

2057
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,040
right conclusion so

2058
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,239
we've started this as a malware

2059
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,480
investigation but maybe it wasn't maybe

2060
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,040
the user actually did these actions and

2061
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,560
by looking at the evidence we can

2062
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,520
determine that that happened
