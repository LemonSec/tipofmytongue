1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,520
good morning good morning so i want to introduce 
jackie coven and jackie's going to do to the moon  

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:20,000
the cyber kill chain thank you for joining us 
perfect thanks so much okay well good morning  

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
good afternoon good evening wherever you are in 
the world watching this today i'm jackie burns  

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,040
covent and i'm so delighted to be here at the 
dfir summit i fully recognize that blockchain is  

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,800
a bit of an oddball in this otherwise terrific 
lineup but i i'm pretty used to it by now uh  

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,000
blockchain is transcending a number of different 
industries and at analysis i'm engaging with  

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
banks cyber security teams and law enforcement 
all folks who entered their professions never  

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,280
dreaming that cryptocurrency would ever be a part 
of it right and now it's playing an integral role  

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,680
but as karma would have it i never expected 
ransomware to be a part of my job description  

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,720
and now i can say that i've been investigating 
ransomware on the blockchain for the better part  

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,120
of three years now at analysis so if you fall 
into that camp of you're unsure or curious of  

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,640
how all this crypto stuff applies to you and 
your work welcome i aim to share with you what  

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
i'm seeing in the field and hope to introduce 
you to a new arrow in your quiver perhaps  

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,040
and if you know a bit about cryptocurrency maybe 
you've encountered it in your role i hope to help  

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
you see how you can enrich that information 
into valuable intelligence and evidence  

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,839
so let's see if i can control these slides um

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,680
excuse me well hiccup great we'll go into some 
examples today of how blockchain forensics  

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,120
has been a complementary lens for technical 
analysis we'll walk through some case studies  

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,400
on what cryptocurrency data can contribute 
towards objectives of prevention attribution  

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,840
and response and even asset recovery but 
in order to leverage cryptocurrency in  

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,680
dfir investigations we must first come to 
grips with some core concepts and dispel  

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,840
some commonly held misconceptions so we're gonna 
kick it off with a quick myth busting exercise

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,399
okay our first myth only 
criminals use cryptocurrency  

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
have you heard this one before have 
you maybe tweeted it out yourself  

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,960
it's okay it's easy to believe this myth when 
you're inundated with headlines about things like  

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:44,160
ransomware but it is false we calculated actually 
um in 2020 in our crypto crime report that of  

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
the three trillion dollars of cryptocurrency 
activity last year less than one percent of that  

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,519
was illicit so while we're gonna be focused 
on the darker uses of cryptocurrency today  

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,960
it's important to keep in mind there are plenty of 
good guys in the ecosystem who can actually be an  

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:08,080
asset for you following an incident and we'll 
talk more about that later so for our second myth

31
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:17,680
you may have also heard that cryptocurrency is 
anonymous i have even heard a former head of cisa  

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,920
who i quite admire repeat this myth when 
interviewed on a talk show earlier this  

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,600
year but it's simply not true crypto is rather 
pseudonymous and blockchain forensics tools enable  

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,680
you to follow the money and overlay enrichment 
about where that money went and serves as trusted  

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:45,280
evidence in court okay last one cryptocurrency 
doesn't touch my work okay so this is a trickier  

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,920
one and it's one i told myself for a long time 
actually i was investigating financially motivated  

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,519
threat actors and yet i wasn't looking or 
considering any financial indicators or artifacts  

38
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
it sounds kind of crazy when i say it out loud 
right but historically we never had access to  

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,120
financial institute financial information uh in 
the traditional fiat world there are walls between  

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,200
financial institutions different payment rails 
impossible to piece together without a subpoena  

41
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,079
several weeks and months of red tape 
but with cryptocurrency those walls  

42
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,240
all but evaporate and i don't pretend to know 
your job better than you do but i hope that  

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,200
if you don't see a direct connection to crypto 
today that you at least see the potential for  

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:42,240
it to enter your circles in the future so 
let's actually unpack some of these myths

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,160
so we've established illicit activity comprises 
just a small fraction of the overall crypto  

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,880
economy so what do people do with crypto well some 
view cryptocurrency as an asset class and store  

47
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,760
value so many crypto hodlers as they're called 
will hold their cryptocurrency expecting the price  

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,480
to climb to the moon see infosec community you're 
not the only ones with quirky lore and naming  

49
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:16,320
convec conventions um speaking of you can actually 
rick roll somebody's cryptocurrency wallet that's  

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,840
probably all i needed to say to convince some 
of you out there not to sleep on crypto but i'm  

51
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,640
getting off track so come find me in the slack 
hallway if you want to hear more on that story  

52
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,240
so back to the point if we've seen this 
massive influx of financial institutions  

53
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,960
and e-commerce platforms embracing crypto it's 
faster it's cheaper for cross-border payments  

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,479
and you can increasingly buy goods and services 
with cryptocurrency yeah even a tesla at one point  

55
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:51,680
this year right so and there's also mining of 
cryptocurrency to generate the crypto so of course  

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
wherever there's money to be made these activities 
can and will be co-opted for nefarious purposes  

57
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,159
cryptocurrency can be used as a mean for money 
laundering and buying and selling a number of  

58
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:12,720
illicit goods but how do we know that we know that 
because cryptocurrency is pseudonymous remember  

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
and we're able to map cryptocurrency addresses 
to real world entities using blockchain analysis  

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,440
so let's take bitcoin as an example a bitcoin 
address contains between 26 and 35 alphanumeric  

61
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,760
characters that provide a unique identifier 
and any transaction is broadcast like you see  

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,360
here on a publicly available ledger you see 
the address is on the left hand side sending  

63
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,240
to those two addresses on the right however you 
can see there's no identifying information as to  

64
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,080
who is sending bitcoin into who right which 
analysis actually translates these seemingly  

65
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,919
nonsensical strings into the parties involved in 
the transaction think of it as creating the phone  

66
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,680
book of hundreds of millions of cryptocurrency 
addresses we use advanced analytics proprietary  

67
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,480
heuristics even ground truth research we've mapped 
these entities to translate this transaction  

68
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,720
you see on the left into the transfer between 
a merchant service provider called coinify  

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,760
to a cryptocurrency exchange called bitstamp so 
taking the same methodology you can also track  

70
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,800
that threat actor selling stolen credit 
cards or auctioning off exfiltrated data  

71
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,400
or paying an access broker now cyber threat actors 
are getting more creative and finding new ways to  

72
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,840
steal it scam it create it extort it just to name 
a few emerging areas we have crypto skimming this  

73
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,640
is actually a newer term for me personally crypto 
jacking also known as crypto mining you have the  

74
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,680
wholesale hacking of exchanges and draining of 
their accounts and sim swapping on individuals  

75
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,360
and of course there's the elephant in the room and 
destroyer of fourth of july weekends ransomware

76
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,320
and because all of you are in incident response i 
don't need to tell you that ransomware is on the  

77
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,719
rise and i mean that in every respect first of all 
overall revenue from ransom payments has increased  

78
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:24,080
dramatically and our figures literally change by 
the day and while we know our tools our totals  

79
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,280
comprise a lower bound estimate of the overall 
ransomer amount were on pace to beat last year  

80
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,079
already in terms of ransoms paid out and last 
year was a record year further to that the average  

81
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,840
ransom payment demanded is increasing we've 
been able to see through blockchain forensics  

82
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:50,880
also the number of unique actors participating 
in the ecosystem has increased so we're able to  

83
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,960
actually see threat actors previously involved 
in other types of cyber cyber enabled crime  

84
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,800
adapting their craft toward the booming business 
of ransomware but there is a silver lining in  

85
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,160
that we are seeing an increased turnover and in 
terms of ransomware group closures and takedowns  

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,200
and here's really where we get into the 
functionality of blockchain forensics for dfir  

87
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,360
and really why this matters what i'm showing 
you here is just a handful of examples we  

88
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
can publicly share about how investigators 
have leveraged cryptocurrency as an artifact  

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,400
in investigations to lead to attribution and 
disruption of a broad spectrum of threat actors  

90
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,640
highlighted in orange we see the 
charging of a russian national  

91
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,760
for operating a dirty uh cryptocurrency 
exchange called btc-e that was used for  

92
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
laundering criminal proceeds of syndicates around 
the world including multiple ransomware campaigns  

93
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,640
and then further to the right we have the 
identification of cryptocurrency wallets and  

94
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,160
accomplices of the lazarus group involved in the 
sony hack the creation of one acquired ransomware  

95
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,560
and attacks on banks and and further to the 
right there was also a cryptocurrency nexus  

96
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,280
to the russian influence operations detailed this 
past april including affiliations with ransomware  

97
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,040
groups and as for networker we're going to 
talk about this in more detail in a moment

98
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,400
so this is all to say that if you take 
away just one thing from this session  

99
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:39,360
i want it to be that crypto underpins all kinds of 
cyber intrusion beyond those cryptocentric crimes  

100
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,120
that we've just reviewed and that is because 
attacks are not monolithic they are complex  

101
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,680
and blended as threat actors host a variety of 
professional tools and services at their disposal  

102
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,839
in the underground economy they can buy 
exploits c2 domains fishing kits access  

103
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,920
all these things being bought and sold with 
cryptocurrency the availability of these  

104
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,280
components has contributed to a rapid 
professionalization of the underground  

105
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:17,680
led to attack sophistication it has also caused 
complexities with attribution where threat actors  

106
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,560
may be leveraging the same malware as a service 
independent of the other but they're not related  

107
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,560
and this is where blockchain analysis can 
in some cases augment other technical needs

108
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,720
we can see precisely what's in these threat 
actors shopping carts through blockchain  

109
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,800
forensics which enables us to personify that 
data map out networks like this rendering here  

110
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,920
and you'll also start to see centers of 
gravity in the ecosystem start to emerge  

111
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
in connections form for 
strategic and tactical aims

112
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,120
to put this in a framework most of you are 
familiar with we've overlaid a threat actor  

113
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,800
shopping cart onto the lockheed martin cyberkill 
chain cryptocurrency can propel a campaign through  

114
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,000
each one of these steps in the kill chain but 
what i really want you to take away from this  

115
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,400
is that having just one of the transactions from 
any one of these stages for a particular threat  

116
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,079
actor can actually reveal all or most 
of the previous or subsequent purchases  

117
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:30,400
in the campaign and then following a successful 
attack we can actually see the threat actor  

118
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:38,480
reinvesting those profits scams stolen extorted 
or otherwise into their next campaign and we can  

119
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,600
see additional purchases purchases of access 
brute forcing tools botnets and the like

120
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,360
and the reason i get so excited about this is that 
a single cryptocurrency address from an incident  

121
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,440
or leading up to an incident can help us identify 
the attack supply chain and supplement in some  

122
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,080
cases technical means we can also alert for 
connections with sanctions or alert you in  

123
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:12,880
cases where stolen funds or extorted funds move 
cryptocurrency data also has joined keys with  

124
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,040
existing data sets and platforms for those 
of you dealing with the legal ramifications  

125
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,040
of incidents blockchain data is used in court 
and we have lots of proof points to that effect  

126
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,960
which is why a growing number of global law 
enforcement are leveraging it as well so for dfir  

127
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:40,160
professionals coordinating with law enforcement or 
a regulatory body or even a client blockchain data  

128
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,480
platform serves as a common operating picture and 
common language between public and private sector  

129
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,800
so if you're in a time sensitive high dollar 
incident what better way to keep all eyes on  

130
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,719
the ball and have that coordinated action on 
your side for asset recovery or case building  

131
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:07,360
so i want to turn it over to some real world 
examples to actually show you this in practice

132
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,080
so i'll only touch upon prevention briefly 
whether your team is focused on a specific set of  

133
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,600
threat actors or a type of attack or malware 
the idea is that you understand changes  

134
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,720
in ttps or indicators of attack prep at the 
point of sale versus the point of attack  

135
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,280
and in some cases you might learn 
off of the attack of someone else  

136
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,520
where there's evidence on the blockchain to glean 
so you can monitor that threat actor shopping part  

137
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,480
or maybe you didn't pay that ransom but 
you can unravel that ransomware network  

138
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,120
from someone else who did and this 
helps inform preventative measures

139
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
so you've heard me say that with 
a single cryptocurrency address  

140
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,960
um belonging to a threat actor we can unravel 
the components of an attack soup to nuts so on  

141
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:14,320
the left hand side you can see domains email file 
hosting purchases and you'll you'll note in this  

142
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,520
case where threat actors are co-opting clear net 
legitimate services uh that we've anonymized here  

143
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,439
but they also leverage the dark web too so 
on the right hand side you can see a malware  

144
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,560
as a service provider making purchases off the 
dark web including from ssndob this is exactly  

145
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,400
what it sounds like it's an invite-only forum 
specializing in social security numbers and pii  

146
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,720
but at the bottom right you can actually 
see the use of a cryptocurrency exchange  

147
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,480
these are clear net services mostly regulated 
that play an important role in incident response

148
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,800
exchanges are businesses used to convert crypto to 
cash or your cash to crypto when you need crypto  

149
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,000
to buy stuff on the criminal underground 
you need an exchange if you need to convert  

150
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,240
your spoils from a cryptocurrency heist or 
extortion to fiat currency you need an exchange  

151
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,440
so cyber criminals eventually need to move their 
crypto to fiat sure we've established you can  

152
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,520
purchase an increasingly amount increasing 
amount of goods um with cryptocurrency today  

153
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:36,160
just not everything as we like to say it's 
analysis even bad guys got to pay rent or okay  

154
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,520
if you're the head of evil core you've got to 
pay for your custom lamborghini or whatever but  

155
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,439
at some point you're going to want to convert 
that pilfered extorted scammed crypto to cash  

156
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,080
and if we look at this chart on 
the right this is showing you  

157
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,800
where ransomware wallets as a whole send 
their funds and we see that overwhelmingly  

158
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,960
they they send their funds to exchanges in orange 
and this is followed by mixing services in gray  

159
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,480
and these exchanges for the most part are 
regulated they require kyc or know your customer  

160
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,440
information on their individual customers 
exchanges also use the same enriched blockchain  

161
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,440
data platform as cyber teams and law enforcement 
we work with and so if you see funds wind up at  

162
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:32,400
a particular exchange they can be helpful in 
identifying the attacker or an accomplice even  

163
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,920
in asset recovery and our overall an incredible 
force multiplier following an incident to be sure

164
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,360
we can also learn a lot about an attacker just 
by examining the exchange that he cashes out at  

165
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,160
himself and cashing out i mean converting that 
crypto to cash this attribution piece becomes  

166
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,440
really important for legal and regulatory dilemmas 
that can arise from an incident especially when it  

167
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,280
comes to sanctions the incident response firm 
profero actually had an interesting application  

168
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,240
of blockchain forensics last year where they are 
investigating a new previously unseen and wild  

169
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,880
variant going by the name pizza key ransomware 
and it was targeting primarily israeli victims  

170
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,600
here you can actually see where one victim sourced 
their bitcoin and it was from an israeli exchange  

171
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,920
noted by the dot il then they paid 
the ransom to the paid a key wallet  

172
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
then pataki converged several ransom payments 
from several victims before transferring  

173
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,760
to an intermediary wallet where they then 
cashed out converted that bitcoin to cash  

174
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,560
at an exchange but it wasn't just any exchange 
it was xcoino.com which is an iranian exchange  

175
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,720
and so the blockchain forensics in this 
case provided that confirmatory intelligence  

176
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,360
of what had only been speculated at that 
time that these actors were based out of iran

177
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,879
there's also a scenario we encounter where 
two variants may technically look a lot alike  

178
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,720
encrypt the same way leverage the same loader 
maybe exhibit similar random note styles but  

179
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,440
there are some differences so are they related 
or do they use the same commodity malware  

180
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
if they are related then how is it the 
same developer is it a splinter group  

181
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
that's why i found this case study from 
recorded future on bulletproof hosting  

182
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,920
providers so interesting and it's a really 
great report if you haven't checked it out  

183
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,600
and they had some data points about dharma and 
phobos ransomware potential overlap but then when  

184
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,679
they investigated through blockchain forensics 
they found additional evidence both variants  

185
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,560
used the same bulletproof hosting providers but 
not only that they cash out at the same exchange  

186
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,919
but not only the same exchange the 
same deposit address of the exchange  

187
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,600
this is interesting recalling what we 
talked about earlier that exchanges  

188
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,920
have kyc those know your customer 
requirements on specific accounts  

189
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,280
so hold tight i have one more example and 
we can unpack that concept a little bit

190
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,480
okay if you look on the left this is another 
example of two totally distinct uh distinctly  

191
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,480
named ransomware variants likely trying to 
obfuscate an overt connection between the two  

192
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,360
maybe one strain had been outed as a 
potential sanctions risk or something but  

193
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,600
you see them using not only the same exchange but 
the same deposit address at the exchange again  

194
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,960
and so i want you to think of a deposit address at 
an exchange like a bank account so this could mean  

195
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,960
two threat actors are sharing the same banking 
account that's pretty unlikely look i don't care  

196
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,360
how well you get along with your co-workers you 
might wear matching hawaiian shirts on fridays  

197
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,800
which is what they do on my team but on payday you 
don't want your paycheck going to the same account  

198
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:31,440
you don't want to commingle your funds with your 
co-workers sorry guys so this case is actually  

199
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,600
showing the developer of those two distinctly 
named strains is one and the same this technique  

200
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,360
can also be used to identify affiliates by the 
way playing goldilocks across different variants  

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,360
but this workflow is becoming increasingly 
important amid the tremendous volatility in  

202
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,399
the space right now in terms of ransomware 
groups dropping and swapping names because  

203
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,560
they're pressured because reputational damage or 
because they've been outed as a sanctions risk so  

204
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,879
blockchain and analytics in this case can help you 
actually understand who is behind what and whether  

205
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,600
it was just a rebranding of an earlier variant 
that we've seen before on the right hand side  

206
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,840
is an example of how we could actually confirm 
what other research researchers had summarized  

207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,959
via technical analysis that ryuk and kanti are 
cut from the same cloth now just as we're seeing  

208
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,200
variants obfuscate connections to other variants 
we're also starting to see opportunistic threat  

209
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,120
actors trying to capitalize off of the notoriety 
of some other ransomware gangs by adopting their  

210
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:49,360
names and trying to impersonate them so ryuk is 
just such an example so security joes identified a  

211
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,399
reboot builder impersonator last month but when 
you plot that ryuk impersonator's address out  

212
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,680
it does not match the real reik's financial 
signatures at all so that also confirmed that

213
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,160
so we've talked about ttps legal and regulatory 
risk attribution threat resolution now i want  

214
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:22,080
to touch upon disruption and even asset recovery 
so netwalker ransomware this was a ransomware as  

215
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,120
a service so we're introducing affiliates to the 
complexity of this network we tracked at least 78  

216
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,800
million dollars in ransom payments to netwalker 
over 300 victims and at least 27 countries and  

217
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,159
those victims include healthcare clinics 
and healthcare facilities it's pretty awful  

218
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,320
fast forward to january of this year authorities 
took down the dark websites run by the networker  

219
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,200
gang and arrested a canadian national responsible 
for around 90 attacks worth 14 million dollars in  

220
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:04,240
bitcoin at the time of receipt furthermore a half 
a million dollars was actually seized from the  

221
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,800
arrested affiliate and blockchain forensics 
was used in support of this investigation  

222
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,600
and you can see from the graph on the right how 
blockchain analysis enables you to disambiguate  

223
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,719
the reven square network tease out roles 
accomplices commission support underlying supply  

224
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,680
chain of the attack their wallets their spending 
habits and extract that identifying information  

225
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,840
so pretty cool yeah you love to see it i did want 
to end on an opportunistic excuse me an optimistic  

226
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:42,159
note um okay we have covered a lot of ground 
so i do want to leave you with some resources

227
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,600
and just remember blockchain forensics is 
new for just about everyone so please don't  

228
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,959
be intimidated if you see you if you've seen 
or heard phrases that you're not familiar with  

229
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,520
we have a lot of good resources on our website 
genealogist.com we have free reports from general  

230
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,879
overviews of the cyber enabled criminal 
landscape to deep dives into specific  

231
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,320
aspects of crime or laundering webinars uh really 
good training offerings from the very basics what  

232
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,000
is bitcoin how does mining work to even more 
advanced concepts and investigative techniques  

233
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,440
we also post threat intel reports 
on specific events and threat actors  

234
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,880
like north korea's use of cryptocurrency to 
purchase attack infrastructure for instance  

235
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,440
i can post some of these in the slack hallway if 
you're interested um but thanks so much for your  

236
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,880
attention thanks again to the stanz institute 
for this fantastic summit and please find me in  

237
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,080
the slack hallway or on twitter or email if 
you want to chat further so thank you again

238
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,360
jackie that was fantastic does anyone have any 
specific questions i'm down at the bottom of the  

239
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,879
chat now because there were a lot the question 
about okay have you seen you know anonymity  

240
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,600
currencies like dash and zcash great question 
all of them i yeah so i'm not trying to ignore  

241
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,919
anybody i do want to get to you i'll do a quick 
response on the privacy coins or anonymity coins  

242
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:30,240
so there are certain cryptocurrencies dash c cash 
monero that do have privacy enhancing capabilities  

243
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,719
but we're not really seeing them take take hold 
in the criminal underground and there's a couple  

244
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,120
reasons for that liquidity being one of them a 
lot of exchanges have dropped support of these  

245
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,959
cryptocurrencies altogether so they're really 
hard so if you're a ransomware actor they're  

246
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,240
they're very hard to coach a victim through 
being able to obtain monero and you can't get  

247
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,840
it in large quantities or quickly um and the other 
point is bitcoin is doing really well financially  

248
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,080
um and a lot of if you're a ransomware as a 
service provider you want to be your affiliates  

249
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,159
to be able to use the cryptocurrency like bitcoin 
um because that's the preferred currency so  

250
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:22,480
we are seeing overwhelmingly that bitcoin is 
still king in as far as criminal activity goes

251
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,720
and i do want to get to these other questions 
in the chat so thank you so much for submitting  

252
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,120
them and thank you for your time jackie 
question for you really quickly do you  

253
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,239
have a training roadmap that you recommend a lot 
of people are asking about that oh that's great  

254
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,400
um i can provide some materials 
in the chat i would start with  

255
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,960
the crypto basics i i know i spent a lot of 
time at the beginning kind of front loading  

256
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,560
how bitcoin operates how the blockchain work 
works and i think that's really important to  

257
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:59,679
understanding how you can leverage it and be 
an informed consumer of blockchain analytic  

258
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,120
data and be able to leverage it yourself so let's 
start with the crypto essentials the crypto 101  

259
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,040
then move into a mapping tool like reactor 
where you can actually map it out yourself  

260
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,160
and a lot of folks in cyber find it very intuitive 
it's no network analysis like you're very familiar
