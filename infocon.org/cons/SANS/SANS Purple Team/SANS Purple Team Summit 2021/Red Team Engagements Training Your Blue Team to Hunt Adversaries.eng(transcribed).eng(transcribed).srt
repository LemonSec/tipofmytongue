1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,160
the title of this is red team

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,359
engagements

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,440
training your blue team to hunt

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,800
adversaries

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
and i had the pleasure of working with

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,240
mad hab

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
and brad um in the weeks leading up to

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,920
here i mentioned earlier that you know

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,680
being part of a sans summit whether it's

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
your first time speaking or your 100th

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,400
time

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
um the advisory board helped us out one

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
choosing all the talks making sure that

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,279
there was a flow

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,040
but then also making sure that the

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,559
slides were good that

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,320
we gave you dry runs and gave you

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
feedback and

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,480
as i was going through this talk i one

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,680
loved it

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,079
and two it's a little bit of a maturity

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,840
model here as well right and of course

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,559
we saw tim

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,440
schultz talk uh about the maturity model

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:49,920
and

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
and and one way of doing it and i think

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,280
just as an

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,960
industry and all of you that are here

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
today right we've had six thousand

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,039
some people registered it's like

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,160
everyone's getting

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
the importance of working together

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,680
right the collaboration and maybe we did

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
it just as like a one-off

35
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
exercise or even a red team exercise

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
uh like tony just talked about but

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
we're done with that exercise and then

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
what's next what do we do next and just

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
as a community we are collaborating with

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,680
each other and sharing

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,240
right so uh madav and brad have gone off

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,080
and they're trying some stuff over at

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,119
credit karma

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,040
uh other folks are trying other things

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
and we're all bringing it back

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,560
and sharing the different things of what

47
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
works what doesn't work

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
and uh it's just very very purple and i

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,520
love it so

50
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,960
without further ado want to introduce

51
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
two offensive security engineers

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,960
uh from credit karma that have an

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,799
amazing presentation for you

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,399
matt have and brad please take it away

55
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
thanks george for introducing us we are

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,840
very excited

57
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
to be here so uh welcome

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,479
good afternoon everyone welcome to our

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
presentation on radio engagements

60
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
training of bluetooth hunter series i'm

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,799
mother with me is my colleague brad

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,399
during this presentation we're gonna

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
talk about a maturity model that you can

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
practically deploy

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,599
and use to continuously improve your

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
detection and response process

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
this is obviously not the only way to do

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
it but this is how we went about it

69
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
so a little bit about ourselves uh i'm

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
an offensive security engineer karma on

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
the left side what you see is my twitter

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,280
handle

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
i occasionally blog on medium some of

74
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
the things we'll talk about

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
uh you can find on my medium blog post

76
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,560
and i sometimes write new tools one of

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:34,879
the

78
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,879
tools that we'll talk about during this

79
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,319
presentation

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,920
and i'll hand it over to brad to

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
introduce himself

82
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
thanks mono good afternoon everyone i am

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
brad richardson

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,239
i'm a offset engineer currently a credit

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,360
karma

86
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,959
and uh you'll see there my twitter

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,959
handle or richard jb

88
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,800
i blog at uh medium where i like to

89
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,280
post practical and interesting security

90
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,159
ideas

91
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,120
or interesting to me when i have free

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,080
time i like to

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,319
write security tools uh that i think

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
would be helpful to the community

95
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
and uh my most recent tool is called

96
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,319
slackhound which is like a

97
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,680
uh swag reconnaissance tool so uh check

98
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
it

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,959
next out please so uh first things first

100
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,840
a little disclaimer uh the opinions

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,959
beliefs and viewpoints

102
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
expressed by the authors that's us

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
um of this presentation do not

104
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,239
necessarily reflect the opinions beliefs

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
and viewpoints

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,080
of our employer so with that out of the

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,519
way

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,480
we'll talk a little bit about our vision

109
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,519
and our vision is

110
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,519
really to arm the blue team with the

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,720
capability

112
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
to take an isolated alert investigate it

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,760
to identify a chain of events

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,319
track it down and ultimately flush the

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
attacker out of the network

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
so for example security wants a robust

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,879
detection and response for pass the hash

118
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,400
if the blue team receives a high

119
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,879
fidelity pass hash detection

120
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
they are able to identify whether the

121
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,080
host that attempted

122
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,799
to pass the hash is the initial point of

123
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
compromise

124
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,439
if not identify how the attacker

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,320
laterally moved

126
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
to this host being it's not the initial

127
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,639
point of compromise

128
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
and also we want to arm them with the

129
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
ability to find the initial point of

130
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
compromise and any subsequent

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
compromises

132
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
to again ultimately flush the attacker

133
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
out of the network

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,080
so to talk about a little bit more in

135
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,919
depth about how we achieve our vision

136
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,759
i'll turn it back to motto

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,919
thanks bro so in order to achieve our

138
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,080
vision we broke down our maturity model

139
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
and four phases now detection chart

140
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,479
purple team exercise adversary detection

141
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,919
pipeline and adverse value

142
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
adversarial services life cycle i'll use

143
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
a little bit of soccer slash for ball

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,360
analogy here

145
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
say you want to play a 90 minutes of

146
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
soccer game right then the basic

147
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
requirement is you have to be match fit

148
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
and you have to practice your basic

149
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
skills like dribbling passing shooting

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and tackling

151
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,520
so the first three phase detection chart

152
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,199
for full team exercise adversary

153
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
detection pipeline these phases make you

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,000
match fit

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
and help you practice you know those

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,199
basic skills

157
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
and then adversarial services life cycle

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
is the friendly match between red and

159
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,919
blue

160
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,080
that helps blue team prepare against

161
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
actual magic and

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
actual adversaries so without further

163
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,160
ado let's jump into the first phase

164
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
first phase is detection chart and if

165
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,680
you look at this you it feels like you

166
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,039
know four different paint book is

167
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,280
exploded on minor attack framework

168
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
obviously there's a method to the

169
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,080
madness so let's understand what is

170
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,120
detection chart so detection chart is

171
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
basically you know it shows

172
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
this detection strength of a ttp on the

173
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,440
scale of zero to three

174
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
so if we take an example of bitsizing

175
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
tdp which is t1197

176
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
if you don't detect bitstem and ttp at

177
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
all you associate with that uh score of

178
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,639
zero

179
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
if you do detect bits i mean tdp but not

180
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,000
its variation

181
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,600
like for example circular is one of the

182
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
variation you can put cash between b

183
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
i t s and your editor can or av2 can

184
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,840
miss that

185
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,080
if those kind of things happen then you

186
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
associate with

187
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
a bit simon gtpa score of one if you do

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
detect bits admin tdp and its variation

189
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
you associate a score of two and if that

190
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,000
tdp is not

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
applicable to your environment uh point

192
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
in case if you are mac only shop you

193
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
don't have to worry about bedside when

194
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,360
you associate a score of three now

195
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,840
uh might attack has a lot of ttps and

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,560
you can't

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,240
do this for every single dtp because

198
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
you'll have to test out every single ttp

199
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,080
to associate the score

200
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,759
so you'll have to prioritize the list of

201
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,600
ttps that you want to test for and in

202
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,199
order to do that you have to know your

203
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,840
environment

204
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,919
and combine it you know with your

205
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
experience as a red teamer to prioritize

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
the list of dpps so once you have you

207
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
know prioritized list of ttps let's talk

208
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,919
about how we can

209
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,680
build attaching chart the process is

210
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
very straightforward uh

211
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,759
first thing you'll need is vms with gold

212
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
image for linux and windows

213
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,080
for macbook obviously you know maybe vms

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
won't work out so you might really need

215
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,000
a test macbook with a cold image

216
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
then you pick a ttp from that

217
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
prioritized list of tdps

218
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
you gather the unit tests for this the

219
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,720
for that ttp

220
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
and the great source is obviously atomic

221
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,639
red team but you also want to add your

222
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
custom test from your own experience as

223
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,919
a red team

224
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
then you run those tests on the gold

225
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
image and at this point automation will

226
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,800
be your friend

227
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,599
the more you can automate the better and

228
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,680
then you go and validate if the alert is

229
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
triggered or not

230
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,280
one thing i want to clarify uh when we

231
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,560
were talking about detection in the

232
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,919
slide before

233
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
when we use the word detection we are

234
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
actually looking for an alert to be

235
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,319
triggered

236
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,639
if you see the ioc is in the log but the

237
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,319
alert is not triggered we

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
rate it as not detected so uh

239
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
just you know mental not of thinking

240
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,280
detection as an alert here

241
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,199
and once you validate whether the alert

242
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,280
is triggered or not you can rate it from

243
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
between zero to two uh based on the

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
previously mentioned criteria

245
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
obviously we are not testing for the ttp

246
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,800
that are not applicable which is a score

247
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
of three

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,400
and when you are done with all the gtps

249
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
in your list

250
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
it will build a foundation for the next

251
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
phase which is the purple theme exercise

252
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,960
before we move into the next phase i'm

253
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
going to talk about a tool

254
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
i wrote detection navigator i used to

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,759
maintain detection chart using

256
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,560
spreadsheet

257
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
and it is not at all scalable so i wrote

258
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
a django based web server

259
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
that helps me you know maintain and

260
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
update uh

261
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
whenever new ttps are released by mitre

262
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
or new version of micro is

263
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,279
um released you can check it out on the

264
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,000
github page or on my blog post

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,919
i want to talk about it a whole lot of

266
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,080
year in the interest of time

267
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
but when you are done with the detection

268
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,279
chart phase

269
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
you would have achieved following one

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
you would have prioritized list of ttps

271
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
that are applicable to your environment

272
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,560
you would provide transparency to your

273
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
leadership in how good or bad

274
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
you are at detecting techniques used by

275
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
attackers

276
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
and uh you would have performed a gap

277
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
analysis that will sort of help you

278
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
prioritize the resources

279
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,519
that are needed in your environment and

280
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,760
as a bonus you can use this technique

281
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,000
to value your tdr tools miter does this

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
whenever you know vendors submit the adr

283
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
tools reminder might have tested against

284
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
known thread group ttps

285
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
and you can do this in-house if you like

286
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
uh for the edr tools that are not

287
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
evaluated by miners

288
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
it will sort of give you you know your

289
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,279
own view on the edr2

290
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
phase two purple team exercise this is a

291
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
purple team summit

292
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
before us and tomorrow there are some

293
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
great in-depth talk on how to do purple

294
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,959
team exercise so we'll not

295
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
go in very much detail on how to do

296
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
perpendicular exercise

297
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,519
but what we are going to do is we'll

298
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
just take an example and walk you

299
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,519
through it on what it would look like

300
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
doing purple team exercise so what

301
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
you'll do is your detection chart you'll

302
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
pick a ttp that needs detection

303
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
uh you'll figure out what kind of iocs

304
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,000
are generated

305
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
with that dtp those iocs can be network

306
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,079
level artifact host double

307
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,000
artifact application level artifact

308
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
depending on what kind of iocs are

309
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,880
generated you will either work with a

310
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,839
network engineer

311
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,360
or a system administrator or an

312
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
application or to have those

313
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,680
artifacts logged to your sim then you

314
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
will work with the same expert to build

315
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
a sim query

316
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
you will test and review that same query

317
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
we'll talk in detail about testing and

318
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,160
reviewing the next phase testing in

319
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
phase four and reviewing

320
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,160
phase three but let's just say that the

321
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
query meets your standard for testing

322
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,640
and review

323
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
you will deploy the query and you just

324
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,240
built a detection using purple team

325
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,680
exercise

326
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
so you know let's make this more

327
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
digestible using an example and what

328
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
better example to use than dc sync

329
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
absolute worst nightmare for any company

330
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,000
and absolute

331
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
favorite attack of every red team so for

332
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,680
on-prem domain controller if you do dc

333
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,800
sync it generates

334
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
iocs at the network level and host level

335
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,959
so if we go back to this chart we have

336
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
picked a ttp that is dc sync and we have

337
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
identified ioc generated at network

338
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
level and house level

339
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,720
so now we'll work with a network

340
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,040
engineer and a domain admin to get those

341
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
ios in the sim

342
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
then we'll work with the sim expert to

343
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
build the same query to look for those

344
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,120
requests that are not coming from the

345
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
domain controller

346
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
we'll test and review that sim query and

347
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
if it meets our standard we'll deploy it

348
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,000
for detection

349
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
obviously it's never as easy as it

350
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,320
sounds there are always challenges

351
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
and we'll you know we'll talk one

352
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
challenge each for a network level

353
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,959
detection and host level detection

354
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
at network law you want to make sure

355
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,399
that all the network traffic going to dc

356
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
goes through the network device that are

357
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
responsible for sending customs

358
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,120
and at the host level whenever domain

359
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
admins would add a new dc

360
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
since you're filtering out dc's in your

361
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,959
query it might just happen that you'll

362
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
flirt your blue team with false

363
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,600
positives

364
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
so you want to make sure that you will

365
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
have a working relationship with your

366
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
system administrator team

367
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
so that whenever they deploy a new

368
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
domain controller you update your query

369
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,240
to make sure it doesn't further your

370
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,200
bluetooth

371
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
obviously depending on your environment

372
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,519
you might run into different challenges

373
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,000
and depending on the ttps uh these

374
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
challenges would change

375
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,600
but the one of the most important thing

376
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
that can come out of the purple theme is

377
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,079
that it will

378
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,440
give you a better understanding of your

379
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,279
environment and your tools

380
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
so once you're done with this phase you

381
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
would have achieved following

382
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
you would improve your detection

383
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
capabilities this is obviously a

384
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
recurring process to validate detections

385
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
none of this phases really

386
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
ever really end you know they are all

387
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
recurring you would just be visiting

388
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,320
them

389
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
at different point in time depending on

390
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,079
where you're at

391
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
and it forces your red team to improve

392
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,279
so they might they wouldn't be able to

393
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,079
use commodity

394
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
ttps anymore you know they would

395
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
probably have to use some custom dtps

396
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
and as a bonus it provides insight into

397
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,079
the value and effectiveness of the tools

398
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,040
you are using so

399
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,200
say for example in the previous example

400
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
the network device that is

401
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
ids is responsible for sending those dc

402
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
sync logs to your sim

403
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,320
and hypothetically if that ids can't see

404
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
dc sync

405
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
packets well it's time to change the

406
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,800
ideas and next time you are

407
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
evaluating the ideas you would bake that

408
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,320
into your questionnaire

409
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
and you would make sure that you are

410
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
getting the logs needed

411
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,800
to you know make sure that you get to do

412
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,079
the detections that you need

413
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,040
phase three adversary detection pipeline

414
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,440
this

415
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,680
phase can go parallel to purple team

416
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
exercise uh the main difference is

417
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
purple team exercise red teams are

418
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
heavily involved adversity detection

419
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
pipeline not so much

420
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
uh except for maybe the review phase

421
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
so uh let's let's see what the workflow

422
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,160
looks like

423
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
so again you know we in the first phase

424
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
we build the foundation

425
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,000
for our detections which was the

426
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
detection chart

427
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
the ttps that need detection would go in

428
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,360
the tickets backlog of

429
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,079
enterprise software like servicenow jira

430
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,800
then

431
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
those tickets will get assigned to a

432
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
blue team member or a blue team member

433
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,560
can pick a ttp they want to work on

434
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,279
and it will move to in progress blue

435
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
team members can look at the gdp

436
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
identify the iocs think you know come up

437
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
with the logic to detect those iocs

438
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,240
and then they'll create a query that

439
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
represents that logic

440
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
once they feel confident about the same

441
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
query they have written

442
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,199
they'll go to the review committee this

443
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,440
is the review that we talked about

444
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
in the phase 2 slide of the test and

445
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,199
review

446
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,880
uh in the next slide we'll see what

447
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,399
review committee looks like but

448
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,680
review committee if the standard are met

449
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
for the sim query they can accept it or

450
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
reject it if the query is rejected blue

451
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,839
team member can take the feedback work

452
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,279
on that feedback and come back to the

453
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,399
review committee

454
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,480
if the query is obviously accepted then

455
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639
blue team member's work is done

456
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,560
this query gets handed off to your sim

457
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,160
expert and once

458
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,399
it gets deployed to the same the sprint

459
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
is complete

460
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
so again let's make this more digestible

461
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
using an example

462
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,079
let's try attack ssh spray using this

463
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,279
detection pipeline

464
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,600
so first this you know ddb will go in

465
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,519
the ticket backlog

466
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,880
so you got a sherlock holmes on your

467
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,560
blooming right obviously the best person

468
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,079
to have in the blue on your blue team

469
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:04,720
the best

470
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
investigator ever sherlock gets assigned

471
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,320
this ticket

472
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
sherlock looks at the gdp and like yeah

473
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,079
this is easy you know it generates

474
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,760
network level i see it generates host

475
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
level ioc

476
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,959
and comes up with the logic that you see

477
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,959
on the right top side

478
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
uh network level logic multiple ssh

479
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,959
connection different destinations same

480
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,079
source ip

481
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
and host level logic multiple failed ssh

482
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
logins different usernames and same

483
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
source like me in the short period of

484
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,199
time

485
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,959
then sherlock writes a query that

486
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,880
represents this logic and sherlock is

487
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
confident so sherlock goes to the review

488
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,519
committee

489
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,199
before sherlock goes to the review

490
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
committee sherlock should have answered

491
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
in the following questions ready

492
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,120
first is there a runbook for this alert

493
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,120
so the junior analyst can follow

494
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,440
steps when that alert is triggered

495
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,160
second

496
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,759
what is the proposed maturity of this

497
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
detection experimental

498
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
or stable if it is experimental share

499
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
lock is going to work every

500
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,120
alert until it becomes stable uh

501
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
how often will it fire and what is the

502
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,560
false positive rate

503
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,720
these three questions are in our design

504
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,399
so that we don't waste our blue team's

505
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,199
time

506
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,199
or flood them with alerts and the last

507
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
two questions in my opinion are the most

508
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,880
important question and this is where

509
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,440
as a red teamer you can chime in first

510
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,959
is is there an alternate scenario which

511
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
can trigger this alert so if you

512
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,839
you know closely look at the network

513
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,880
level logic a simple nmap scan for ssh

514
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
will trigger that alert and you know

515
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,720
when it comes to

516
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
response context is very crucial so it

517
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,800
is important to know the alternate

518
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
scenario which can trigger the alert

519
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,639
and maybe modify the alert accordingly

520
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,639
too if it's an option

521
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
and the last question is there a way

522
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
this logic can be bypassed

523
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,240
you'll not find a silver bullet for

524
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
every single tdp

525
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
uh if you do that's great but in the in

526
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,120
the cases you may not

527
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
you want to be aware of them and you can

528
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
probably put some other mitigating

529
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,000
controls

530
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,360
in place uh to you know make sure that

531
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
can't be very fast

532
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
but you know once sherlock has answered

533
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,280
this question to the review committee

534
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,039
and obviously this is not the extensive

535
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,799
list of questions you can have more or

536
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,280
less questions in your review committee

537
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
so once these questions are answered if

538
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
you review committee feels like you know

539
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,319
what this query

540
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
meets our standards it'll you know

541
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,599
sherlock's work is done

542
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,079
it will be handed off to the same sme

543
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,400
and same sme templar deploys the content

544
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,839
the sprint is complete

545
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,319
voila you just turned out a detection

546
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,520
using adversaries detection pipeline

547
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,080
so at the end of this phase and again

548
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
these are all recurring phases they

549
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,720
never really end

550
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,559
uh you would have achieved following uh

551
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,320
agile content and creation process i

552
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,760
know i'm just throwing out

553
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
big words but it is indeed agile

554
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
it creates self-sufficiency for your

555
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
blue team this is very helpful

556
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
when your relative resources are limited

557
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,679
and the last

558
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
most important piece is documented trail

559
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
on how the content was created and you

560
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
know servicenow algeria

561
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
uh this is helpful when the person who

562
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,799
created the detection either left the

563
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,360
company

564
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,039
or you want to go back and update the

565
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,679
detection or you want to audit them

566
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
this document drill comes really handy

567
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
so now that you know we have sort of

568
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
become matched with it and practice the

569
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,960
basic skills

570
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,799
i'll hand it over to brad on how to do

571
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
the friendly match between writing

572
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
thanks so let's talk about the

573
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
adversarial services life cycle

574
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,919
so what you see on this slide is how we

575
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,000
envision the adversarial services life

576
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
cycle

577
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,480
end to end if you look to the left

578
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,640
we start there with the planning phase

579
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
and we finish on the right with

580
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
validating that we have both

581
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,440
robust detections and responses

582
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
we'll talk more about each of these

583
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
steps in later slides but for now

584
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
we specifically want to note that the

585
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
red team performs planning

586
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,320
and trains the blue team exercises the

587
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
detection response controls during the

588
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,039
execution

589
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,400
step and helps with the aars which is

590
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,440
really just

591
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,080
a military term you can kind of think of

592
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
it like a little bit of an improvement

593
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,400
plan

594
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,320
there's more to it than that we'll talk

595
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
about it um

596
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,280
we believe that the red team has the

597
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
opportunity to improve the security

598
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
posture

599
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,080
also in here by driving remediation for

600
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,799
all those great assessment findings

601
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,480
that came out of the execution step

602
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,160
so next slide please so let's talk a

603
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
little bit about the prerequisite

604
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
and the planning here's really um

605
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,440
a way to ensure a good red team exercise

606
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
and it'll ensure that leadership sees

607
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
the security value

608
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,880
with what the team is doing it'll keep

609
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,919
the red team

610
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
ultimately out of legal trouble and

611
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
so if you look to the left you're going

612
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
to see what we consider

613
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
the major milestones in the planning and

614
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,720
prereq phase

615
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
and on the right we'll we'll talk a

616
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,000
little bit about examples of those

617
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
so you see um the object objectives

618
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,840
defined

619
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,200
by executives or leadership um

620
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
red teaming adversarial services is

621
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,559
objective based scenario based

622
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
in that we want to determine our rules

623
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
of engagement

624
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,240
we want to run both the objectives and

625
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
our rules of engagement through our

626
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,000
legal department

627
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,799
to ensure that you know we we stay legal

628
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,120
and

629
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,159
out of trouble we want to in this phase

630
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
establish our timeline for emulating the

631
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
different phases that we're going to

632
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,120
target from

633
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,600
say attack and if we have the live

634
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,120
stream of a white cell

635
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,080
uh we're going to establish that y cell

636
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,799
that team

637
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,799
that will help mediate between red and

638
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
blue

639
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,240
if we have the luxury of a green cell a

640
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
team that maybe

641
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,159
can manage the red team infrastructure

642
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,760
during the exercise we'll go ahead and

643
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,720
establish that

644
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
team as well and one thing that we

645
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,559
really think is important

646
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
is that in this step you would deploy

647
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,159
your c2 infrastructure

648
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,039
this will ensure that um when you get

649
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,559
into execution

650
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,360
uh the actual red team engagement um

651
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,159
you're not

652
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,240
on the clock and burning lots of cycles

653
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,360
in time uh

654
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,280
try and deploy uh c2 and redirectors

655
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
all those good things and take them away

656
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,000
from your exercise minutes

657
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
so on the right side you see examples of

658
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,600
what we just talked about

659
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,760
so our objectives uh these are the

660
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,280
things that keep

661
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,679
you know your managers or your

662
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,720
leadership teams

663
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,200
up at night and things that might go

664
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,280
into that right like um

665
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,640
uh we're gonna start from the outside um

666
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
we're gonna work our way into the

667
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,159
network um

668
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,720
you know how we're to do that is um

669
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
we'll uh potentially send out uh

670
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
spearfishing but ultimately our

671
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,880
scenarios to see if we can

672
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
access intellectual property and then

673
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
we'll define like rules of engagement

674
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,520
so uh this group of employees is in

675
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,240
scope

676
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,080
and this group of employees is out of

677
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
scope and what's our target

678
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,679
network range um how would we

679
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,159
stop the engagement if we needed to and

680
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:08,720
then we'll

681
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
you know lay out a little bit of a

682
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,000
timeline so for example june

683
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,080
8th to june 14th we're going to work on

684
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
that phase of establishing

685
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,679
initial foothold this is how we'll

686
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,960
attempt to do that

687
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
15th through 21st of june we'll run

688
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,520
through persistence

689
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,480
data collection discovery uh credential

690
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,360
access

691
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,280
and we'll do that and to ensure that we

692
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,320
time box each of our scenario phases

693
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,600
and that way it'll just help protect it

694
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
that our engagement and exercise keeps

695
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,679
moving along

696
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,760
in that if we get stuck you know maybe

697
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,799
we'll use a

698
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,520
white card which we'll talk a little bit

699
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,720
about

700
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
but ultimately we don't get hung up on

701
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
one phase and

702
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,200
end up losing valuable assessments in

703
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
other phases

704
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,120
so this just keeps it moving along so

705
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
next slide please

706
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,400
so we'll talk a little bit about the

707
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,720
execution and the aars

708
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
in our execution phase again on the left

709
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
side these are the things we think

710
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
very critical uh we want to strictly

711
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
follow the rules of engagement that

712
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,480
we've

713
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
uh had signed off on and have agreement

714
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,679
to

715
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,919
um one thing is really critical we did

716
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,440
not want to obstruct

717
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
the blue team's ability to investigate

718
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,880
for example let's say

719
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
you know red team decides to turn off

720
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
edr tools

721
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,400
you know if the blue team can't

722
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
investigate it just defeats the whole

723
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
purpose of the exercise

724
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,039
really reduces you know the value of it

725
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,080
so we don't want to do anything that

726
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,760
would blind the blue team

727
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,039
now if uh red team's operating

728
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,960
it doesn't get caught easily maybe we

729
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,159
want to increase

730
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,279
the level of noise so blue team can

731
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,559
find some iocs to hunt by

732
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,799
look for the red team right because

733
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,640
that's what we want for a good exercise

734
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,200
so

735
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,279
red team isn't getting caught what can

736
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,559
red team do

737
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,400
to ensure that blue team is getting that

738
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,679
value in

739
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,799
walking through those steps and of

740
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,520
course

741
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,279
if the red team gets stuck in a certain

742
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,960
phase and just can't complete it

743
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,279
you know we don't want to keep just

744
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,559
banging on

745
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,400
that phase you know why cart it document

746
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
it in your

747
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
findings report uh just make sure you

748
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,200
mention it there

749
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,400
um and move on uh there might be

750
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,000
different reasons why

751
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
uh you need to white card a certain

752
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,440
phase but again

753
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,360
keep the exercise moving then on the

754
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
right side you see

755
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,000
just effective aars after action

756
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,279
reviews again kind of like

757
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,520
an improvement plan but there's more to

758
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,200
it than that so we talk about the major

759
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
sections that we want to include

760
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,039
so what went well what didn't go well

761
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,480
what can be improved

762
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,799
and how do we plan for future success

763
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,480
for everybody involved

764
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,720
so you see there just as an example of

765
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,600
what went well

766
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,799
for the red team the redirector

767
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,600
directors located near headquarters

768
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,360
obfuscated our infrastructure

769
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,600
and made it more challenging for blue

770
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,559
and on

771
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,200
the blue side blue team correctly

772
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,960
identified red team smb

773
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,919
password spray of a compromised account

774
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,400
in

775
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,760
host there's a blue team win

776
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,200
so these are basic examples

777
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
but we really want to show you know how

778
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,039
these can be used effectively

779
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,279
and you're documenting what comes out of

780
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,080
these

781
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,159
exercises so that it's not lost and you

782
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,159
can show value back to

783
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
your leadership and the team it's all

784
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,240
collected here

785
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,360
next slide please so let's talk a little

786
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,799
bit about remediation

787
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,960
um here's another great place that red

788
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
team can provide value

789
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,520
remediation is hard most people don't

790
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
want to do remediation

791
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,559
but the red team can ensure that

792
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,320
remediation efforts improve

793
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
the overall security posture and that

794
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
those improvements

795
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,159
really add to attack or pain which is

796
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,400
something that the red team

797
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,480
maybe knows better than any other

798
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,679
security function

799
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
a function attack attack or pain so

800
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,679
we'll talk a little bit about

801
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,640
remediation

802
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
we tend to break these down into two

803
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
major groups

804
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
so you think about prevention and

805
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,760
detection and response

806
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,520
prevention anything that really denies

807
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,240
degrades disrupts the attacker's tactics

808
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
costing them time and stealth

809
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,200
so couple examples there right mfa

810
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
great preventative control network

811
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,320
segmentation

812
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,440
definitely best practice if you

813
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,840
increase your password complexity or

814
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,039
make stronger

815
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,000
passwords harder for the attackers to

816
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,360
crack those hashes

817
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,440
right and then in terms of detection

818
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,520
response this is really anything

819
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,520
that involves collection the monitoring

820
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
for bypass and of those preventative

821
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,799
controls

822
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,360
as well as things that maybe we just

823
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,480
can't prevent

824
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
but we need to be able to detect and

825
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,159
respond so take for example

826
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,480
otto was talking about dc sync not a

827
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
really good way out there to

828
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,520
necessarily prevent this but we can

829
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
detect it

830
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,799
and we can have a robust response when

831
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,880
that detection fires

832
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
mfa bypass mfa no doubts really good

833
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,679
security control

834
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
but we all know that there are bypasses

835
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:22,799
out there for

836
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,720
mfa and then living off the land

837
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,520
um you know attackers abusing legitimate

838
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,240
accounts

839
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,039
maybe those accounts are admin accounts

840
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:33,600
so

841
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
this is normal activity harder to

842
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,279
find but we won't be able to detect and

843
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,240
respond

844
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,320
if this occurs so

845
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,039
now here looking at our workflow we're

846
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:47,520
looking

847
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
a little bit more at the rise side this

848
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,880
time

849
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,679
now in in our workflow steps uh you're

850
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,279
really seeing from remediation to

851
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,320
validation

852
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,880
and we'll be taking our ttps used in the

853
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,440
red team

854
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,960
exercise during that execution step

855
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
those will be the basis of our unit test

856
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
to build new or better detections

857
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,240
now uh whether our ttps are mapped

858
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
easily to minor attack

859
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,640
or let's say that they're custom it

860
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,240
doesn't really matter our purple team

861
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,520
exercises

862
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,919
and detection pipeline processes still

863
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,120
work for building

864
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,919
and testing the detection from either uh

865
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,799
place that those

866
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,039
might come from so during our unit test

867
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,039
that you see there

868
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,840
the unit test for detection part we will

869
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,000
rerun the ttps

870
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,480
using our red team engagement to

871
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,840
ultimately validate

872
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,200
that our alerts fire or trigger

873
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,520
now once we have high fidelity

874
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
detections

875
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,399
we will do a blind test another place

876
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,640
where red team comes back in

877
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,480
specifically using those ttps again

878
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
to validate that we have adequate

879
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,919
response

880
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,200
and so last but not least um

881
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,399
you can show progress and value uh by

882
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,000
recording the difference

883
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,039
uh save with mean time to detect

884
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,000
or mean time to respond um during the

885
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
engagement right

886
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,799
and how those metrics improve

887
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,159
at the end so for example um

888
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
you collected uh collect those times

889
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,520
during your remediation

890
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,799
or the operation maybe

891
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,039
no alert was triggered when the red team

892
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,240
was actually

893
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
uh doing the engagement but now

894
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,720
um you've built the detections uh

895
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
you've tested and validated for response

896
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
so let's say now

897
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,200
you've gone from not detecting this ttp

898
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,760
at all

899
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,919
to now you've detected and responded

900
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,039
within nine minutes

901
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,559
it's gonna be very hard to say that the

902
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,559
team's not improving when you can show

903
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,360
metrics

904
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,799
and numbers like that so next slide

905
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,679
please

906
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,000
so uh our adversarial services life

907
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,279
cycle in the end

908
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,600
it provides us feedback on the all that

909
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,480
great work

910
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
uh completed during uh phase one two and

911
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,799
three that we talked about

912
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,320
it trains our blue team to engage track

913
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,679
and hunt for actual adversaries

914
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,640
and the remediation phase ensures

915
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,679
improvements

916
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,240
in those critical controls and our

917
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,960
posture

918
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,679
and of course strong prevention and

919
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,720
detections

920
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
are really the foundation of a strong

921
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
response

922
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,600
so in closing we believe this

923
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,399
methodology

924
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,240
will help you train the blue team to

925
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,760
proactively hunt

926
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,440
for example take um whatever exploit is

927
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,240
released

928
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,480
say for a zero day uh blue team will

929
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
have a methodology to proactively hunt

930
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,120
with oi iocs from uh the zero day

931
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
and build detections from the iocs and

932
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,399
that could go for

933
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,559
any zero day or vulnerability exploit

934
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,320
and of course all phases that we've

935
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,960
talked about are methodically linked

936
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,640
motto talked about that they are

937
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
recurring and provide for continuous

938
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,720
security posture especially

939
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
in areas of detection and response

940
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,760
for our improvement and

941
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,679
last this really builds transparency

942
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,960
and provides it to your management and

943
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,320
your leadership

944
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,200
uh in your security organization so in

945
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,120
the things that we've talked about

946
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,559
you're going to be able to show them

947
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,279
your current posture you're going to be

948
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:35,760
able to give

949
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,279
a much clearer bigger picture

950
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
you're going to be able to talk and

951
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,320
demonstrate in terms of security value

952
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,760
to them helping them understand um

953
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,000
where budget is being spent and the

954
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,080
value of the investments

955
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
and ultimately all of this is going to

956
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,679
be supported with the things that we've

957
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:56,559
talked about

958
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,440
uh you're going to have more metrics

959
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
you're gonna have

960
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,640
documentation um the aars

961
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
uh you're gonna have increased

962
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,880
communication and alignment because of

963
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,919
these things

964
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,360
and ultimately you're gonna have you

965
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
know your red team reporting and and

966
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,559
all the reporting that comes out of this

967
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,760
and they're going to be able to see that

968
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,279
right they're going to know

969
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,799
um exactly what the teams are doing how

970
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,240
the teams are improving

971
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,279
and what uh value is being returned

972
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,320
in uh next slide and

973
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,679
and so uh with that um we'd like to give

974
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,200
a big thanks to sans

975
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,519
uh and everyone for attending our talk

976
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,200
we really appreciate it

977
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
uh and thanks for listening to us

978
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,960
thank you all so much that was great

979
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,640
what a great way to wrap

980
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,399
up our day one uh the most

981
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,159
asked question what is a aar

982
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,679
so um the after action report you know

983
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,519
non-military folks did not know but

984
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,760
don't worry we answered that question

985
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,880
on the slack uh for you uh

986
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,240
which begs to ask did uh you have some

987
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
military background that's why you use

988
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,799
that or it was just

989
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,440
inherited through uh commercial work

990
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,919
like it was for me

991
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,360
um that's a great question uh i'll let

992
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,519
motto give his answer but i'll just say

993
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,720
first from my background um

994
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
my experience with the aar i had the

995
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
opportunity a couple years ago to attend

996
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,320
a

997
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,760
military national guard event

998
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,080
known as cybershield where i got to be

999
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,519
on the red team there

1000
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,919
uh and that was probably my introduction

1001
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,440
to aar and it's a

1002
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,640
it's um it's an awesome tool to collect

1003
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
uh all the information that comes out of

1004
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,720
these exercises yep and i had the

1005
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,480
opportunity to attend cyber shield in a

1006
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,279
different year

1007
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,840
where i learned this term um if you get

1008
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,960
if you ever have an opportunity to

1009
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,240
attend cyber shield i would highly

1010
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,200
recommend it

1011
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,440
that's awesome yeah no i figured i also

1012
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
learned it uh when i

1013
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,159
actually came over and started working

1014
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,239
at scythe with with bryson bort

1015
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,119
uh who introduced me to that term so uh

1016
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,000
it was just funny

1017
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
