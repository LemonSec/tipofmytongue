1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,520
uh

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,240
we have uh two people uh to introduce uh

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,800
both directors at capital one um

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
we have carrie who is the director of

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
tread hunting and david the director of

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
security chaos engineering which sounds

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
like a very interesting job title um

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,840
david even and i'm going to share a

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,279
small secret david

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,039
shared in the instructor channel the

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,880
secret one that he even got dressed for

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,359
this presentation so i'm very excited

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
i'm i'm very impressed so i'm very

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,800
honored as well

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,680
so without further ado um kick it off

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,239
and i'm

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
looking forward to this one thanks

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,239
so thank you and i want to open this up

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,520
with an apology

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,160
so i'm known for making some of the most

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,960
achingly

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
painful boring slide decks around

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
and when people would feel physical pain

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
when they see my decks so i was issued a

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,239
challenge and the challenge was to be

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,879
funnier or use amusing graphics or

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,480
references to doctor who

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
i was going to try that but i don't

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
really like dc comic book hero movies so

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
this is what you get

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
i'm sorry so that is me

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,280
i do security chaos engineering i'm on

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,759
the left

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,320
i the the best thing from here is

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
actually starting the end

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
indoor snowball fight in las vegas that

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
was in 2007

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
i grabbed some snow i took it inside and

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
i hit my boss with a snowball

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,520
that is pretty much the most exciting

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,560
thing that i've ever done

42
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
in my entire life

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
alright guys um hi i'm carrie i

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,439
am the uh lead threat huntress at

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,799
capital one

46
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,360
um i have kind of i guess a diverse

47
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,840
background in security um

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,119
but you know started off at georgia tech

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,960
and international affairs continued at

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,159
georgia tech

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,119
for my master's in computer science and

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,960
i love talking about anything related to

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
threat intelligence

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,439
and russian language cultural politics

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,719
or cyber security

56
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,840
cyber security policy is also awesome

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
so

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,560
um so today we're going to talk to you

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
guys about

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,400
threat hunting and how we can use

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
security chaos engineering outputs in

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
order to create

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,319
a hunt hypothesis so we're going to kind

64
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,680
of set the stage

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
explain kind of why hunt creating

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,319
hypotheses can be kind of challenging

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
and some of the things to consider when

68
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,879
you're doing it

69
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
david's going to give us an overview of

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
security chaos engineering and what it

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,440
is and

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
what you know how he does what he does

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
we'll talk about the kind of data that

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
we get from

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
a security chaos engineering test and

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
then also walk through how to apply that

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
to a hunt

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
so first i wanted to kind of start us

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,400
off by talking about what makes a good

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
hunt hypothesis

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
um and this is kind of i i kind of think

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,959
about it in terms of like the real world

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,959
and then the ideal world

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,560
now the scale between like you know the

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
transition between real world and ideal

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:14,640
world

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
ideal is relative to everybody it's

88
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
different for everybody and it's

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
different in every organization you're

90
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,519
going to be in

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
but what i typically find is that when

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,640
we're doing

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,319
um initiating a threat hunt um

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,599
there are a couple things that kind of

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,519
themes that typically come

96
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
out of these very commonly um and so

97
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,159
most of the time it's really kind of a

98
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
little bit more of an art than it is a

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:39,760
science right

100
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,519
some of the times like sometimes it's

101
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,360
just an analyst was reading an article

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,959
and got curious and that's awesome

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,000
because curiosity

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
is a cornerstone of threat hunting so

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
that is super great when that works out

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,360
um some of the other ones i get are an

107
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,000
executive

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,319
read a news article and got curious um

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,319
which is a little bit like

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
it's not quite um the time you want to

111
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,080
be hunting necessarily but it's

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,439
something that actually comes up

113
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,400
pretty frequently that in my experience

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,360
um

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
you know sometimes i don't know how many

116
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
people have had this experience

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,000
themselves but

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
i have certainly been just kind of

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
goofing around in the logs

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,720
and stumbled across something and then

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
pretended like retroactively that i was

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
looking for that thing all along

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,919
um so you know definitely not saying

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,120
that that's happened but it's totally

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,080
happened

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
um and then some of the other things too

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
where you know sometimes you get

128
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
data from like an incident response

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
investigation or

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
sometimes you just have a hunch um or

131
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
you know you shook a magic eight ball

132
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,240
and this

133
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
that's what came out right um but in the

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,759
ideal world like as you start to kind of

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,800
have to mature your program beyond

136
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
that kind of um curiosity-based or kind

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
of

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,600
intuition-based hunting um there are

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
kind of a couple things that

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
that typically you want to kind of

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
maximize for your

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,080
hunt high pot when you're creating your

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
hunt hypothesis so

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,759
the first is that you want to maximize

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
your chances of actually finding a

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
threat actor

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
and again that's specific to your

148
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,320
environment

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
and what's specific to you know your

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
organization your

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
your environment all that kind of stuff

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
um but what you know you want to make

153
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,639
sure that you're kind of setting

154
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,600
yourself up

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
for success as much as possible to find

156
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
a threat actor

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,800
and then related to that is you also

158
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
want to make sure that your hypothesis

159
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,639
is in some ways broad enough that even

160
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,639
if that threat actor isn't active the

161
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,240
thing you're looking for isn't present

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
in your environment

163
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
you're still likely to find something

164
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
those like secondary benefits that come

165
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
out of hunting whether it's

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
gaps and logging invisibility or you

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,639
know

168
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
those kind of something interesting bad

169
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,479
security practices that happen in the

170
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,919
organization something that would kind

171
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
of help

172
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
ensure that you have those secondary

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,520
benefits to show

174
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,560
at the end of a hunt operation um

175
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,080
and then you also want to make sure that

176
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
it's narrow enough

177
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,160
um so that when you have results you

178
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,759
know how to interpret them and you know

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,280
what you're looking at

180
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
so the the kind of the canonical example

181
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
that i i like to use and

182
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,160
i'll use here throughout this

183
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
presentation is um

184
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
uh actors performing commanding control

185
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
over web protocols

186
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,560
um we all know this this checks all

187
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,479
those three boxes right we all know that

188
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,000
actors

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
in the majority of cases have to perform

190
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,680
some kind of commanded control

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
and commanding control over http or

192
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,199
https

193
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,720
is um more and more common

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
because it works right um the other

195
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,039
thing too is we know

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
you know if we kind of expand that out

197
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,080
you know you've got

198
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
your hypothesis and then your detection

199
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,120
strategy

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
how you're going to look for that um

201
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,479
so in this case right like i've see i

202
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,680
can't tell you how many times i've seen

203
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,039
somebody say oh easy we'll look for

204
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,000
beaconing

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,039
um myself included and so what you find

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,400
when you do

207
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
that is um everything begins right it's

208
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,160
not just malware

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
um lots and lots and lots of things

210
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,680
begin um but it kind of raises the

211
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
question as you're looking for that data

212
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
and seeing all these things that are

213
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,919
beginning it kind of raises this

214
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,639
question of like

215
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,759
should all these things actually be

216
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,720
beginning you know is is that normal or

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
appropriate for our environment so it

218
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
you end up learning a lot about your

219
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,360
environment just

220
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,440
from from the act of hunting and that's

221
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
always like a secondary benefit that you

222
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,319
want to you want to get

223
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
and then um finally you know checking

224
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
that third box by narrowing down the

225
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,000
beginning

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,599
you bound your results so you know what

227
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,039
you're looking for and you know kind of

228
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,560
how to interpret the things that you

229
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,000
find

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
um but that's not kind of that's not all

231
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
of it right um

232
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
for anybody who's ever tried this you

233
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
know that like

234
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
there are so many different things that

235
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
actors can do to kind of

236
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,120
impact how you hunt or how effective

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
your detection strategy is

238
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
for detecting beginning and so you know

239
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,520
that can be by manipulating like the

240
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
domain to make it look like a false

241
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,319
positive

242
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,120
um using something like domain fronting

243
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,319
or using jitter

244
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,960
to affect how your beaconing detection

245
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
works in practice right and whether it

246
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,120
texts or not

247
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
so these are all things that you have to

248
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,400
kind of think about or kind of tailor

249
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
like in practice when you actually go to

250
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
to execute your hunt you have to kind of

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
figure out what am i going to account

252
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,199
for

253
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
as part of this hunt and what am i not

254
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
going to account for

255
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,000
so going back to this this first slide

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,560
right

257
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,280
to move things um even further from art

258
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
into science there are three additional

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,839
things that

260
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,479
um i typically like to layer on when i'm

261
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
thinking about

262
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
um a hypothesis and so the first is that

263
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
you really want to cater your hunt

264
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,399
to where you know that you have logging

265
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
and visibility because if you don't have

266
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
logging or you don't have visibility

267
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
you're kind of setting yourself up for

268
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,880
failure from the start right so you want

269
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
to make sure that you have logging

270
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,160
um and then the second piece is you want

271
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,200
to

272
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,959
hunt where you don't already have

273
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
preventative controls because if you're

274
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
already preventing it you don't have to

275
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,560
you know you don't necessarily have to

276
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
have a human going out and proactively

277
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
looking for it

278
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
um and same with detective right like if

279
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
it's already being detected in your

280
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
environment it's probably going through

281
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,880
a different pipeline for triage and

282
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,519
analysis

283
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,839
so again it's not necessarily the place

284
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,880
that you want to read

285
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
to direct your hunting resources

286
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
so that raises the question how do you

287
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,880
find these gaps in the first place and

288
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,240
that's an excellent question that

289
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
lavezza is going to answer

290
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
now i'm so glad that i have the answer

291
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
totally off the top of my head

292
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,080
and the answer is a question the

293
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
question is

294
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,399
what is security chaos engineering

295
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,320
so as a side note i look at this whole

296
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
process a little bit differently

297
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
rather than focusing on detection and

298
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,240
adversarial simulation

299
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
i'm taking a step back and looking for

300
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
the

301
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
performance of the tooling itself as it

302
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,279
exists in real life

303
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,360
so detecting adversaries isn't really

304
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,959
what i'm concerned about i'm

305
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,800
concerned about the observability

306
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
measurement and repeatability of what

307
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,519
we're doing

308
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
if it detects great if it doesn't great

309
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,160
what matters is that we're establishing

310
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
the baseline something to build the rest

311
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,440
of the program off of

312
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
so i want to know when things change

313
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
over time if the tooling that we're

314
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
that is responsible for driving

315
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,279
detection strays from the expected

316
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,160
results

317
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
so the the chaos and security chaos

318
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,600
engineering

319
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,519
isn't the experimentation being

320
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,720
performed it's the

321
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
bau the business as usual work that

322
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,399
happens every day

323
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,800
so it's not about breaking things it's

324
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
about fixing things

325
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,720
so like attacking like that sounds like

326
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,079
it's a red team it's like well

327
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,000
in some cases it can be so we're taking

328
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,519
attacks that you see in real life and

329
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,959
applying it to your own environment

330
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,320
in order to understand what your

331
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,000
defenses actually look like

332
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
but these outputs isn't that purple

333
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
well yeah maybe but i'm still not really

334
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,800
concerned about

335
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
the detection coverage the focus is

336
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
going a bit higher so looking at the

337
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
tooling itself that allows the

338
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
detections to manifest

339
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,680
themselves and really help out the teams

340
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,279
who are dedicated to doing the

341
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,920
actual hard work the defensive the

342
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,480
defense in the enterprise

343
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,760
but yes it is blue but

344
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
they've got enough problems to worry

345
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,360
about so the focal point is helping

346
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,079
answer the question

347
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
of are these critical alerts quiet

348
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
because we're not being attacked or

349
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,440
maybe

350
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,120
or is it because the alert is broken

351
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,200
so we get back to here i actually did

352
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
this myself

353
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,800
so i feel like i'm pretty talented

354
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
so building off of the traditional chaos

355
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
engineering you will start with a

356
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
hypothesis of

357
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,959
what do you think will happen are you

358
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,360
correct what you find at this stage is

359
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
where you really start building the

360
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
baseline of what you can prove

361
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,320
and again i'm not really concerned about

362
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,079
detecting threat actor techniques that

363
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,360
have been reused across

364
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,600
thousands of times because security is

365
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,639
fundamentally broken

366
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
but i'm concerned with the gaps that are

367
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
there due to deficiencies

368
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
and we discover these deficiencies

369
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
through experimentation so

370
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
typically you'd use framework of some

371
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,639
sort that everyone's going to be

372
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,519
familiar with

373
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
atomic red team scythe prelude caldera

374
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
or one of the half a million vendors

375
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
trying to bum rush the space

376
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
so then we do it so if this technique

377
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,320
was performed

378
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
do we see it where do we see it we're

379
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
looking for defense and depth and

380
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,360
detection and depth we want to be able

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,839
to

382
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,440
prove with data that the defensive

383
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,959
strategy that's been designed

384
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,959
actually works so the experiments

385
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,800
launched so when the first time you do

386
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,120
it

387
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
whatever the results are this is good or

388
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,800
bad it's going to be the baseline

389
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
if you've never done this this is really

390
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,959
really really time consuming

391
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,519
so identifying baseline behavior is

392
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,120
pretty much the most difficult part of

393
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
the entire process

394
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
so once you get to there it is

395
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
repeat forever

396
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,040
automation is really the only way to

397
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,399
stay sane because

398
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,920
if you don't automate you are going to

399
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
lose your mind from data analysis

400
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,200
i have done that carrie can attest

401
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
so let your mind rest at this stage so

402
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,200
like you would run a weekly

403
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
daily whatever a goal is to ensure that

404
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
the changes

405
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,519
are identified early on before cascading

406
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
failure can happen so it's kind of like

407
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,279
it's kind of like eating soup you don't

408
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
just smash your face into the bowl

409
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
and hope for the best like you're gonna

410
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
test a small portion of it to make sure

411
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,399
it's the right temperature it's the

412
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,240
actual soup that you ordered or

413
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,920
maybe you don't i don't i'm not going to

414
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
judge people for how they eat

415
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,160
so the goal is to understand

416
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,760
how these tools work together if they're

417
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
functioning and expected

418
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,519
as you experiment and identify the

419
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,519
deviations this drives the engineering

420
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
teams to improve the platform which

421
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,320
feeds detection

422
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,480
it tells everybody where gaps exist

423
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
automation's required because you do it

424
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
forever

425
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
because failure is the normal condition

426
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,760
and there will always be gaps in

427
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,560
understanding

428
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,199
and how do these gaps happen they happen

429
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,639
through regular work

430
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,480
so despite the name security chaos

431
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
engineering doesn't generate the chaos

432
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,279
it comes from the

433
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,360
tuning the updating the lack of updating

434
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
the regular work

435
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,680
that people do every day so we're here

436
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,639
to help fix

437
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,560
and the gaps typically start small like

438
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
little temporary fixes as a compensating

439
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
control that turns permanent

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
stop gap solution things like that you

441
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,040
know something

442
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
to fix later that never gets fixed and

443
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,800
then years later

444
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,240
because teams have so much to do and

445
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
there's so few people you have

446
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
considerations

447
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,199
you get competing priorities you make

448
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,040
changes in response to audits changes

449
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
required to check the compliance box

450
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,320
team reorg strategy changes duplicative

451
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,880

expired certs or

454
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,040
me trying to do work so many of the

455
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
problems that we see

456
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
aren't from advanced attackers it's

457
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,000
organizations struggling to keep

458
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,959
up with their complex environments so

459
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
now that we identify gaps in our layers

460
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,440
defense

461
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
what do you do next

462
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
so here we start with a hypothesis that

463
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
we mentioned earlier

464
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
so you start building on your concerns

465
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
if x happened to us

466
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
would we see it what what tools do we

467
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,959
have that

468
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,040
provide the visibility of an actor doing

469
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
why and does that tooling actually work

470
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,120
this is where in my opinion the

471
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
difference between detection pipelines

472
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,440
in purple

473
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
and security ks engineering start to

474
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
grow so in the example here we expect to

475
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,160
see

476
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,680
uac abuse account discovery c2 interpret

477
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,320
inter interpretive dance lateral

478
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,519
movement and more but

479
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
do we like do we see events for

480
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
application control do we see the proxy

481
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
events firewall events

482
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
uh events forward logging if we do great

483
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,000
if we don't

484
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
then we know where we have holes in our

485
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,519
understanding so

486
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
the big key to all of this is automation

487
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,399
so testing at this one time never gives

488
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,920
a complete picture of how your systems

489
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
perform over time and it needs to be

490
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,120
done regularly in order to catch

491
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,560
deviations before they're taken

492
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
advantage of because you can't really

493
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
map and measure threats if you don't

494
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,120
have the necessary data

495
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,600
awesome so in practice what this looks

496
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,560
like

497
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
um you need a couple things before you

498
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
start hunting

499
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,800
um to make this work so the first is is

500
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,360
to understand your network architecture

501
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
and so really what you want to just

502
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
understand is where

503
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
where do all of your detection or

504
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
detective and preventative controls

505
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,560
sit relative to one another because

506
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
it'll help you understand how to

507
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
interpret

508
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
the testing that that that your

509
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,839
security cast engineering team is doing

510
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,199
and then the other thing is the list of

511
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
automated testing and so i have a couple

512
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
of toy examples here

513
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
um that are are similar to what you

514
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,480
would get

515
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,079
like something david would produce for

516
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,480
me right um

517
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,399
and what this really is is just the list

518
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
of of all the tests

519
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
that um your chaos engineering team has

520
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,560
run

521
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,680
um and the results that come out of that

522
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,560
right

523
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
and so in this case we're kind of

524
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,160
focusing on variations of c2

525
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
so the first thing to that we want to

526
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,000
get from this is understanding where we

527
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
have logging where we don't

528
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,599
and so again this is a toy example but

529
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,880
this is actually

530
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
exactly how we produce the data like how

531
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
we basically take the data out and and

532
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,400
analyze it

533
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
when we're we're setting up for a hunt

534
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,839
so

535
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
what i have here is a heat map that

536
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,000
shows basically our logging rates over

537
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,240
the course of five months and so what

538
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
you want to do is you want to

539
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,360
kind of start off by saying okay where

540
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
do i know that i have logging

541
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,679
um and so we're super lucky in our in

542
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,559
our environment

543
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,760
our hypothetical environment um we have

544
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,640
100

545
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
visibility we log every single time that

546
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
david has produced a test

547
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
we've logged it um so we have logging

548
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,640
there it's not yet signal

549
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,400
it's not yet something that like an

550
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
analyst would necessarily have already

551
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,679
looked at but we know that logging

552
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
like the visibility that we need is

553
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
there the one exception to that in our

554
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,200
hypothetical environment is

555
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
ssl let's say hypothetically we didn't

556
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
have any kind of ssl

557
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
interception and so we were for the

558
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,679
first part of the

559
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
year kind of blind to anything that was

560
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,320
happening over

561
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,760
https so then the second thing that we

562
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,480
want to see

563
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,520
is um prevention right and so

564
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
ideally like i said before we want to be

565
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,640
hunting in air

566
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
in an area where we don't have we don't

567
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,840
already have good prevention

568
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,240
and so if for example we know that we're

569
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,520
always detecting

570
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,840
um payload downloads when they're over

571
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,720
hdp

572
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
because we have really good um with

573
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,799
really good prevention for that

574
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,000
um then we wouldn't uh

575
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
we wouldn't necessarily want to be

576
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
hunting for that and so

577
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
in this example right um you know what

578
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,080
we're what this data is telling

579
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,720
us is we actually don't have very good

580
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,600
prevention

581
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,280
um you know our preventative controls

582
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
are struggling to

583
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,960
block c2

584
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
to result domains and

585
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
so uh so if the domain has like history

586
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,120
right it's hard for us or it's hard for

587
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,360
our preventative controls

588
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
and then um the other thing too that

589
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
we're seeing here is that again

590
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,520
right as we implemented um

591
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
ssl interception right all of a sudden

592
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
our prevention rates went up

593
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,880
um and so that's really awesome that can

594
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
tell us as a hunter or me as a huntress

595
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,960
like

596
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
you know when i should or shouldn't go

597
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,320
and look

598
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,919
um in https data

599
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,280
and then we also saw something

600
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
interesting here which is another um

601
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,720
kind of thing that's really relevant

602
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,320
when you're getting ready to set up for

603
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,360
a hunt

604
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,039
um we see that in april and may we saw a

605
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,679
drop off in our prevention rates for

606
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,600
um c2 when there are known bad

607
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
hard-coded user agents

608
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,679
and so we don't yet know why that is

609
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,880
like what

610
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
what happened but we know that there's

611
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,840
something that we need to go and dig in

612
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,799
there

613
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,919
and maybe provide um potentially provide

614
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,400
like a

615
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
you know compensating control until we

616
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,080
get that

617
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,039
back to working so when you go next

618
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,280
slide

619
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
so then the final thing is detection

620
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,559
rates

621
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,480
and so this is where kind of we're gonna

622
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
like bring it all together in the next

623
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,520
slide but

624
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,360
um what we're seeing here is that we

625
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
actually have um

626
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,120
you know we have some alerting

627
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
when we're going to um

628
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
resold domains right or when we're

629
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
seeing tracy 2 to result domains we have

630
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
some alerting for that but it's spotty

631
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,159
it's not always like 100

632
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,520
thing we're not detecting 100 of it

633
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
and so um and so that tells us like

634
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
tells me as a hunter as a huntress right

635
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,600
um basically you know

636
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,520
i know that that in the majority of

637
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
cases in this in this example

638
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,840
um alerting is going to a human analyst

639
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,799
to look at

640
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
um is being detected like there is

641
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,640
signal that somebody can go and look at

642
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,480
and so i can assume that those things

643
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,960
are being triaged through a different

644
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,559
you know different pipeline through our

645
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,280
csoc something like that right

646
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,280
um but i know that there there is a gap

647
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,480
in this result domains um kind of area

648
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,320
and so um so we put that all together

649
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,120
right

650
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,400
um we now know in our in our like

651
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
based on our kind of high level hunt

652
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
hypothesis and our detection strategy

653
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,640
what do we need to really account for

654
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,000
and what what can we kind of

655
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,480
pass over when we're doing our when

656
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
we're constructing our

657
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
our actual like analytic to detect this

658
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,760
um we know that we don't have to account

659
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,840
for payload downloads because

660
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,679
we're good um it's detected it's

661
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
prevented we're good

662
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,799
um we probably shouldn't do a historical

663
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,280
search

664
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,880
in https communications https logs

665
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,240
because

666
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,080
we just don't have the logs to support

667
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,720
them historically

668
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
we also know that um

669
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,280
as hunters we uh shouldn't focus on like

670
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,520
um you may have skipped over this but

671
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,799
you know there were a couple of tests

672
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
around dynamic dns or

673
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,200
c2 directly to ip addresses kind of

674
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
bypassing dns altogether

675
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
and in this situation we know that we

676
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
have effective detection and prevention

677
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
so we're good we can skip over that as

678
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,200
well

679
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
and we should really focus on the result

680
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
domains kind of

681
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,640
angle so that's just one way that we

682
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,159
the heat map and that kind of approach

683
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,640
is one way that we we use this data

684
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
um when we're constructing hunts but

685
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,080
there's a lot of different ways that you

686
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,600
can slice and dice this to make it

687
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
really meaningful depending on the use

688
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,000
case

689
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,520
that you have right um we can absolutely

690
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
we can and do measure this use this to

691
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,880
measure our effect

692
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,840
our effectiveness over whatever

693
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
framework of choice you have

694
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,120
right so miter attack is

695
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,960
great that's what we use but you can use

696
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,080
it again you know whatever you want

697
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,440
um then the other thing is

698
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
uh we you know you can also use this

699
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,159
like as a hunter right

700
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,640
to to get a sense of where we are

701
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,039
leaning really heavily in terms of

702
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
um logging detection prevention etc and

703
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
so you can say you know oh

704
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
well you know our proxy logs are really

705
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,480
really important or our

706
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,000
windows event logs are really like

707
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,520
there's a lot of there's a lot of data

708
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,039
in there for us to go and look at so it

709
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,720
can give you a sense of where you can

710
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
lean which data sources you can lean on

711
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,760
more heavily

712
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,880
versus not and then

713
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,919
um also tracking progress over time

714
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,240
right like ideally you want to be able

715
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
to map

716
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,880
um benefits coming out of your hunts

717
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
those secondary benefits increase

718
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,279
prevention

719
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,520
increase detection et cetera you want to

720
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
be able to map that and so this gives

721
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,799
you actually a way to

722
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
to kind of start to track that over time

723
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
and to show

724
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
that um like you're helping to support

725
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,559
growing your

726
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,120
organization's defensive capabilities

727
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
over time

728
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,000
um and then the last thing right the

729
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,360
last example would be

730
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,080
um using this to actually you know kind

731
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,159
of slicing it according to

732
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,880
malware types or to thread actors so

733
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
that when you do have a question about

734
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,360
you know um how protected are we against

735
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,240
ransomware

736
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,159
um you know you have an answer you you

737
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,679
have a way to kind of

738
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,880
one to say well you know we see either

739
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,159
these are you know our rates are good or

740
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,120
bad

741
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,440
um and then as a hunt like as a hunter

742
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,320
as huntress

743
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,080
um i would go through this to say

744
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
um you know well this is actually you

745
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
know if you want me to go hunt for

746
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,480
ransomware i'm going to hunt for these

747
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,039
families

748
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,360
or something something along those lines

749
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,799
so the benefits of doing all this is

750
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,400
basically to understand

751
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,159
how everything works in your production

752
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,840
environment because you always

753
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
always work in production don't let

754
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
anyone tell you different it's the

755
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,559
best practice somewhere it validates

756
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,760
that your controls are actually

757
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,559
effective

758
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
and it importantly it gives your

759
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,400
leadership

760
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
an idea of what the return on the

761
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
investment of security is because

762
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
security is really really expensive and

763
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,400
not everybody's got tremendous budgets

764
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
so knowing that your tooling works

765
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,520
knowing that the stuff that they

766
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,960
invest in is actually working helps

767
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,799
generate the buying needed to fund the

768
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,240
position that you're already in or the

769
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,440
one that you're proposed

770
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,000
of doing it helps measure the maturity

771
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,279
of your program it gives you

772
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,840
defensive metrics and makes you

773
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,400
enthusiastic

774
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,039
about hunting

775
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:10,320
and that is it
