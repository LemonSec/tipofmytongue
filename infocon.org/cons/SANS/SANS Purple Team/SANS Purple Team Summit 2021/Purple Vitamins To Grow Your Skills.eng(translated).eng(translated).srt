ifpi  using computer follow for quite

48
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:59,600
some time

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,030
actually this teenager starts in the

50
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,340
early eighties and he starts it with an

51
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,590
apple to computer and them and juicy here in

52
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,960
the slides and

53
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,390
it's not like well we have this apple die

very very open i solidarity by the apple

57
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,970
one computer was it something you have

an image yourself and this is an apple

59
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,340
access and the reason ai selected is

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,550
pitcher is because you see the  in site of

61
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,830
the apple to computer and the apple to

62
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,890
computer was action design to be really

63
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,630
easy to open your

64
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,780
you just had to take the member from behind

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,970
lift this and then you open the computer and

66
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:48,600
you so what's inside' 4 and one of the

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,910
things you could do is add your own

68
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,010
hardware and that's where die

69
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,160
try to you he was experiment in nicosia

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,110
ze teenager of course you will push lot

71
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,860
of

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,170
experiment in computers a very exciting

73
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,520
to die the loft programming and gaming

74
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,870
of cost with here and throws  the focus on

75
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,690
this bit of hardware and arm you

76
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,440
already know in there

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,930
and insert the slideshow apricot this is

78
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,130
there cirquit

79
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,160
de die designed a yes oh had to forty

80
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,540
years ago

81
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,670
well he of that bin in this name mit

82
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,770
couple of days ago

83
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,540
and he quietly  asleep insert this into

84
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,970
the slideshow this is this is a picture that

85
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,240
board such a plugin to your apple

86
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,760
computer and then interface with that apple

87
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,330
that god the iboard out of view was here

88
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,130
to go because it was the teenager and that

89
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,580


90
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,180
interface must be light  and then good e  and

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,200
online ton or so but this is the

92
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,330
following

93
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,640
he wound it up galvanic isolation

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,720
between the two

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
electricals triumphs go then des

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
techniques with the measurement is high

97
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,280
joest let that you can see here you

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,600
go to led led

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,880
and then a light dependent face as

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,150
high as  you can see here and magic

101
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,610
i was quite warm to mourn the light eye

102
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,490
door london led disk wheel loader

103
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,450
assistance of the register and then can

104
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,649
switch sonnerie leads to doors to a

105
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,798
light

106
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,390
so this is the präsentation of war this

107
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,730
here the symbol for having  just want him

108
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,990
really light

109
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,720
the symbol for light dependent register

110
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,130
that wheel

111
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,740
changes resistance and king to delight

112
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,210
depressed enzo f my green led here that

113
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,140
sensors green light and than life my

114
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,450
light dependent register here and

115
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,520
something i didn't know one he started

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,760
to to  design the swan uit dood is

117
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,250
dat that light deep in the register was

118
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,430
mainly sensitive to red light distress as

119
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,400
much to realize that more to red light

120
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,200
en std's en ding greenlight internet

121
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,230
light and as you can use it didn't work

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,850
or so and that is one of the four things

123
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,620
and of course a download yes

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,510
greenlight is different from red light

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,110
which is of course very op je wat that is

126
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,120
I think with experiments and how one

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,790
you're experiment in your and lace ring

128
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,550
yes on your fabric that you use journaux with

129
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,440
your head so learning new fabric and and you

130
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,660
can us so abstract because and like here

131
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,919
ok

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
hi learned a green light is this gun from

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,660

york has better channels the offers

138
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,900
compatible red and green and let in this

139
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,520
case was still compatible

140
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:48,350
such my mind count the malfunction beacause

141
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,830
this experiment absolutely some forty

142
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,930
years ago  a still remember this fact

143

abstract mn better think about them by

189
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,880
where experiment settings of just

190
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,229
learning the swing book now of course

the pending to your organization

192
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,550
it might be this experiment is and briefly

show of the search for some of your

194
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,500
in production en

195
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,650
formative you are something like you that you're not

196
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,330
very have a coach to do expert mens in

197
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,880
production then use the sourcing

198
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,479
and find another place to to to your own

199

for him in the net and car measurements

262
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,690
with the reason why mentioning here

263
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,070
homecoming is biko senior expert meeting

264
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:52,370
pro coming is one way to experiment and

265
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,520
der zwa  n in very important aspect the

266
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,560
program and the ride

267
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,470
requires precise support or the

268
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,540
programmer twelfth problem you tribes

269
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,300
or so be

270
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,420
fmf front or buy

271
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,700
program problem with safe for his own

272
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,880
poll you live to detect is

273
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,700
gate is open eyes on the shower to side

274
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,430
or  scan though the and then you will laugh

275
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,200
to be

276
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,510
clearly supported running port

277
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,520
is and how you can check even port is

278
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,400
open to be able to go from this zo that

279
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,320
is why am i talking about

280
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,390
homecoming here because if you start the

281
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,950
programming

282
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,980
you really want  die deepen into your

283
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,540
problem en zo

284
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,880
home your understanding of the problem

285
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,160
and find a solution lang going to

286
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,770
give you a very simple

287
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,340
if you want you can

288
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,850
get started with zo what we want to do

289
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:56,600


290
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,820
urls and those later who our box

291
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,850
for compost touches me what's with if

292
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,420


293
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,750
folds url ah fanning simple here now

294
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,310
I see simple that is due to millions vs age

295
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,780
that is determined whether the url this with as

296
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,270
fl  oot and our google strike generates

297
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,760
randomly but this is not completely

298
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,190
space to is to again detects

299
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,880
let me show you how

300
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,320
you will look up the ascii vayu

301
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,200
for something letter so the double you that's

302
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,210
ethical 7

303
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,140
de jane that is 70 for lower case is  that

304
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,800
some 115 and the heading is a bed

305
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,180
seventy-two

306
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,450
so that's the ascii value of box for

307
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,990
letters in the well if you add them to

308
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,800
gather

309
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,350
sisters him you end up with free

310
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,650
hundreds of forty-eight the next in your mouth

311
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,010
te  do as the sum is here do a

312
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,310
belt a third fish that often this by

313
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,110
20 and 50 six and ky3 less the module and

314
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,100
that's nike to-night the two of you

315
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,540
looked at dap

316
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,020
in the source code or with the sport for

317
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,890
not on  you want to see that this is the value

318
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,230
for windows tender so it is with doctor

319
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,500
always folds rua health of detectable

320
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,430
by this procedure your account the letters

321
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,710
will show your sides vario or the letters here

322
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,160
[ __ ] modulo and fiftysix do you have

323
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,450
mit toe

324

325
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,449
whistled why

326
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,470
how did you feel also i  n your figure that

327

salt wilder was saville row with one of

328
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,710
them is by joint good with up-load with

329
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,270
the sport source code to trap you her

330
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,800
opinion that god left something in ruby so

331
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,390
that probiblio language

332
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,570
young that of way to a lot of  so warm

333
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,930
with formula we to a alto out of this box

334
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:16,390
sustainable programming in ruby bits quite

335
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,840
some time ago so go on that up-to-date

epheze that is for rescued emerce

504
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,040
now if you understand how your stay duo

505
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,500
hills look like you might for example c

506
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,690
okay i'm going to choose on articles

507
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,970
path  but let that looks more common dat

508
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,180
so een curse realy random wat at hes

509
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,620
sum bin ein beat that it looks be mine

510
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,330
and by choosing your own determined I think

511
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,980
and our doe that je kas ok

512
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,690
he wound determined that looks like that's

513
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,000
calculator for you and  then for some

514
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,250
believe i designed the one to a mini

515
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,140
je me niet night i took its nike for

516
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,270
then how he dares to increase the value

517
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,200
of van

518
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,390

first leather ic change' dit to be and

520
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,640
then you'  re all you will be my key to

521
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,510
necessary thing you can do

522
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,850
here is us source to start modify

523
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,920
meta's never put it in bottles the theme

524
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,870
you don't want to be is not cold white

525

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,890
change the book but not that car

530
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,630
in both of user data shoot

531
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,850
that was built programming

532
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:10,779
so a first de vitamin add to

533
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:12,220
moist experiment in by

534
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,019
programming the cold and your app  to the

535
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,340
pea supports

536
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,590
what hiero what is going to be have

537
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,090
accessories with correct lee and interact

538
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,379
how this could i ran and invites in the die

539
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,210
de raven downloadable reflecting to

540
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,539
online do here for that said to be you

541
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,470
must be on your site is

542
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,690
keynote was in  my experiment in aos

543
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,299
soyuz sometimes flights national on

544
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,679
virtualization is something very

545
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:41,619
important romy after which i do experiment

546
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,249
speakers

547
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,859
most of the king's driver experiment on

548
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,100
my do that to hear my physical machine

549
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,440
but

550
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,539
corporate maybe he wants dude at

551
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,730
insight and virgil machine and after  good

552
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,609
couple of reasons to that and aj fax

553
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,059
libie lukkien toe what be able to start

554
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,499
using virtualization in early to

555
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:07,330
1000 because my vmware

556
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:13,090
to a came out and r  ondom it was

557
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,238
formide the place to go to experiment

558
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,100
so provoke you bataviawerf with or in

559
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,480
short that friend

560
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,029
virtualization technological y'all's

561
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,499
laforge ampel

562
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:34,869
virtualbox and what is import and then it

563
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:37,720
how it is virtualization that your

564
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,239
zeal for quality and that support

565
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:45,239
snapshots  so snapshots love you to take

566
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:50,109
a snapshot of the hefty machine from the

567
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:52,779
rhinestones in well so that your baby for

568
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,509
tweed suit leather and he does that quite

569
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:58,210
often hear you can see one of my virgin

570
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,909
machines that is there quite large snapshot

571
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:04,149
3 and arms grown to  the tail to dit in

572
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,289
the next

573
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,120
slides

574
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,290
ytc snapshots when i'm expert menting

575
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,070
for two creatures first of all for

576
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,550
account of history' of the operating

577
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,880
system of the application and secondly

578
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,700
de die teek snapshot right before or

579
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,870
after

580
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,690
import and steps in my experimentatie

581
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,530
lammy illustrates is when it comes

582
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,210
versions

583
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,480
so this is often more sting but

584
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,700
one of my window stem workstation

585
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,890
signal if you leave it

586
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,460
and so you can see a disorder in e  lk

587
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,559
dust a total of seventeen if you can wait

588
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,059
discussions in

589
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:50,980
was in every student has a test

590
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,650
because my names the archives in the

591
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,340
snapshots start again white did her

592
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,470
condition 17th here already 13 so that she is

593
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,740
undisturbed in 2017 and then what poverty or

594
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,580
to do because there  is an update to

595
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,290
microsoft him so easy kind of release

596
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,470
purchase a will update this version

597
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,809
machine en dennen license plate snapshots

598
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:20,140
like mike u cant see here in may or

599
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,590
in may 2013 book out here snapshot

600
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,559
here in july 2000 my team en zo thief

601
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,970
en places where

602
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,080
uit  i snap shot doing this applause mee

603
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
and i've used a couple of times only

604
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,640
allows me to go back to op articles

605
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,200
version when

606
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,470
and youfone ability of microsoft windows

607
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,130
hear needed application is discover

608
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,650
tourism blist than a can go back to one

609
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,510
of those snapshots  and start experiment

610
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,370
in windows and pheasants love there also

611
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:54,330
proof of koster explodes then also a

612
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,429
like and now that's in this a particle there

613
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,880
snapshot

614
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,280
another thing here we sew in

615
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,170
doing  a particle there experiment

616
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:11,020
like the seas here a snapshot of after

617
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,000
experiments tweet the ex-change onabi

618
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,490
song is zo ah to install exchange and

619
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,410
that form was a new experience

620
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,419
both out this is first of all in chair

621
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,659
and you catch me stabbing windows 2000 my

622
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,929
team machine here the ryan solidifies

623
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,419
den the neck strip then out this was

624
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:31,339
promotions by domain control and

625
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:32,959
backwards this detail our grant

626
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,830
snapshot

627
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,899
received something like this i go this santing ron

628
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:40,219
icann go back and then a guide to very

629
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,959
it how various ways to in stock

630
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,119
exchange en  that this is a word in

631
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,320
response to a

632
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,479
to install exchange family guide to

633
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:51,649
fulfill a lot of private 236 champing de

634
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:55,039
die er was able to innovation machine and

635
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,629
do step by step

636
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:59,749
zo van sean paul was

637
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:03,139
missing a particle there ornamental time that

638
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:04,489
was won of  the prairie zucchini

639
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:07,249
ok so unstable and then already try to

640
00:29:07,249 --> 00:29:10,399
install exchanges and to see has this

641
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,570
word my

642
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,479
has that didn't work but this den was

643
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,489
buck toe but snapshots just snapshot

644
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:17,690
river

645
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,209
and all that tide  d in a loop so that we can and

646
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:23,269
that we the clean in chair of x-change and

647
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:26,479
don lisette clean and insolvency that's

648
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:29,029
working we this is so walls that well

649
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,729
that this only' s3 they came there wheels

650
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:32,450
not it

651
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,759
and not all of  my experiment in which

652
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,979
failures they came day 10 bytes or the

653
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:38,839
problems that will then come

654
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,779
into action in files assignment and step back to

655
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:45,440
me snap shot and a starter the game and

656
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,229
then after high the headset die bozo able

657
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:51,079
to experiment with the proof of concept

658
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:55,429
stem cells try out the proof of

659
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,409
concept here

660
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,119
adimo my mobile i chose i was

661
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,489
sloane if necessary snapshots here here

662
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:05,479
already experiment how the post x change and

663
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:10,190
here in the industry but also start

664
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,879
to experiment with two instance of i

665
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,579
change pico's

666
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:19,489
en  to was able to zoom who chose sum of

667
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:21,459
the proof of concept didn't work

668
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,989
