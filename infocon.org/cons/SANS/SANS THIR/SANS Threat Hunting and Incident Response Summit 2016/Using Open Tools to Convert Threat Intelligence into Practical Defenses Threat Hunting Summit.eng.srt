1
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:19,380
so so somehow I get punished when I show

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,448
up to summits I'm not sure who I pissed

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,990
off and why but I get the after lunch

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,980
slot in every summit I go to so my job

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,959
is to keep you asleep

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,730
you know comfortably soothingly for the

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,230
rest of the afternoon until the next

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,660
feature can come up and actually take my

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,800
spot so what I want to talk about today

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,510
though for the time that I've been

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,730
allocated is take a little bit of time

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,070
to look at some of the open tools to

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,040
look at threat intelligence but also

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,020
look at what this means for defense and

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,019
to get started here just a little bit to

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,570
understand what we're talking about in

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,949
terms of hunting what what we're doing

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,770
and what we're working on is not

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,420
necessarily new and I think one of the

20
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,420
things that one of the failures we have

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,370
sometimes is we try to look at what

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,379
we're doing and view it as something

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,479
that no one's ever done before and

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,700
unfortunately what that means is we have

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,100
to go back and relearn the lessons that

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,960
other people have gone through and as a

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,509
result we lose that intelligence we lose

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,970
that opportunity and it turns out if we

29
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,850
look in the 1940s this is something that

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,840
was going on then as well I'm just a

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,039
little bit somewhat different

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
perspective and what I'd like to do is

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,610
start is understand a little bit about

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,890
that historic context apply that to what

35
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,930
we have today and then how we can use

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,920
that for better defense and the hunting

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,810
skills that we're going to actually be

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,729
engaged with and if we think about a

39
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,860
German u-boat u-boats and we look at

40
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,509
some of the things that were going on

41
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,420
about world war one we look at World War

42
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,909
two even pre-world War one it turns out

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,619
there was a lot of pain caused by the

44
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,630
German u-boats for obvious reasons a lot

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,759
of us know our history there and we saw

46
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,658
again thousands of lives lost and during

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,240
those win that window of opportunity

48
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,250
however the Germans were able to use

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,350
that particular weapon to their

50
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,380
advantage and one of the things that we

51
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,419
noticed is in the early days of hunting

52
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,250
we'll say we're talking about submarines

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,320
is you're faced with this problem you

54
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,300
had this open ocean and you said okay in

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,370
this sort of mass of see that you have

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,270
find the threat and with the threat that

57
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,440
you have eliminate the threat

58
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,150
in fact one of the things that happened

59
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,490
in early days prior to even World War

60
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,140
one is that it turns out that even the

61
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,330
use of things like death charges was

62
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,459
something completely brand-new that

63
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,200
attack tool wasn't even necessarily

64
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,290
available in fact it turns out prior to

65
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,470
World War one there were as many

66
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,600
submarines sank because of gunfire

67
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:38,500
because of depth charges and because of

68
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Navy captain's ramming submarines they

69
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,860
had no other way to take these things

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,630
down and so literally they would just

71
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,980
run into them because that was the only

72
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,200
thing they could do to actually stop

73
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,489
them from being a threat and so one of

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,049
the things we look at if we actually

75
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,880
take a look at some of the different

76
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,130
losses that were there if we look at the

77
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,670
period of time between 1939 and 1945

78
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:01,000
what you see is this gradual increase of

79
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,679
attacks by German u-boats against ships

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,960
crossing the Atlantic and this is part

81
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,190
of that battle for the Atlantic and one

82
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,230
of the things that's interesting is if

83
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,240
you look at this graph most co-coach

84
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,190
will see the the outlier right in the

85
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,110
center and you'll see sort of the

86
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,609
monthly and this is gonna graph by month

87
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,040
of the number of tacks that we're taking

88
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,530
place and you'll see at the peak we were

89
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,170
generally seeing upwards of 200 attacks

90
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,090
per month those are ships that were

91
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,339
attacked and oftentimes sank during that

92
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,880
window but then all of a sudden in May

93
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,110
of 1943 you see a drop-off and and

94
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,420
everyone most historians who talk to

95
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:37,209
will agree it's something in May 1943

96
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,070
happen that caused a change in the way

97
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,090
that this all occurred now if we look at

98
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,799
that graph and sort of understand well

99
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,720
what was it what was it that we look in

100
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,180
that particular window had it dropped

101
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,359
from almost 200 attacks per month down

102
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,830
to about 20 attacks per month what was

103
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,690
it that kind of led us to that scenario

104
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,090
now a lot of people of course want to

105
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,340
give benedict cumberbatch the credit for

106
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,840
that or Alan Turing I get confused which

107
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,730
one it is but but one of them they

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,350
wanted to give credit for the fact the

109
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,630
number went down it and don't get me

110
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,120
wrong what he did in the work on the

111
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:09,010
fourth rotor Enigma systems was amazing

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,030
it was great what he was able to do to

113
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,040
provide intelligence

114
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,350
she got community but it was more than

115
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,500
just intelligence that led to the

116
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,909
success of the the Allied ships against

117
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,470
the Navy that was there and one of the

118
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,270
things you see right away is you had the

119
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,320
use of naval escorts and air cover that

120
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,060
was something that was used more

121
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,430
predominantly in World War two than

122
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,110
World

123
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,090
one in Pryor hadn't really been used

124
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,800
before in addition to that they had

125
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,929
improved detection equipment there was

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,190
constant improvements and some of the

127
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,470
things that were going on with radio

128
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,090
signaling looking at radar in general

129
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,770
looking at stone our capabilities and

130
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,909
other things they improved over time

131
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,740
there was increased detection

132
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,210
capabilities and those detection

133
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,220
capabilities were put in the hands of

134
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,049
naval captain's to make good use of that

135
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,880
during the course of their expeditions

136
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,770
in addition to that we have improved

137
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,180
offensive weapons again the depth

138
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,469
charges that were used the torpedoes

139
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,880
that were used in other things again

140
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,470
they were better opportunities to

141
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,539
actually take out the submarines of

142
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,970
u-boats that were detected and there's

143
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,919
improved training and again for the the

144
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,770
hunters that were involved in us and

145
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,650
part of that training involved actively

146
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,020
going after the submarines prior to this

147
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,448
prior to World War two and prior to 1943

148
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,520
and we see this as this attack slow down

149
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,740
well what's happening was they would try

150
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,210
to avoid it and one of the primary

151
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,410
defenses they would do and actually you

152
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,180
see that sort of listed under the

153
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:25,190
intelligence side is the idea of RF

154
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,050
traffic analysis one of the things that

155
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,759
they would do is that they would say we

156
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,080
are gonna go ahead and look at traffic

157
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,150
patterns and they said we couldn't

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
necessarily read them and so even prior

159
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,030
to Turing being able to go through and

160
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,979
understand what some of those messages

161
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,630
were they could at least figure out

162
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,150
where the signals were coming from and

163
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,169
if we saw signals coming from here than

164
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,210
what the ship captains would do to

165
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,740
simply avoid that area and they would go

166
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,448
someplace else but then what would the

167
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,590
submarine captains do they would watch

168
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,330
for the traffic from the Allied

169
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,349
commanders and they would move where the

170
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,210
other ships were moving and it became

171
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,130
this game of cat-and-mouse that a end of

172
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,469
the day it wasn't really working out but

173
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,110
what they did was they provided training

174
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,970
to the hunters as well to give them

175
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,470
increased capability to figure out what

176
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,180
they needed to do to detect these ships

177
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,300
these submarines u-boats that were there

178
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,760
and available but a part of the Sun was

179
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,229
defense that there were these defensive

180
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,479
activities going on that the allies were

181
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,520
engaged in in addition to that what we

182
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,199
see is we see better intelligence again

183
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,729
the RF traffic analysis was taking place

184
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,560
and of course certainly we want to talk

185
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,300
about what Turing dead and the the

186
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,889
decryption of the offensive information

187
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,599
that was being given to these u-boat

188
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,190
captains the thing where I'm trying to

189
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,340
explain here is that these things work

190
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,479
together to provide defense and even

191
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,950
though I know certainly we're at a

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,990
hunting summit and I don't want to

193
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,370
minimize that role at all I think this

194
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,810
is a part of the equation I

195
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,010
one of the challenges and sort if I can

196
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,000
give maybe a flavor to what I would be

197
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,430
able to talk about for the next few

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,530
minutes is this as one piece of the

199
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,110
overall pie for defense that we're

200
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,210
trying to achieve if you tried to say we

201
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,669
want to go ahead and do this a better

202
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,320
response or better hunting without the

203
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,240
presence of the tools that are in place

204
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,370
I think it's going to be a lot more

205
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,780
frustrating that we try to do in fact

206
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,699
what I think we're gonna find in many of

207
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,229
us we find ourselves here in a

208
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,910
challenging situation where resources

209
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,800
just aren't being allocated like we'd

210
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,300
like and as a result you know we may

211
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,949
talk about situations like let's say

212
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,270
with carbon black up here earlier and I

213
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,830
think a lot of us would agree wow it's

214
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,090
it's amazing toolkit they have a lot of

215
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,590
really great things they could do or

216
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,789
even if we don't talk about carbon black

217
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,190
just talk about application whitelisting

218
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,389
in general and to a large degree some of

219
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,130
the work that we're doing is because

220
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,320
frankly we don't have the resources or

221
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,699
the time or the maybe political will to

222
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,680
be able to do things like that

223
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,910
whitelisting we're describing so what I

224
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,320
want to start with is we talked about

225
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,900
sort of history then there's this this

226
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,870
understanding of threat layered defenses

227
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,159
layered again offense or sorry detective

228
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,810
and preventative detects are there

229
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,789
threat intelligence and again these

230
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,289
intelligent hunters and operators that

231
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,090
have the ability to work together you

232
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,039
know Rob and I joked a little bit about

233
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,080
the idea of how much can this be

234
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,490
automated versus how much is a manual

235
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,930
activity that's here and what we're

236
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,150
trying to suggest is that it's going to

237
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,250
be a combination you're going to have

238
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,388
automation that helps what it's going to

239
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,560
do is it's going to help you what we're

240
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,139
gonna call as we go through the day

241
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,940
define the battlefield you have an

242
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,039
opportunity not only to look at this

243
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,710
ocean and say let's see what's out there

244
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,659
but you have an opportunity to narrow

245
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,280
down the battlefield to say this is

246
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,289
where we know the attack will take place

247
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,359
and that's something that the submarine

248
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,919
commander or the submarine again hunters

249
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,080
didn't have the opportunity to do back

250
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,789
in World War two so a couple of things

251
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,710
we're going to start with unclear

252
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,780
definitions of threat are gonna lead us

253
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,510
to unclear definitions or architectures

254
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,549
for defense if we don't know what it is

255
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,080
we're trying to defend against it turns

256
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,520
out it's very difficult for us to agree

257
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,020
how we're going to actually defend

258
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,539
ourselves and so that's a big part of

259
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,319
our problem today in along with that one

260
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,968
of the things I think that we've

261
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,310
discovered is that there really are

262
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,450
limited taxonomy for threat a couple

263
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,829
years ago we started some of the

264
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,900
projects I'll reference in a few minutes

265
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,500
there were literally as of a year and a

266
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,390
half ago zero taxonomy zuv threat that

267
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,779
you could get a hold of and so over the

268
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,910
last

269
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,699
about 18 months or so there are three of

270
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,410
them now we won one of them Nisa has run

271
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,120
one and mightor has done some more

272
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,069
research on their side as well but

273
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,019
because of the so we have now more tools

274
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:05,969
more information that we can use for the

275
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,129
purpose of hunting and again on the

276
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,569
defensive side as well so we say this a

277
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:11,850
different way how do we go about

278
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:13,649
blocking militias have hashes if we

279
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,749
don't have a whitelisting tool it's

280
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:17,399
great if we get the hash but if we don't

281
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:19,079
have a way to block how we can actually

282
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,240
take advantage of that or if we have

283
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,248
idea signatures but we don't have an IDs

284
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,379
how do we actually respond or how do we

285
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:27,059
analyze traffic from the malicious code

286
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,860
passing across our networks if we don't

287
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,899
have packet captures and it sounds so

288
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,430
basic but I feel like I'm in the

289
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,170
position where I'm telling everyone you

290
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,459
have to eat your vegetables before you

291
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,229
can go out and do some of the more

292
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,518
advanced from the funner things and I

293
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,139
think the trouble that a lot of the

294
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,389
organizations we work with in every

295
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,100
single day is still people still don't

296
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,730
have white lifting people still don't

297
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,769
have IDS's people still rarely outside

298
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,809
of their border do packet captures and

299
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:54,029
so without these tools it makes it

300
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:55,649
really difficult for us to do response

301
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:57,300
had an incident response case a couple

302
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,029
years back and it was a very large media

303
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,680
company and in dealing with them they

304
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,240
said we have we have found this

305
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,339
information we found there they're being

306
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,379
hosted with a web drop or up off of

307
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,579
their website and they're infecting

308
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,559
people visiting their site and suchlike

309
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,420
using the forbes.com that sort of thing

310
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,009
was going on and so they got us involved

311
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,170
when it went to there and went to their

312
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,459
information team and we said listen all

313
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,199
right we want to respond and they said

314
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,579
okay great they said because we want to

315
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:22,079
take these people to court we want to

316
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,149
take these people down we want to find

317
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,559
out who did this to us we are convinced

318
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,879
you know that this is evilness and we

319
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:28,860
want to take care of this we said great

320
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,589
so let's look at you know what do you

321
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,850
have on the log side regarding what's

322
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,529
been happening on these systems and they

323
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,610
said well we don't have logs because

324
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,870
that's something that somebody else

325
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,920
handles and we don't have access to

326
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,759
those systems and we don't have logs

327
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,559
said okay fine

328
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,329
okay well do you have at least new disk

329
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,500
images so we can look at maybe season

330
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:45,300
the artifacts they're present from the

331
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,470
disk perspective and say well no it's on

332
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,609
a hosting company and we don't have

333
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,920
access to those and they won't give us

334
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,720
access said okay so do you have anything

335
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,769
in terms of let's say memory the same

336
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,939
thing said no we don't have memory

337
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,040
nothing like that we can play with it

338
00:10:53,939 --> 00:10:57,748
said ok any packet captures any logs

339
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,399
anything whatsoever we can look at they

340
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:01,949
said no we have the dropper we have the

341
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,800
malware itself and so we want to

342
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,550
prosecute so here's a dropper it's PHP

343
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,109
code

344
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,209
sure enough it's used by all sorts of

345
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,310
exploit kits but we want you to tell us

346
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,800
who did this to us so that we can

347
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,089
prosecute them and and of course as most

348
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,870
of us know it's not going to happen it's

349
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,640
not going to be something that's gonna

350
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,170
be a reality but what we're trying to

351
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,730
suggest is let's put the defenses in

352
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,589
place maybe not to prosecute but at

353
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,269
least to have the ability to respond we

354
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,200
find these events taking place that's

355
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,060
what we're gonna be suggesting here

356
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,180
today case in point

357
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,339
apt one this was released a few years

358
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,930
ago this is not something new most of us

359
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,310
are aware of the apt one report you're

360
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,069
aware of comment crew you're aware of

361
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,569
ugly gorilla hopefully we all read this

362
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,040
report it was very good when it came out

363
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,570
there's a number of others CrowdStrike

364
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,709
has some good ones a lot of good reports

365
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,010
similar to this that have come out since

366
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,810
the apt one report came up came out in

367
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,310
the appendix now the report itself is

368
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,839
great I think a lot of us probably read

369
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,880
that what the 30-some pages because

370
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
those are of a spy novel as many of you

371
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,140
read but of course we're the real meat

372
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,410
and the value was that came out of this

373
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:03,480
was in the appendix and if you look in

374
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:05,790
the appendix what do we see we saw over

375
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,459
3,000 specific indicators of compromised

376
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,319
gaze listed there names like the names

377
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,609
of the exploits the actual file names

378
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,350
you can look at in fact there's regular

379
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,120
expressions you could really easily have

380
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,339
written based on some the exploits that

381
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,350
were discovered output files written in

382
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,940
a certain format that again if we looked

383
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,110
at that information it'd be easy enough

384
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,730
for us to be able to figure out how to

385
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,829
write regex expressions to look for

386
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,470
those output files that we're using 13

387
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:29,729
certificates used during the compromises

388
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,110
40 different malware families many of

389
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,000
which were just office shelf pieces of

390
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,740
malware anyways but we had access to

391
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,320
those those signatures that we could use

392
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,240
and at the time when this is released we

393
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,450
asked people ok here we go we have the

394
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,760
names of domains in the certificates

395
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,740
that you can look for we have the names

396
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,270
of domains that we know are being used

397
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,970
in some cases for command and control

398
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,010
and so we said great can you go look in

399
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,990
your DNS logs to pull this information

400
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,930
out and organization after organization

401
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,890
said yeah we don't have those locks and

402
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,390
so here we have intelligence or handing

403
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,100
you intelligence industry is giving you

404
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,439
information that you can do to detect

405
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,930
badness right here's one of these apt

406
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,910
groups but yet most of the organizations

407
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,920
that weed out with at least had no idea

408
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,850
what to do with it I'm not saying

409
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,199
there's any trouble with our

410
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,820
intelligence I'm just saying we've got

411
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,390
to be able to use it though for this to

412
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,610
be valuable for organizations

413
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,019
so there are some prereqs to get into

414
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,209
this industry and actually start playing

415
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,350
I like we like so the model that we're

416
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:29,349
gonna suggest is something along these

417
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,110
lines here the idea is enter at any

418
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,899
point but if we have threat intelligence

419
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,300
so if we can get access this information

420
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,839
that threat intelligence and our opinion

421
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,250
should lead to the selection of controls

422
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,410
because depending on the type of

423
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:47,440
information that you're given you may

424
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,149
need extra detective capability to

425
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
detect the badness that's taking place

426
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,190
so again take your threat intelligence

427
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,050
identify it classify it and understand

428
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,269
what sort of detective mechanisms or

429
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,550
artifacts do we need because of what's

430
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,220
discovered use that to select controls

431
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,569
use our selection to implement actually

432
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,390
do the thing that we know is the right

433
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,940
thing to do and then from there we can

434
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,680
detect evil once we've detected evil we

435
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,000
can use that to increase or sort of

436
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,920
improve the threat intelligence that we

437
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,180
have access to and of course repeat this

438
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:22,029
cycle now imagine we can do this as an

439
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,630
industry and not just you as you're on

440
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,820
your own

441
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,110
not just with a handshakes or the people

442
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,399
that you meet at these events and

443
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,720
there's nothing wrong with that I think

444
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,640
some of the best intelligence I've ever

445
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,220
received has been by attending events

446
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,199
like this meeting people in hallways you

447
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,880
know having those friend das in place

448
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,649
right with the people around us and then

449
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,750
learning from the people that we talked

450
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,459
to but at the same time what if we got

451
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,410
more formalized and actually started

452
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,910
sharing that information so that we can

453
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,019
do better as an industry that's a

454
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,240
suggestion that we're going to hope for

455
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,130
now that means that our thought of

456
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,430
course is that threat identification

457
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:57,610
threat definition should lead to control

458
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,349
or countermeasure definition if we know

459
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,510
how bad behavior is taking place if we

460
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,010
know what evil looks like then we should

461
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:05,110
be able to put detective controls in

462
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,930
place to stop the evil and then also

463
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,820
hopefully ideally even prevent some of

464
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,649
the evil that's there now this isn't

465
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,570
gonna be a perfect process as many of

466
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,459
you have dealt with the information

467
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,930
sharing and analysis centers the i-x

468
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:18,880
that are out there many of you know a

469
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,800
lot of the Isaac data is great but

470
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,390
there's also deletes it takes a little

471
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
bit of time to get that information to

472
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,680
actually get into people's hands to get

473
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,050
a process but even if we only have

474
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,449
access to some of those basic data sets

475
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,189
that are available to us we can use that

476
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:35,620
to weed out some of the No

477
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,750
and we can start to use the rest of our

478
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,240
attention to focus on what's really

479
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:42,279
unique in our environment there's going

480
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,600
to be a lot of noise and yes maybe

481
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,449
threat hunting isn't going to be

482
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,459
completely automated but we can use some

483
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:50,319
of the automation tools we have to limit

484
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,119
the noise it's in place so we can focus

485
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:53,769
on the things that are unique to us and

486
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,990
that's a part that I believe may be more

487
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,040
useful of your time so get let's get an

488
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,389
example and one of the things I know the

489
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,519
carbon black had an opportunity to talk

490
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,660
about and rightfully so is a lot of the

491
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,800
different PowerShell attacks that are

492
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,199
out there there's been a few different

493
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,670
illusions to the idea that PowerShell

494
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,740
attacks are out there if you're not

495
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,479
investing investigating windows remote

496
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,620
management and some of those tools you

497
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,449
probably want to spend a little time

498
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,649
looking into that to be fair I've heard

499
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,209
a lot of people especially on the pen

500
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,490
test side make recommendations saying

501
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,859
hey you need to turn off windows remote

502
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,269
management because these invoke command

503
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,709
commands that you saw people talking

504
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:26,230
about earlier this morning those are

505
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,329
useful if you enable those functions and

506
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,189
that's fine and I get why we'd want to

507
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:32,649
do that but at the same time it also

508
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:34,719
makes it easier for your sis at mins for

509
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:36,819
your defenders to look for badness to

510
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,579
look for evil like we saw earlier my

511
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:42,490
take on it is honestly disabling when RM

512
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,790
is basically like saying let's get rid

513
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,709
of tcp/ip because if we have tcp/ip it

514
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,469
makes it way too easy for the attackers

515
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,000
to break into our systems so again you

516
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,439
can have the conversation but it looks

517
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,029
like it this is one of the the malware

518
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,459
pieces is PowerShell ransomware

519
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,410
the Trend Micro detected a couple years

520
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:01,000
ago a lot have you been reading about it

521
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,160
the news lately now this is actually has

522
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,659
been tected as early as 2013 if not

523
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,299
earlier I found at least references to

524
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:09,309
2013 for this malware but let's say that

525
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:11,589
we have an example of ransomware along

526
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:12,730
these lines and I know a lot of people

527
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,839
have looked at things like PowerShell

528
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,059
base ransomware and said this is a

529
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,129
little scarier it's not an exe it's not

530
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,510
an msi so I've got a little more fear

531
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,640
around this you know could I can

532
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,169
actually detect that script file that's

533
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,510
there because I want to be able to allow

534
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,459
powershell exe to execute but how do i

535
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:29,590
make sure i limit let's say the

536
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,870
ransomware here from executing but yet

537
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,520
still allow partial exe to run well it

538
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,260
turns out most of your whitelisting

539
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,668
solutions are gonna have different

540
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,620
settings available even if you just use

541
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,289
app Locker from Microsoft right the

542
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,149
basic stuff built in for free Windows 7

543
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:46,299
and later it's there for you to use it

544
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:47,020
has a differentiator between Exe EMS is

545
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,090
a

546
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,610
the powershell scripts so you can say

547
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,610
apply this logic to your scripts and

548
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,500
this logic to your exe is so let's say

549
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,379
that we know the attack in this case the

550
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,510
threat is ransomware that comes out

551
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,370
again via powershell so that it would

552
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,220
seem then that threat intelligence if

553
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,020
someone tells us i this is evil you need

554
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,630
to be aware of this then the proper

555
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,820
response to evil is okay well how do we

556
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,350
detect it how do we stop it from

557
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,990
executing and if we think of us in terms

558
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,480
of let's say a control we could use a

559
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,730
carbon 9 or carbon black or the bit 9

560
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,710
tools we could use app lock or something

561
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,690
similar to say let's stop this from

562
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,370
executing and so we can use that as it

563
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,440
controls the defense we're a threat

564
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,540
consequence would be data encryption

565
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,040
data loss you know all those kind of

566
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,750
things that you see people dealing with

567
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,550
now because of the ransomware that's out

568
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,370
there so a couple of things to think

569
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,360
about them from our standpoint so as we

570
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,860
started to talk about this

571
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,389
more and more and some of the risk

572
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,469
discussions we're having not it's a part

573
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,390
of threat hunting but it's a part of

574
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,270
risk discussions and control selection

575
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,790
that we started to say is there a point

576
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:55,120
though when it comes to the defensive

577
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:58,600
side where maybe the intelligence has a

578
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,989
point of diminishing returns in other

579
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,550
words could I get to a point where I get

580
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:06,160
overwhelmed by the intelligence that's

581
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,580
available to me and and as a result I

582
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,470
get so focused spending my time

583
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,960
analyzing that data set that I don't

584
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,000
actually defend myself or that I don't

585
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,610
actually have time to do the hunting

586
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,830
that we're describing and the theme that

587
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,000
I hear perpetually and in a hundred

588
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:24,309
percent of the organizations that we

589
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,429
talked to is that there's never enough

590
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:29,350
time if there's never enough time then

591
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,809
we need to do everything in our power to

592
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:34,149
focus ourselves and focus the time that

593
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,649
we have so that we're focusing our

594
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,140
energies and the things that honestly

595
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,510
make sense for us so the question we

596
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,910
have then does a taxonomy of threat

597
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,220
agents influence control selection in

598
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:48,730
other words if you knew who the bad guys

599
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:50,740
were does this change the way you behave

600
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,990
if I tell you it's a Syrian electronic

601
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,200
army or I tell you it's comment crew

602
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,429
does it matter do you care which of them

603
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,830
is running with say sequel injection

604
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,710
attacks against you would we change our

605
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,139
defenses there was

606
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,600
of that or said another way do we need

607
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,250
to know specific threat agents or does

608
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,029
threat intelligence in may these cases

609
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:13,940
change our control selection or is just

610
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:16,730
enough data good enough to make good

611
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,010
decisions to actually do defense so

612
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,330
let's take an example let's say that

613
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,610
we're dealing with web server attacks

614
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,428
okay so let's say that we look at Olas

615
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,990
data for the top 10 web threats that

616
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,610
they released in 2013 we all know Oh

617
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,799
lost a lot of you read their studies

618
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,059
great resources we all love them so

619
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,529
hopefully you're participating what's

620
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,990
going on over there but we see here

621
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,690
unless this was their list of threats

622
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,909
that they released in 2013 well let's do

623
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,200
a little case study with us so let's say

624
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:44,450
that's a threat list that they've

625
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,669
released that's their industry research

626
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,870
this is the threat intelligence that

627
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,450
they're providing you they're saying

628
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,489
this is how the bad guys are getting in

629
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,809
to your web apps okay so this is it

630
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,610
based on their research every few years

631
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:56,928
they change this list and we say all

632
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,000
right let's see if that's actually true

633
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:02,480
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look

634
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,549
at my web logs and compare my web logs

635
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,590
to what I see over from all ah let's see

636
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,960
if this is gonna be true because maybe

637
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,220
the information I have on my systems

638
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,779
maybe I'm being targeted

639
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,070
maybe the attackers are going after me

640
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,090
have a slightly different idea or

641
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,399
different tool sets that are gonna be

642
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,168
using so I say okay so let me look at

643
00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:20,809
the data that I have and compare it to

644
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:22,669
what a wasp is telling me so I look at

645
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,870
my list here and we say ok the first bar

646
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:26,120
there is going to be their number one

647
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,129
for injection or number two will be

648
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,049
authentication and you see well number

649
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,480
two does appear to be a little bit lower

650
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:33,860
than number three but it's not that far

651
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,130
off so I probably shouldn't panic too

652
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:40,250
much but number four seems quite a bit

653
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,529
lower than number five and if I look at

654
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,080
okay insecure direct object references

655
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:46,909
number four in my logs I don't see that

656
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,678
as much as maybe security miss

657
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,210
configuration number five that green bar

658
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,130
in the middle courses is all completely

659
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,820
made-up but let's say this is what we

660
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:57,500
discover and my list doesn't quite match

661
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,439
up mean it's sorta matches but not

662
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,120
completely with what awastha saying okay

663
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,799
so I say well maybe it's a normalization

664
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,570
issue maybe they're just I haven't

665
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,899
looked at it for a long enough period of

666
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,309
time

667
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:08,600
all right the very obvious all right so

668
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:10,668
okay so I say let's look at the data

669
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,350
from a little longer perspective and so

670
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,490
I take multiple years worth of data

671
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,469
because I actually

672
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,000
this okay now how many of us have this

673
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,260
information probably very few of you but

674
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,090
let's pretend that we did let's pretend

675
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,160
that we're data hoarders and then we

676
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,809
save these logs and we really want to

677
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,179
know what this is all about so we save

678
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,500
the information again we look and we

679
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,929
think oh my gosh now I'm even more

680
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,360
confused because originally if I look at

681
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,830
the green bar there in 2014 it looks

682
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,199
like I had certain attacks taking place

683
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,240
but now I've got cross-site scripting

684
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,370
keeps popping up in 2015 that I wasn't

685
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,050
seeing before I still see direct object

686
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,669
references taking place less or fewer

687
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,830
times than others but security Miss

688
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:49,760
configuration while a big deal in 2014

689
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:51,350
is much less in 2015 so let's say all

690
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,850
this is true now now I look at all this

691
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,520
information that's they are data wise

692
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:59,350
there so I asked myself should I

693
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,350
implement a Web Application Firewall

694
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,880
does it make a difference any of the

695
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:07,160
data that I've collected does it change

696
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,630
my opinion on whether I should influence

697
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,309
it or put in a web app firewall or not

698
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,840
and I think most of us would probably

699
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:13,129
say well yeah that kind of makes sense

700
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,178
because it's gonna stop a lot of the

701
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,380
things that we're talking about here any

702
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,760
because I might how oh how are we gonna

703
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,970
actually detect this stuff to begin with

704
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,620
right

705
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,500
anyway absolutely all right what about

706
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,290
should we stop scanning our applications

707
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,200
for vulnerabilities based on the fact

708
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,720
that we see different data sets than

709
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,970
wasp should we say you know what we have

710
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,040
web inspect or app scan let's toss it

711
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,110
right what's the value here because my

712
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,428
data doesn't match well it's stupid

713
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,260
right of course we're gonna still scan

714
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:43,640
our application for vulnerabilities so

715
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,870
if we look at some of this information I

716
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,350
guess my question at the end of the day

717
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:52,100
I'm gonna ask is are we gonna change our

718
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:55,159
defense at all based on the information

719
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,260
we've gathered now if over enough time

720
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,400
to be completely fair if we go back and

721
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,379
look at some of these lists if you look

722
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,170
at number 8 cross-site request forgeries

723
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:05,570
if we look about 8 or 10 years ago that

724
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,160
didn't show up on the list if I look at

725
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,200
the Olas list from again about eight

726
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,670
eight or ten years ago that one wasn't

727
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,950
there people said that's theoretical

728
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,840
that doesn't actually happen we can't

729
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,090
believe that's a real attack but now

730
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,520
today we know it's not as hard as people

731
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,350
think it is so maybe we said yeah after

732
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,480
about us five eight year 10 year period

733
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,250
we're gonna change our defenses a little

734
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,110
bit to stop against those cross-site

735
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,420
request forgery attacks okay fine that's

736
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,219
a

737
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,900
valid response that you would have so

738
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,580
again if I look at this the thought is

739
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,550
again although the frequencies may

740
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,830
change we still know what the general

741
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,210
categories of threat are that are facing

742
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,939
these particular web applications that

743
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,280
we have so not implementing these

744
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,340
controls per particular threat might

745
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,810
possibly indicate still risk for us if I

746
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,820
say I'm just gonna try to fix the top

747
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:53,100
three or the top five on that list the

748
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,909
other threats don't go away even if

749
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,320
we're talking about this in terms of

750
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,400
risk management or something people like

751
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,350
to say well you know we're gonna

752
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,970
implement risk management or risk based

753
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,070
approach to control selection that's

754
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,630
great but that doesn't mean that all of

755
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,040
a sudden you're not vulnerable if you

756
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,180
don't address those lower ones just cuz

757
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,530
you don't have enough money to deal with

758
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,020
it hey there's still gonna be something

759
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,520
that can cause harm to your system so

760
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,150
documented prioritizations it turns out

761
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,560
our not a valid defense people aren't

762
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,560
gonna look at your exception forums to

763
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,720
say huh I see that you didn't implement

764
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,820
whitelisting because you felt like it

765
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,710
was too difficult and not politically

766
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,330
going to be accepted in the company you

767
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,910
know what I'm not gonna run my

768
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,250
disk-based binaries against you because

769
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,950
you have an exception form written in

770
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:36,420
this face of course again that's of

771
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,310
course we know that that's crap but

772
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,720
again the point being and we use this

773
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,520
but I think there's a point potentially

774
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,170
of diminishing returns that we look at

775
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,030
and of course the question of course

776
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,380
there was another vendor that I may or

777
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,389
may not wanted to have put on the slide

778
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,540
but for the sake of timeliness decided

779
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,940
not to but put threat but let's say on

780
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:57,690
the map instead but is the PPU map

781
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,040
really what we're looking for or is it

782
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,270
something maybe to help us on the

783
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,920
defense and I think unfortunately

784
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,270
sometimes this is you know what we don't

785
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,920
always like to admit it but maybe what

786
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,510
we're looking for a little bit and are

787
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,150
some of our defenses so here's our

788
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,260
solution here's what we're recommending

789
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:16,050
number one if you understand threat

790
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,210
organizations who see badness we believe

791
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,530
should share what they know if you're

792
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,580
detecting it if you're working with a

793
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,250
nice AK if you're working with

794
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,139
organisations who see badness we say you

795
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,000
should share what you've learned about

796
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,350
and if you listen to President Obama the

797
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,240
beginning last year what did he say he

798
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,260
went to Stanford he stood up he created

799
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,630
some new positions in the federal

800
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,030
government and he said the problem we

801
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:37,950
have is that we don't share data and

802
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,570
that's what's a solution they proposed

803
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,600
sharing more information and there is

804
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,370
some truth that's not

805
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,290
the only thing but part of the solution

806
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,300
is we do need to share a little bit more

807
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:48,760
than we do we've been getting better

808
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,570
about this maybe about the last me six

809
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,240
or seven years

810
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,179
remember it's not been that long since

811
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,120
we didn't even admit to each other that

812
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,220
we had breaches eight years ago nine

813
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,709
years ago remember we didn't even talk

814
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,720
about this stuff so does not to say in

815
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,160
another five years maybe we do start

816
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,930
sharing a little bit more not just about

817
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,820
the breaches taking place but about the

818
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,470
threats that we're seeing too the other

819
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,020
thing that we're suggesting is that that

820
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,270
information you share be classified in

821
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,389
such a way that we can use that to make

822
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,830
good control decisions as a community if

823
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,240
we can all look at what are those

824
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,070
threats that we're seeing we classify

825
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,020
those threats then we can turn that into

826
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,300
some sort of taxonomy that we can all

827
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,820
agree on then we can use that taxonomy

828
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,710
hopefully to define and prioritize the

829
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,030
defensive controls that we want to put

830
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,980
into place to actually defend ourselves

831
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,440
and some of those that we're gonna all

832
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,050
agree to will be detected in nature

833
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,460
they're gonna be the IDS's they're gonna

834
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,770
be the yards they're gonna be these

835
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,600
tools that we can use for the purpose of

836
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,010
finding badness and finding the evil

837
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,169
that's around us there and then

838
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:52,470
hopefully we would implement those

839
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,120
controls that were suggested to us

840
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,490
implementing controls and paired with

841
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,919
threat intelligence can be used to

842
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,540
detect specific attacks and my fear the

843
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,040
thing that worries me still is that

844
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,530
sometimes we get really excited about

845
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,750
these buzzwords and we say let's go

846
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,090
focus on let's say one of the detective

847
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,070
tools as opposed to going out and

848
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,919
actually trying to stop the badness in

849
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,020
the first place we say let's go out and

850
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,430
and I've heard this with the ransomware

851
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,710
cases especially here recently

852
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,120
I keep seeing recommendations from like

853
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,800
Health and Human Services and other

854
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,090
groups and especially because a lot of

855
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,649
hospitals and health care groups are

856
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:28,149
getting hit by this I saw a Health and

857
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,590
Human Service and a couple of other FBI

858
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,510
came out and they said listen the

859
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,330
response to ransomware is you should

860
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,700
really make sure you've got good backups

861
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:38,530
you should really make sure you've got

862
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,850
good business continuity and I'm good

863
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,889
with that right I like get the

864
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,560
importance of that but why can't we say

865
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,510
whitelisting why can't we start with a

866
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,639
thing that we all know is going to stop

867
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,420
that from taking place and that's the

868
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,010
sort of thing we want to have

869
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,450
conversations about so we'll come to

870
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,220
questions in just a couple minutes all

871
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:55,870
right so the thought is it then

872
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,890
we don't want us to jump to step five we

873
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,090
don't want it to sort of jump to the end

874
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:04,090
but what if we could jump to Step five

875
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,129
what if you go home and you don't have

876
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,189
to do steps one through four wouldn't it

877
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,240
be cool if we could just jump right to

878
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,730
using other people's data for the

879
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,880
purpose of defense like we see there but

880
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,470
it turns out language matters and I've

881
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,559
heard it this way already this morning

882
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:24,340
right language matters right if we say

883
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,460
let's eat grandma it's different then

884
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,490
let's eat grandma right it makes a

885
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,740
difference the words that we use matter

886
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,150
and that's one of the things that we've

887
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,090
been working with here over the last few

888
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:39,760
months it turns out in 2015 and 2016

889
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,470
that it turns out that if I looked at

890
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,360
the vendor threat reports and by the way

891
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:46,030
this is kind of what we do as crazy as

892
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,620
it sounds we enjoy reading those reports

893
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,450
now to be fair as we're all sort of

894
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,100
indicated we do a lot of work at the

895
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,299
Center for Internet security and we

896
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,158
volunteer in lot of other places like

897
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:55,870
that a lot of the researchers have been

898
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,940
willing to come to us the Verizon's and

899
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,289
others and talk to us about integrating

900
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,000
things from the critical security

901
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:02,559
controls and similar projects into their

902
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,730
threat reports so we have a lot of

903
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,379
insight into some of the things that

904
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,480
semantic and derives and others are

905
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,919
putting out but anyways if we look at

906
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,030
the list of some of the things though

907
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,590
that were listed as threats in 2015 and

908
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,840
16 some of these I can kind of

909
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,149
understand like Iranian hackers or the

910
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,980
Chinese hacking groups or the crimeware

911
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,679
exploit toolkits and these sort of sound

912
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,559
like threats to me but no joke the

913
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,950
Internet of Things laptops and

914
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,399
point-of-sale systems were listed in the

915
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,100
same reports as a Syrian electronic army

916
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,900
so does that mean if I see the Syrian

917
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,840
electronic army and my network I should

918
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,669
be scared I think the answer is yes but

919
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,949
if I see let's say a point-of-sale

920
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:47,230
system does that mean I should have the

921
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,929
same level of fear about a point-of-sale

922
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,610
system in my environment is that as big

923
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,350
of a threat to me as the Syrian

924
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,389
electronic army and it sounds like

925
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,709
there's a definition problem it sounds

926
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,059
like yes I understand that there are

927
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:00,190
let's say quote-unquote threats you that

928
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,860
we're dealing with but it seems to me

929
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,600
threat agents sometimes we refer this as

930
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,439
threat sources I sort of like agents

931
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,770
here though is what kind of what I've

932
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,470
been going with lately threat agents

933
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,639
perform threat actions against threat

934
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,110
targets in order to achieve threat

935
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,000
consequences so it's a combination of

936
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,340
these things working together and in

937
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,560
fact these these seem to be the buckets

938
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,360
that we want to use to maybe break

939
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,030
things up so yes the Syrian electronic

940
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,590
army would be an agent just like mother

941
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,149
nature would be an agent but a

942
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,070
point-of-sale system might be lets say a

943
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,020
target okay so again we can separate

944
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,399
these definitions out so what would seem

945
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,410
to me is we need to have some sort of

946
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,720
definition around this and actually try

947
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,280
as a community to come up with what are

948
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,110
the agreed-upon terms let's actually

949
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,970
decide what are these threats in these

950
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,159
different categories let's define the

951
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,230
categories and maybe even move towards a

952
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,670
taxonomy and use the things as a

953
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,100
community that we have at our disposal

954
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:55,260
so it turns out this is not a made-up

955
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,520
thing it turns out this is a project

956
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,620
we've been working on for the last

957
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,540
couple of years the tool that I would

958
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,949
sort of start you all with today is the

959
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,530
use of what we call the open threat

960
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,910
taxonomy the open threat taxonomy was

961
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,500
originally released for the purpose of

962
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,660
doing the things we just talked about in

963
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,090
fact we have a new version of this that

964
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,740
we're working on right now so we are

965
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,149
actually literally in the middle of a

966
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,560
review cycle right now it's kind of

967
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:18,480
hoping we'd be done by it before we got

968
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,100
here this week but we are making

969
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,050
progress we've got a great group of over

970
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,860
150 different organizations represented

971
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:28,440
anything from the FBI to Microsoft and

972
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,600
Verizon and the World Bank a number of

973
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,490
other agencies sans a bunch of Penn test

974
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,139
teams and so a lot of good groups good

975
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,010
people willing to volunteer their time

976
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,960
because that's all we are

977
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,790
we're just volunteers trying to bring

978
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,200
good information together so that we can

979
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,580
define some of these threats that we've

980
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,500
been talking about and do the things

981
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,510
that we've been describing so that being

982
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,580
said we want to just understand what are

983
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:49,140
the categories of threats come up with a

984
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:51,240
hierarchy of these come up with an

985
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,650
inventory and then once we have that

986
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,840
language and we agree on what the

987
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,240
inventory looks like we can then even go

988
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,620
ahead and give prioritizations to what

989
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,810
we feel like the threats are that we've

990
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,239
identified now the cool thing is is once

991
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:04,770
we know that if we all agree on what the

992
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,300
texana mean looks like over the first

993
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,220
couple years sure we're going to see

994
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,450
massive changes in the taxonomy because

995
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,070
we're all going to disagree and we're

996
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,170
gonna fight over things and as Tony

997
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,149
Sager one of the the guys that were sort

998
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:16,200
of leads a project for us at CIS talks

999
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,870
about a lot is that we're going to agree

1000
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,000
on 90% of what we're going to do in

1001
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,530
these projects but

1002
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,870
we'll also fight to the death over the

1003
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,610
remaining 10% and so there's gonna be a

1004
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,290
lot of changes as we get started but as

1005
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,729
those changes mature as we sort of

1006
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,040
decide what really needs to be in here

1007
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,490
over time we don't so much change a

1008
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,870
taxonomy as we turn dials we agree on

1009
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,880
what the attacks are what the threats

1010
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,679
might be but now we just say you know

1011
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,270
what this month at a pier sequel

1012
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,850
injection is a little bit bigger of an

1013
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:46,760
issue next month it appears that some of

1014
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,530
these scripting base applications maybe

1015
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,660
it's a PowerShell attack or pout encoded

1016
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,639
PowerShell commands that are run maybe

1017
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,290
that's more of a threat we turn those

1018
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,060
dials to target and focus on those a

1019
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,770
little bit more the point being is we

1020
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,659
could at least agree in the taxonomy we

1021
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,490
can develop defensive infrastructures to

1022
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,480
get started the nice thing is is that

1023
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,180
we're not building this in a vacuum

1024
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,500
there's a lot of good sources that are

1025
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:09,320
out there that we can take advantage of

1026
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,730
again I mentioned Anissa they've got a

1027
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,669
great effects taxonomy that they

1028
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,440
literally just released in January it's

1029
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:17,359
not quite as broad as I wish it would be

1030
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,290
but it's still really good and so I

1031
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,800
would definitely recommend you check

1032
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,840
that out

1033
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,210
mitre has always done some really good

1034
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,950
work their capex again a little focused

1035
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:26,418
but still very good work that's their

1036
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:28,158
number of other groups that are there

1037
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:29,569
general motors so again give them some

1038
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,830
credit and from this morning as well

1039
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,389
they've got a really nice threat

1040
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,469
taxonomy that they've got a few

1041
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,510
different groups that are like that out

1042
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,520
there we can define things though we can

1043
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,050
say these are the kind of agents we

1044
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,820
might figure out that are there and

1045
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:42,290
maybe can we say nation-states

1046
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,970
but we at least acknowledge that the

1047
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,949
agents are present and so we put this

1048
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:48,830
into the texana mate or we've looked at

1049
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:51,439
let's say specifically I will see the

1050
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:53,418
next slide there hopefully there we go

1051
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,879
look at some of the high-level versions

1052
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:57,170
of threat that we actually see and one

1053
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,299
of the things that we wanted to do was

1054
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,550
is a part of the scope of the project we

1055
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,940
wanted to identify was is that it's not

1056
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:07,310
just sequel injection it's not just

1057
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,080
PowerShell scripts it turns out we've

1058
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,600
identified a lot of other threats to

1059
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,060
systems that frankly may not show up as

1060
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,740
a result of a binary scan so we have

1061
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,970
some other categories of personnel based

1062
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,439
and other things that are probably worth

1063
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,750
discussing when you have a little more

1064
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,100
time we want to map those in fact in the

1065
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,360
current version we've mapping these to

1066
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,680
the threat reports to make it easier for

1067
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,930
you to go ahead and analyze the threats

1068
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,009
that are out there and it's going to be

1069
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,839
based on what we're going to consider a

1070
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,010
community based risk assessment so

1071
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,750
you're not having to come up with this

1072
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,590
on your own we want to be able to build

1073
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,600
consensus

1074
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,000
the output of this should then be

1075
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,710
controls that also you don't have to

1076
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,450
select and that's the whole point of the

1077
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,280
critical security controls v next

1078
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,740
whatever that actually ends up being we

1079
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,390
do plan on based on two things number

1080
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,399
one were calling the community attack

1081
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:51,379
model which is sort of a higher level

1082
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,760
abstraction of threat and in addition to

1083
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,710
that also some of the things were

1084
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,170
identifying in the taxonomy so we make

1085
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,060
sure we're being comprehensive in the

1086
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,800
attacks in the controls I should say on

1087
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,759
that we're putting in place again this

1088
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,110
is from the center from Internet

1089
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,240
Security for those who haven't seen this

1090
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,130
project what we're trying to do again is

1091
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,589
look at not just any potential threat

1092
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,990
but specifically the technical threats

1093
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:13,550
to systems including trying to

1094
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,799
understand some of the detective

1095
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,270
controls that we can put in place there

1096
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,370
are some side projects that are going on

1097
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,690
some we have some European intelligence

1098
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,910
agencies who have gotten together and

1099
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,640
are also doing some research on how do

1100
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,529
we take these controls look at what sort

1101
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,720
of artifacts we can detect with the

1102
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,040
sensors deployed by these controls to

1103
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,290
make again a consistent language a

1104
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,120
consistent way of reporting on some of

1105
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,400
the the threat indicators that we're

1106
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,569
discovering so there are a lot of

1107
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,590
different free open-source tools that

1108
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,810
are out there throughout models

1109
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,420
preventative detective defenses threat

1110
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:46,850
intelligence our hope is the research is

1111
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,550
done it's an opportunity now for us to

1112
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,900
act and if said another way I still love

1113
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,310
the quote from general Hayden I know a

1114
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,010
lot of you seen it but it's still one of

1115
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:56,270
my favorites quit whining act like a man

1116
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:59,000
and defend yourself

1117
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:00,470
blackout 2010 so that being said if you

1118
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,760
are interested in helping on some of

1119
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,339
these things I have to give a little bit

1120
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,500
of a plea we do really appreciate help

1121
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,880
if you have access to datasets if you're

1122
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,590
willing to share some the information

1123
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,600
that you have the only way this is

1124
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,100
successful is if we work together to

1125
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,910
share some of the intelligence some of

1126
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,370
the things that we've been collecting

1127
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,529
it's only a good project it's only a

1128
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:20,180
good tool if it's something we can truly

1129
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,400
collaborate about it can't just be that

1130
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,440
we talk about doing that so that being

1131
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,570
said my contact information is there

1132
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,310
honestly if you want to reach out we

1133
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,420
could really use the help we've got a

1134
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,220
lot of different groups they're involved

1135
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,570
already but always are willing to have

1136
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,899
more so appreciate your time on that

1137
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,900
today
