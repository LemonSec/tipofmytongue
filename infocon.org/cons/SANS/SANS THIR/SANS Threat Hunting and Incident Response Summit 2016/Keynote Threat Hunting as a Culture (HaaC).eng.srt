1
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:16,359
Wow

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:20,570
he set the bar low than you thanks Rob

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,170
does anyone know Rob's nickname it's the

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,330
mayor

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,970
so if you see Rob call him the mayor

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,198
that's because he knows everybody oh

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,689
you're supposed to set the bar low so

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,240
that I can exceed it right it's all a

9
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,710
team effort all the Intel community

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,050
stuff all carbon black everything else

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,430
it's a team effort here today to kick it

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,860
off get some energy going

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,039
I got like 45 slides to do in about 35

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,420
minutes so we'll get moving here and

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,770
excited to be here thank you two sands

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,070
thank you to all the sponsors thank you

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,780
to our team and no I'm not the Ben

18
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,230
Johnson from the 88 Olympics although I

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,000
get asked that pretty much every week if

20
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,279
you're too young he did steroids and

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,730
lost the gold medal in the 88 Olympics

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,129
uh so today's goal walking away I'm

23
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,600
thinking this is time well spent

24
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,340
thinking that you learned something I'll

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,689
try not to pace too much but I have a

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,880
lot of energy and I like walking around

27
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:17,179
I like these summits because I think the

28
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,039
term is forced reflection it's time away

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,750
from email time away from hopefully

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,070
fighting fires probably the busiest

31
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:24,290
people in the room at for your

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:25,610
respective companies and you get to

33
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,750
think about a lot of things at a

34
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,790
conference like this is something like

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,340
this I love it cuz when I go to RSA or

36
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,570
blackhat I'm typically just meeting with

37
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,479
prospects customers partners I've never

38
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,779
even seen a talk at RSA or blackhat but

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,369
I attend every year so I get to see all

40
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,290
these great talks yesterday and today

41
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:43,969
and it's been awesome so far and I

42
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,549
really look forward to the rest of the

43
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:49,100
talks today so I don't really even need

44
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:50,630
this slide because Rob showered

45
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,280
accolades that are probably not even

46
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,130
deserved - right thank you rob for

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,899
embarrassing me so I got my start at NSA

48
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:00,079
went to man tech it's missing there Fred

49
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,130
and and Henry and Rob Phil Hagan Richard

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,279
bate like all these other guys a bunch

51
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,420
of the carbon black guys oh I have a

52
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,770
couple computer science degrees I

53
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,620
usually put that up there because maybe

54
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:11,870
you guys have a connection to Johns

55
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,130
Hopkins or University of Chicago and

56
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,760
because I'm not busy enough I'm also a

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,959
luck

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,939
University of Chicago for

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,319
entrepreneurship and I'm probably

60
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,450
already connected with a lot of you on

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,530
Twitter or LinkedIn but please connect I

62
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,909
love making connections so we were

63
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,400
talking about doing shots yesterday

64
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:29,840
right Matt for buzzwords and things like

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,970
that it's a little early so maybe you

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,190
won't do shots but you'd probably do a

67
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,629
keg stand at a slide like this because

68
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,340
what's the talk without a threat scape

69
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,810
or threat landscape but really you guys

70
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,890
all know this stuff is an incredible

71
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,390
audience so what I want to point out is

72
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,439
there's all these different groups and

73
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,619
when you're thinking about responding

74
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,510
you're thinking about hunting you need

75
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,569
to think about the insider because most

76
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,190
of these groups become the insider how

77
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,708
would I hunt an insider and a lot of

78
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,989
times we don't think about that so this

79
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,540
talk is there is some concepts some

80
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,950
things for you to reflect on really

81
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,769
trying to get you to think more like a

82
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,399
hunting mindset for your team how can

83
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:13,519
you get there and maybe you're aiming

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,849
for this right pretty cool pretty cool

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,419
guys maybe related to some stuff that

86
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:23,750
Rob was talking about but maybe this is

87
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:24,769
more realistic so either you're a deer

88
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,299
in the headlights you don't really know

89
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,879
what hunting is or how you should start

90
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,379
or maybe you're an awesome hunter but I

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,940
think it was on office Heather slides or

92
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,099
someone slides where there was that list

93
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,329
of 20 things that you're doing and

94
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,910
you're tacking hunting on the end so

95
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:42,639
you're slammed so it's not necessarily

96
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:44,510
easy to get to hunting so it's hard work

97
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,040
that's why we're here we're here to

98
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,709
learn we're here to share here to unite

99
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,090
here to collaborate and really a lot of

100
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,760
the things I'm talking about for the

101
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,530
next 30 minutes are about uniting man

102
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,040
and machine together making you more

103
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,389
effective also I love the matrix and

104
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,769
this is a cool slide so I usually throw

105
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:06,669
it in there before we even get to

106
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:09,500
hunting we got to talk about farming and

107
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,180
probably no one uses this term I started

108
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,220
using it mostly in relation to this talk

109
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,608
in this conference you heard Rob mention

110
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,228
it yesterday but how can you hunt if

111
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,000
you're not even doing the farming or

112
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,709
call it triage call it response call it

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,300
some of the other work if you're not

114
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,610
doing that well how can you actually get

115
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,810
time to hunt so let's talk about this

116
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:31,670
for a few minutes

117
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:33,830
so farming are you efficient are these

118
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,960
alerts are these events just sort of

119
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,250
ripening and popping up and then you

120
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,620
just run around trying to pick them and

121
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,180
and triage them there's not a great

122
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,350
process maybe people are standing around

123
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,620
in your orgs they don't really know what

124
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:48,620
to do or even if you are a little bit

125
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,350
more efficient are you effective are you

126
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,460
working together are you all working on

127
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,270
the same thing or should you be more

128
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,250
spread out this is actually asking you

129
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,469
more questions than maybe giving you

130
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,460
answers I think it was Alex or someone

131
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,660
else talking to yesterday's like man

132
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,430
we're all asking more questions than

133
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,560
giving answers because a lot of these

134
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,120
terms a lot of these concepts are very

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,800
specific so it's more about that forced

136
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,160
reflection thinking about are we doing

137
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,010
the right things in our environment so a

138
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,250
lot of times what happens and you guys

139
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:22,580
know this better than I do are that

140
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,220
you're responding to whatever sort of

141
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,909
flames up your firefighting it's not

142
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,010
very effective and oh by the way so

143
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,380
might sort of skip this part because Rob

144
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,760
gave me such a great introduction my

145
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,530
title is chief security strategist and

146
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,930
that means I basically fire on the world

147
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,099
every week and talk to companies I've

148
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,479
done by the end of this month all have

149
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,669
done three hundred thousand miles in

150
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:45,469
twenty five months five hundred

151
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,440
organizations from US Cyber Command down

152
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,979
to you know big 12 of the fortune 20

153
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,510
down to little company so I mention that

154
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,190
because I have good perspective I think

155
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,320
I meet with so many of you and talked to

156
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,440
so many of you partners next week I'll

157
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,930
be in Denmark Holland Sweden and Dubai

158
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,340
and that's like a typical week for me it

159
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,720
might sound cool but when you do lunch

160
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,400
in Chicago dinner in Seattle and

161
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,850
breakfast in Boston in an 18-hour period

162
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,940
it's not very fun yes I've done it all

163
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,990
so anyways back to this a lot of

164
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,580
firefighting out there a lot of

165
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,590
companies are still just waiting for

166
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,020
something to pop up and you respond to

167
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:24,109
that maybe not even that efficiently or

168
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,020
effectively and you have these different

169
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,490
stages and I apologize there's a lot of

170
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,669
buzzwords in here so you can start doing

171
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,500
shots now if you want ah but there's a

172
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,539
lot of buzzwords but it's because those

173
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,090
are how we describe certain concepts

174
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,590
certain terms etc so when you have dwell

175
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,520
time and when you're responding and

176
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,400
going to this incident

177
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,750
handling incident management lifecycle

178
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,370
you have the detection stage you have

179
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,870
the response stage you have the recovery

180
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,490
stage you might use different terms but

181
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,949
you have a bunch of pieces you have to

182
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,500
do and they take too long and a lot of

183
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,180
times why we do that why it takes so

184
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,520
long is because we're collecting data

185
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,930
after the fact you know Rob mentioned

186
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,150
yesterday that forensics is kind of

187
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,770
becoming a four-letter word at least if

188
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,599
you think about the disk imaging of the

189
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,758
the full memory dumps things like that

190
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,349
because it's a human waiting for a

191
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,110
machine to do a pretty simple operation

192
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,550
it's not very efficient so you should be

193
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,560
thinking about collecting data ahead of

194
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,720
time you know we play on the end point

195
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,250
but this could be NetFlow this could be

196
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,680
full packet capture this to be proxy

197
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:26,210
logs whatever you should be collecting

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:31,940
data ahead of time because the goal here

199
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:33,888
is to shrink the overall cycle you know

200
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,340
KC gave a talk yesterday from from first

201
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:39,650
bank he doesn't set the camera up after

202
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,520
the robbery he sets it up ahead of time

203
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:43,460
you know what questions you're gonna

204
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,780
have during triage during response make

205
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,180
sure you can answer them and not only

206
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,679
that and I love this quote response is

207
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,460
the closest thing we have in IT

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,960
to dogfighting by the way go watch Bruce

209
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,789
Schneier is blackhat 2014 recording from

210
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,580
from YouTube or something that's a great

211
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,139
talk he said this and it's so right

212
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,370
you're having to move quickly you're

213
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,279
having a fight and by the way Thank You

214
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,360
JD I had to put pictures of jets here

215
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:15,680
because people thought it was actual

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,060
dogs fighting never crossed my mind

217
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,840
until people started asking about it I'm

218
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:26,779
like no no not Michael Vick Top Gun so

219
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:29,090
so yeah so it's it's it's a fight right

220
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,909
it's it's dog fight but it's even worse

221
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,289
than that because remember the insider

222
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,689
quick little sentence I saw I talked

223
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,309
about you have to hunt for insiders

224
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,630
they're doing this they're blending in

225
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,978
they're living off the land or you might

226
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,659
call it the outsider insider problem you

227
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,010
might have your own terminology but they

228
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,810
get credentials and what are they they

229
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,970
become an employee or they use things

230
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,979
like PowerShell whimmy all these other

231
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,329
tools they're not necessarily using

232
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,910
these cyber super weapons of these

233
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,380
malicious binaries and this doesn't

234
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,420
necessarily new

235
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,220
sorry target I know everyone kind of

236
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,050
feels bad by now for picking on target

237
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,560
but if you look at the target report it

238
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:07,160
says attackers mostly used IT specific

239
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,589
tools protocols and procedures seldom do

240
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,410
they use hacker specific tools and

241
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,940
malware they just had their RAM scraping

242
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,810
malware and they mostly used the system

243
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,040
administrator tools and the

244
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,050
infrastructure to push that out to all

245
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,219
the point-of-sale and that's just one

246
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,310
example but that's happening all the

247
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,200
time so it makes response and eventually

248
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,699
when we talk about hunting more harder

249
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,870
because you're looking for the insider

250
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,250
you're looking for the guy that looks

251
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,430
like your buddy but really it's not your

252
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,980
buddy and so when you start thinking

253
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,510
about this you have to look at so much

254
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,250
more activity so much more beneath the

255
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,930
surface so instead of just looking at a

256
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,670
binary is this good or bad and making a

257
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,849
decision we all have seen how that works

258
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,640
on the a/v side you have to think about

259
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,260
what's going on in your environment like

260
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,660
what's going on once that binary runs or

261
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,850
once that user logs in can you look for

262
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,520
abnormal behavior can you look for

263
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,930
account compromise can you look for

264
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,860
lateral movement data exfil and I could

265
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,540
go on and on because you don't know

266
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,860
everything bad ahead of time and that's

267
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,939
really why we're hunting if we knew

268
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,500
everything bad ahead of time we would

269
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:15,560
not have jobs we would just plug

270
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:17,390
something in and walk away but you can't

271
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,300
forget about IT you can't forget about

272
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,150
your posture and really IT hygiene I

273
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,319
can't stress this enough is your

274
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:33,170
environment like this or like this is

275
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,580
anyone's environment like this no be

276
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,540
awesome if it was but this is what

277
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,190
you're aiming for because if it's like

278
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,709
this when you're starting to look for

279
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,270
anomalies who's going out of turn who's

280
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,230
doing the wrong thing who's sitting in

281
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,640
the middle of the intersection because

282
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:46,700
that's not normal or not allowed by law

283
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,290
well everyone is so you got to think

284
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,810
about your gold images think about where

285
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,579
the entropy exists and try to get here

286
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,829
so that when the car goes perpendicular

287
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,560
to the rest of the pack or in this case

288
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,260
your activity looks very different

289
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,939
that's where you can focus that's gonna

290
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,010
save you time remember this whole notion

291
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,780
of farming or response or triage that's

292
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,060
going to save you time

293
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,560
and so if you start thinking about you

294
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,050
know pulling data together a dog

295
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,489
fighting in environments you have to

296
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,099
start thinking about how do you craft

297
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,720
what humans see when you're doing

298
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,360
response farming whatever you want to

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:27,810
call it so kind of the old way of just

300
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,160
doing forensics sorry Rob or you know

301
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,380
just once in a while looking for

302
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,110
something it's not ideal

303
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,880
so people are switching to continuous

304
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,800
recording and this could be endpoint

305
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,710
this could be net flow full packet

306
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,050
capture proxy logs user credential usage

307
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,270
etc whatever it is you're trying to

308
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,800
collect more data and I think that was a

309
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,720
theme yesterday's you need data to be

310
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,510
able to hunt this is really still

311
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,520
talking about response and detection but

312
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,610
you need data to hunt but you don't stop

313
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,170
there you add threat intelligence and

314
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,960
feel free to do shots anytime I say any

315
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,969
of these words you need reputation

316
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,750
information someone thinks that your

317
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:08,160
human should start on the dark red dot

318
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,920
hey at least that's that's better than

319
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,709
not knowing where to start but don't

320
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:17,130
stop there either make it specific to

321
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,900
your environment is it prevalent is it

322
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,089
frequent is it rare we saw some things

323
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,220
yesterday show me files that only exist

324
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,100
on one domain controller out of 200 that

325
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,300
kind of information is critical but you

326
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,870
don't stop there either you go to the

327
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,359
relationship level if I see an unknown

328
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,180
binary but every single thing it's doing

329
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,880
is known good I can prioritize that for

330
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:41,189
my team below an unknown binary doing

331
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,740
unknown things or a known good binary

332
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,080
like PS exact PowerShell etc doing

333
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,130
suspicious things because all about how

334
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,030
do you save time so that you can

335
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,990
eventually hunt so instead of just

336
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,300
thinking about like the old-school

337
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,770
forensics or memory dumps or offline

338
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,770
analysis you got to start thinking about

339
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,680
the bank security camera and what am I

340
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,079
really talking about here context I

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,640
think we heard this yesterday as well

342
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,500
you got to have context it's so

343
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,030
important hey FTP is running in my

344
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,550
environment oh great it runs all the

345
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:13,290
time no no F T P is running on my head

346
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,180
of hrs machine spawned by PowerShell

347
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:20,699
okay that changed the equation so when

348
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,310
you start thinking about your posture

349
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,140
your security stack there's this flag

350
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,510
from like the Revolutionary War times

351
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,310
where the colonies in the US were

352
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,650
uniting together and saying look we got

353
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,849
to join together or die that's really

354
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,100
what we got to think about when we talk

355
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,390
about our stack our security stack this

356
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,760
could be more than just technology this

357
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,770
could be team this could be cross across

358
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,560
your team's but we got to join together

359
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,140
or die but it's beyond that I think I

360
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,550
saw this hashtag yesterday so you know

361
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,010
feel free to do another shot or a keg

362
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:52,620
stand or something but it's really

363
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:55,380
Automator die because the numbers are

364
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,690
too great there's too much going on none

365
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,120
of you can find people when Google is

366
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,570
having a hard time hiring good luck to

367
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,300
the rest of us right and it's not just

368
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,710
this notion of automate it's people like

369
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,339
DARPA who's doing a lot of

370
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:12,770
forward-thinking cyber research and

371
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:19,140
saying only automation can change cyber

372
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:21,480
economics so you see new spaces popping

373
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,920
up things like orchestration and yes I

374
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,080
said I would use a lot of buzzwords but

375
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,550
you see things like orchestration puffs

376
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,950
popping up and you should be thinking

377
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,689
about these kind of concepts so instead

378
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,230
of an alert coming from a point solution

379
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,930
and going straight to an analyst we're

380
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,330
seeing how well that works

381
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,770
remember context you add context but in

382
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,810
a more automated way so you

383
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,550
automatically rip out attributes from

384
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,560
that alert check it against your threat

385
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,300
feeds what's the history of this device

386
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,010
we've all heard the term analytics and

387
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,380
things like that recently right because

388
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,340
is this common for this device to be

389
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:59,640
doing this behavior who's the user is

390
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,620
that the CFO or the intern if I see me

391
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,210
me cats run on the CEOs machine or I see

392
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,000
it on the threat research threat

393
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:08,310
researchers machine that's a different

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,690
severity level I should probably check

395
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,439
both but I'm definitely jumping out of

396
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,790
bed on Christmas to fix the CEOs machine

397
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,340
so finally what comes out and enriched

398
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,770
alert enrichment another buzzword and

399
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,940
then finally that hits a human and then

400
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,710
if you have the right information you

401
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,140
have the right context you can make a

402
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,660
much more informed decision about your

403
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,400
remediation are you reimaging or can you

404
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,280
be more tactical and do things like

405
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,620
block ip's kill processes preserve

406
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,020
evidence may be reset credentials

407
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,300
much more automated way because remember

408
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:48,180
the point the point is to save time so

409
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:50,130
you can spend more time hunting but you

410
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,689
can't just think of automation as the

411
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,390
saving grace you have to have an

412
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,400
automated process that's already

413
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,880
effective so I love this quote from Bill

414
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,380
Gates

415
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,630
you know automation applied to an

416
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,400
efficient operation magnifies the

417
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,050
efficiency and conversely if it's

418
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,760
inefficient it magnifies the

419
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,890
inefficiency you can't just have the

420
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,930
messy traffic jam and throw some

421
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,060
automation in there and you're good you

422
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,620
still have to do some of the blocking

423
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,900
and tackling for another another shot

424
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:20,340
there you have to still have effective

425
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,530
security teams effective security stack

426
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,240
and then you automate that to really

427
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,220
magnify their efficiency

428
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,150
remember forced reflection thinking

429
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,860
about some of this stuff some of you

430
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,090
might be already doing all this but you

431
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,580
need to be thinking about it either way

432
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:39,360
and so this one tech company - security

433
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,160
engineers 20 to 30 alerts per day they

434
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,300
were manually processing 4 to 6 alerts

435
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,469
or would usually take him a couple hours

436
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,020
to pull together all the data sources

437
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,390
time - resolution was about 5 to 10 days

438
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,000
so they reached out and they they got

439
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,699
from Netflix open sourced something

440
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,260
called phyto fully integrated defense

441
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,360
operations I think it's kind of like the

442
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,780
dog name you should go look at it look

443
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,210
at it

444
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,520
so this tech company integrated that and

445
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,120
after they integrated that the same two

446
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:08,460
security engineers we're processing 50

447
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,250
to 200 alerts per day so they increased

448
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,870
their alert count but they did it in a

449
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,089
much more automated way and the time

450
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:16,379
resolution was under an hour and they

451
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,540
said look this allows us to add

452
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,010
additional detection and additional

453
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,230
pieces of our security stack to cover

454
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,700
gaps without headcount and really it

455
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,400
boils down to it's easier to buy

456
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,810
technology than to find people so you

457
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,530
have to really unite that man and

458
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,629
machine in an effective way and so if

459
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,649
you think about your security stack you

460
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,150
should think about it maybe a little

461
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,420
differently not just like network end

462
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,490
point you know DNS proxy credentials you

463
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,020
know whatever maybe think about a little

464
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,590
bit differently so you start with

465
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,790
something like visibility can't stop

466
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,090
what you can't see right you can't hunt

467
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,250
if you

468
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,899
have something to look at so you start

469
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,309
with visibility then you really start

470
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,870
working on triage this could be

471
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:56,158
potentially farming if you want to use

472
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,360
that term which I don't think will catch

473
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,809
on but if you want to make it catch on

474
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,330
go for it then you do things like IOC is

475
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:04,918
but in an automated way pump in tons of

476
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,070
them but try to do an automated way and

477
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,710
then again what's a summit day without a

478
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,939
pyramid of pain reference but you move

479
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,659
up the pyramid of pain you do things

480
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,580
like pattern based detection column

481
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:19,740
TTP's calling pattern of compromised

482
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,899
pattern of attack whatever but it's

483
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,590
moving beyond like hashes and IPS and

484
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:27,469
things like that then you do it you add

485
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,459
to capability to do it retrospectively

486
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,720
hey I just learned about some new

487
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,070
technique let me go see if this has

488
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,870
happened in my environment the last six

489
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:38,850
months so I don't have to wait for

490
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,928
something to flag it integrate lean on

491
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,908
your vendors if you don't have

492
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,370
connectors between different pieces of

493
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,429
your stack lean on us lean on on all of

494
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,260
your vendors build them yourself most

495
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,840
products now have AP is and then

496
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,610
automate really work this into your team

497
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,559
your workflow try to automate things if

498
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,539
an alert comes in and there's a domain

499
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,279
net alert and your human is ripping out

500
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,899
that domain going to a site pasting it

501
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,850
and seeing how old that domain is that

502
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:07,289
is very inefficient and does not require

503
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:09,959
a human mind and then finally finally we

504
00:19:07,289 --> 00:19:12,270
get to hunting but people try to skip

505
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,289
the whole whole stack here and go

506
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,668
straight to hunting if you think about

507
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,899
martial arts it's like the white belt on

508
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,610
the bottom and the black belt the top

509
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:21,479
people just try to jump into hunting

510
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:28,559
that's all we're gonna do if we do jump

511
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:30,270
in hunting so hunting but are we really

512
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,470
wrestling we try to do a hunting

513
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,690
expedition and you spend most of the

514
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,149
time you finally get some couple hours

515
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,270
to hunt quote-unquote hunt you spend the

516
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:44,100
whole time wrestling with your tools

517
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:45,149
things like that or maybe you are a

518
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,559
little bit better than that but you

519
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:48,600
don't really have a plan you're kind of

520
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,270
just like willy-nilly going at it you

521
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,918
know again maybe another keg stand what

522
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,960
would a talk be with another Sun zoo

523
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,080
quote but you know if you don't have

524
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,830
strategy and you just have tactics not

525
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,949
necessarily going to be victorious or

526
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,000
maybe

527
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,909
our hunting and you're doing it really

528
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:11,130
well but it's based on these super

529
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:12,510
humans what happens if they're on

530
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,649
vacation what happens if they quit what

531
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:23,850
happens if Google steals them not very

532
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:25,709
scalable so we're too reliant here so

533
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,629
we're talking about farming and speed

534
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,139
well hunting is the same way it's all

535
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,909
about speed you need that creative time

536
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:35,100
but you need to be able to track down

537
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,120
leads pull those threads quickly

538
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,049
otherwise you're just going to go off

539
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,840
you're going to get bored and you're

540
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:43,260
gonna stop hunting and go back to

541
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,820
looking at the sin so a good decision

542
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,039
today is better than a great decision 48

543
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,269
hours now I just love this quote but if

544
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
you think about the military and you

545
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,820
know rob is talking about some of the

546
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,220
cool stuff we used to do so there's a

547
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,658
lot of sort of military tie-in but you

548
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,429
know the OODA loop again probably

549
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,779
another shot for a lot of you what's the

550
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:00,539
cyber talk without the OODA loop but

551
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,850
this notion from 1966 from dog fighting

552
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,908
that in dog fighting whoever can go

553
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,039
through the OODA loop fastest is going

554
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,169
to be victorious you can observe the

555
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:12,299
enemy you can orient the overall

556
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:13,860
situation decide what to do an act

557
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,049
whoever can do that fastest is going to

558
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,189
win and it's like that in hunting you'd

559
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,889
be able to figure out what thread is

560
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,600
worthy of spending more time on because

561
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:23,729
you don't have enough people but it's

562
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,980
not just from 1966 and I'm actually

563
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,490
shocked at how little I found tie in

564
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:32,340
between the new Special Forces JSOC you

565
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:35,100
know approach and cyber so we were

566
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:40,080
totally getting our asses kicked in Iraq

567
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:41,969
in 2003 time for a and 2004 and so JSOC

568
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,460
Joint Special Operations Command under

569
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,080
general McChrystal said look we got to

570
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,409
embrace this this new way of doing

571
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,570
things so it's called feed f3 EAD find

572
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:53,340
fix finish exploit analyze disseminate

573
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,668
and as soon as we started doing this is

574
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,049
physical you know military units we were

575
00:21:56,669 --> 00:22:00,600
successful but I think it really applies

576
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:03,840
where you're trying to blend ops and

577
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,389
Intel in a much more tight circle much

578
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,470
faster feedback loop so find is really

579
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:11,610
identifying who you're going after and

580
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,049
especially in the physical world fixes

581
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,299
fixate their position figure out where

582
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,869
they are finish is cap

583
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:21,149
surekill exploit in the real world is

584
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:21,720
really try to grab as much from them as

585
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:23,399
you can

586
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,899
phones hard drives things like that you

587
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:27,508
probably seen zero dark thirty and stuff

588
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:29,488
like that analyzed actually try to get

589
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,169
actionable information out of that and

590
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:33,360
really disseminate make sure that goes

591
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:35,070
back into the team as fast as possible

592
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,570
if you think about cyber this is what

593
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,860
you're trying to do to when you're

594
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,439
hunting and you're getting those leads

595
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,908
you need to start really figuring out is

596
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,649
this useful and how fast can I get this

597
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,759
maybe your hunting as a team right we're

598
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:47,039
trying to get our culture to be more

599
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,480
like hunting can I get this to the rest

600
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,649
of the team faster than they can maybe

601
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,100
investigate that because I want to go

602
00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:55,049
back to this other lead and maybe a new

603
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,820
metric we all need new metrics and cyber

604
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,039
right meantime to capture a kill

605
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,629
I think that's a good one maybe it's

606
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,720
mean time to containment or eradication

607
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:06,029
but you got to think about this but it's

608
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,039
not just military so I mentioned I I

609
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:09,029
teach entrepreneurship well if any of

610
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,809
you familiar with the Lean Startup

611
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:14,190
methodology that's another example so

612
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,320
Lean Startup doesn't necessarily mean

613
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,090
you don't spend money it means you learn

614
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,340
lessons about your business venture as

615
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:26,220
fast as possible so you haven't

616
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,918
hypothesis you measure if it's gonna

617
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,659
work and then you learn from it you know

618
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,159
Dropbox set up a website they didn't

619
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,919
even have a product they set up a

620
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,749
website explaining Dropbox and they said

621
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,919
hey sign up if you want to if you want

622
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,799
this if you think this is good they just

623
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,999
had a site with a little box that said

624
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,289
put your email animal let you know when

625
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,789
it's ready they had not even developed

626
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,139
the product yet seventy five thousand

627
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:47,970
people signed up like the first day like

628
00:23:46,139 --> 00:23:49,769
alright cool we're gonna build it so

629
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,570
they did very minimal work and they

630
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:54,029
learned that yes this is a viable option

631
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,029
for our business but it's the same thing

632
00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:01,019
how fast can you track down that thing

633
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:02,850
you're hunting that lead I have a new

634
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,679
gut feeling let me go check it but can I

635
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,600
check it as a as efficient and as

636
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:11,059
effective as possible you want to

637
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,678
minimize the time so when you're hunting

638
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:15,389
it's not just about finding apt or

639
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,609
finding bad guys or finding malware

640
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:21,539
there are so many other outcomes that

641
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:23,999
can come from a hunting expedition where

642
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,119
to hunt so maybe at the very end of your

643
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:28,830
quote-unquote hunting expedition the

644
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,059
outcome is oh I'm going to start

645
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,939
here next time and have a much higher

646
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,820
success rate or chance of success what -

647
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,409
Han maybe at the very end of your

648
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,760
hunting expedition you're like man I'm

649
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,140
seeing a whole lot of weird PowerShell

650
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,460
here I didn't see anything but I really

651
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,190
want to go back and investigate this or

652
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,890
or with me or weird weird account usage

653
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,600
patterns but I don't have time to keep

654
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:52,190
going there so where to hunt but then

655
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,299
also where are my gaps

656
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,519
maybe you're finding malicious or

657
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:58,620
suspicious binaries and your team

658
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,120
figures out you're very inefficient at

659
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,229
reverse engineering them or detonating

660
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,570
them or doing whatever you want with

661
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,980
them so you're finding gaps ok I got to

662
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,299
fix my team where are my strengths and

663
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,710
how are we getting better you know Oh

664
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,049
last time this guy was really slow at

665
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,880
doing this now he's really good awesome

666
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:18,720
these are great pieces of feedback great

667
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,919
feedback loops and then finally what's

668
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,010
one of the major problems with our

669
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,440
environments today and Casey gets credit

670
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,629
for this I love this term its deploy and

671
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,269
decay that happens all the time in our

672
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:32,940
environments we buy tools we set up logs

673
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,860
whatever we don't give him the care and

674
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,029
feeding so over time they decay instead

675
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,229
of getting better instead of being

676
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:41,760
optimized they decay so in doing your

677
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,559
hunting and exploring where you might

678
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,940
not normally explore may be like oh man

679
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,250
we're really not capturing the proper

680
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,510
logs here

681
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,830
we're not correlating them well together

682
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:51,658
you know we talked about Canaries and

683
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:53,070
things like that yesterday where do I

684
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:56,279
need more care and feeding that can be

685
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:59,939
an outcome so instead of having a blind

686
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:02,340
reactive posture you should be really

687
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,889
figuring out where should humans hunt

688
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,389
and where should I spend my time this is

689
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:09,510
a forest fire map thinking about the

690
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:11,309
fire analogy I'm not going to send my

691
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,019
forest fires to New England I'm gonna

692
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,690
send them to the the Great Plains and

693
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:17,370
maybe over to California and Nevada it's

694
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,230
the same way can you carve off can you

695
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:20,879
group parts of your environment and

696
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,490
basically automate everything or lock

697
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,080
them down so that your humans don't

698
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:29,519
really have to spend any time there and

699
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,370
then go hunt in the nasty stuff and if

700
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:34,260
you think about actual data these are

701
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,389
processes and the domains they connect

702
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,179
to and the affinity between them so how

703
00:26:36,389 --> 00:26:41,428
similar they are see that blue cluster

704
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,290
at the top see that green cluster in the

705
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,660
lower left

706
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:49,100
those are servers they're a lot cleaner

707
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:52,490
that met that mess in the middle that's

708
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,590
your employee population but even there

709
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,270
I could kind of carve off the right side

710
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,928
that's mostly green there's little

711
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,129
clusters of pink purple I shouldn't

712
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:03,169
really spend much time hunting there

713
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,910
that should be clean enough that I can

714
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:06,950
really focus on automation and

715
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,740
technology to alert me when something's

716
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:16,910
anomalous or bad and the hunting goes in

717
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:19,580
the middle so wrapping up so it's all

718
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,350
about humans it's all about humans and

719
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,809
really if you think about iti like to

720
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,250
think about IT as a bridge IT builds a

721
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,960
bridge and it's all about what uptime

722
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,890
and availability so IT sort of sits

723
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,350
underneath and make sure it doesn't

724
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,850
collapse but Security's the opposite

725
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,899
it's kind of like those special forces

726
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,990
guys you saw in the photo

727
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:38,090
it's about strong people with technology

728
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,790
making them more effective so you have

729
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,639
to enable your team to make these fast

730
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,379
decisions do these quick loops to feed

731
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,799
the OODA loops Lean Startup all these

732
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,540
different examples and this was probably

733
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,210
definitely B or this would definitely be

734
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,649
keg stand time right comprar compromises

735
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,290
inevitable does anyone never heard that

736
00:27:54,650 --> 00:28:00,760
before so has anyone heard it over a

737
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,840
hundred times probably a thousand times

738
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,090
it's because the attacker only has to be

739
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,830
successful once but the defender has to

740
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,600
stop 100% of attacks and it's even worse

741
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,490
than that because your own really

742
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,230
gullibility level of your employees also

743
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,470
as a factor so you're kind of defending

744
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:17,570
against the bad guy and your team but we

745
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:21,080
don't think about this enough once

746
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,879
they're in your environment the attacker

747
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,879
should have to be a hundred percent

748
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,040
perfect so what you're trying to do is

749
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,220
set up your system setup your detection

750
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,770
raise that bar and get as close to 100%

751
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,290
as possible and get that gap between

752
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,500
where you're at and 100% that's what

753
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:41,659
hunting is it's finding that gap between

754
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,270
where technology stops and where's a

755
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:49,010
hundred percent effectiveness that's

756
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:50,750
hunting and so we talked about these

757
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,179
layers and you saw this I think as well

758
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,070
yesterday it has to feed everything has

759
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,090
to feed back when you are doing hunting

760
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,520
and you find interesting

761
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,549
things put those in to your detection

762
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,830
rules do IOC OCS add behavioral patterns

763
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:09,830
figure out your gaps you improve triage

764
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:16,730
or improve retrospection so are you

765
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:19,399
aiming for this well I hope you are but

766
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,480
actually we can aim for better so if

767
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,919
you're talking about uniting man and

768
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:37,029
machine together she really be thinking

769
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:37,029
about intelligence and drones Thanks
