1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:16,260
check one two

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,910
awesome alright so set the stage a

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,080
little bit here before I get going

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,189
this talk is gonna be a little bit

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,650
different than what we've had up to this

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,509
point where it's gonna be a little bit

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,369
to the deep dive into a couple things a

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,699
little bit into the weeds

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,380
if scares you a little bit feel free to

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,820
pick up your phone I'm not going to be

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,269
offended by that

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,050
I'm more of a tactical person I'm not

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:42,420
high level strategy I'm not a marketing

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,680
product type of things so that's where

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,800
this talk is going to be kind of heading

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,100
is more of a tactical side of things so

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Who I am

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,590
I work for blue code systems I am on a

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,690
red team resource they're looking at our

20
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,360
products and internal networks and

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,059
things like that so I come at this from

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,969
an offensive side of things previously I

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,250
was a security researcher for them my

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,900
background my undergrad is in software

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,040
engineering so that's kind of the world

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,030
that I live in that's what I really

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,670
enjoy I'm a graduate from sans is a

28
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,990
master's degree program among other

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,380
things that means I have a whole lot of

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,179
certs if anyone has questions about that

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,890
program I'm more than willing to to

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,680
answer them people to look in the

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,340
program it's the one to consider along

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,280
with some others out there so what I

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,530
hope you get from this talk I hope you

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,880
understand some of the anomalies

37
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,290
specifically - we've Lee and I'll

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,079
explain what we've Lee is here in a

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,369
second but also web shells and again

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,100
I'll define that a little bit in case

41
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,229
you're not familiar with it some of the

42
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,729
common themes when you're hunting web

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,658
shells what might make those different

44
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:55,170
than Metasploit or more traditional rat

45
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,790
and then a bulk of the talk is actually

46
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:02,430
going to be dissecting the the situ of

47
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,409
weebly and while that might seem like

48
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,210
it's a little bit in the weeds for a

49
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,530
conference that's talking about threats

50
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,480
honey as a whole from a point of looking

51
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,650
for things that is very useful to get an

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,119
idea of what

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,760
tools are doing out there what the

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,349
artifacts are and one of the things I

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,599
hope you'll get is some ideas of what to

56
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:28,829
hunt for based upon this some of those

57
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,869
anomalies but also a little bit of an

58
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,420
itch to dig into some of these tools out

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,069
there and figure out what they do you

60
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,790
can wait for the IOC s to come to you

61
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,440
from somebody else or you can get some

62
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,879
of these tools that are open-source out

63
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,129
there they don't mimic things perfectly

64
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,420
and you can start seeing what is odd

65
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,649
what are those Canaries what are those

66
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,190
things are gonna be a little weird for

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,359
you last point is to just kind of accept

68
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,390
the fact that I don't have a graphic

69
00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:00,629
bone in me these slides are very basic

70
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,190
I'm not a mean person so you're not

71
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:07,950
gonna see any laughing cats or anything

72
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:10,890
like that at the end of it I'll have the

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,200
URL for the github repo as well now are

74
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,358
you an apology I messed up last night

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,310
when I went to push this out I realized

76
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,440
that the most recent artifacts are on my

77
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,940
lab computer which I did not bring with

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,459
me I guarantee I will get those up

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,870
before the end of the week I'll explain

80
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,200
what's going to be on there and why that

81
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:32,370
might be abused to you all right

82
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,950
so bucks io C's are only a hint and so

83
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,019
special before context is key it's

84
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,388
important to understand where these iOS

85
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,629
es really fit into your network you have

86
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:44,940
to understand your network your systems

87
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,480
to be able to identify the things that

88
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,489
are odd

89
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,590
other words we talk about baseline and

90
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,750
everything for me it's much more general

91
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,510
what is it you would expect to have on

92
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,040
your system intellectually do you expect

93
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,730
to have Linux systems coming from this

94
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,310
subnet do you expect internal web

95
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:06,238
traffic from this network to another

96
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,620
network do you expect to have users that

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
are working tonight those type of things

98
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,910
yes those things can be baseline yes

99
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,500
lessons can be monitored but we have to

100
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,440
have that context we have to be able to

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,230
wrap this into an understanding and a

102
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,430
framework web shells

103
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,990
are a little bit different than rats in

104
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,020
the sense that they're a file that is

105
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,110
going to get dropped in a web server

106
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,109
that is going to receive commands and

107
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,120
execute them these are so they're

108
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,190
typically very small they're not a whole

109
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,980
command and control with tons of logic

110
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,150
that can be just a couple lines and

111
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,980
they're gonna get a command from

112
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,810
somewhere they're usually system command

113
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:49,600
so LS copy IP config ifconfig create

114
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,460
users things like that so it's a system

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,850
command coming in that takes advantage

116
00:04:51,460 --> 00:05:00,700
of the language to run it on the system

117
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,590
under the context of the web server so

118
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,240
that means if you have one of these

119
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,909
things dropped and it receives a command

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,420
to create a file it's going to try to

121
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,870
execute it and create the file we've Lee

122
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:17,530
is open-source it's part of Kali

123
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,630
it is a PHP web shot which means it's

124
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,539
going to work on servers that have PHP

125
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,460
installed which could be is again one of

126
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:29,280
those context things do you expect PHP

127
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:33,000
on is servers the back end is I thought

128
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,239
the neck okay I'll talk later

129
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,350
has lots and lots of custom ility to it

130
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,790
so I'm going to show you guys the

131
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,770
default on the command and control but

132
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,460
the author when he wrote this did a very

133
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,770
good job of making so the template that

134
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,120
is used to help fisca the dropper the

135
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,510
web shell on the web server can be

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,660
changed the encryption corruption that's

137
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,510
used on the C - traffic can also be

138
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,980
modified so you can't necessarily take

139
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,050
what I show you and say yes I now

140
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,630
understand we've Lee perfectly but it

141
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:11,650
can give some ideas of okay this is what

142
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:14,230
I might be wanting to look for thank you

143
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,810
thinking there we go

144
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,740
so white actors might use web shells

145
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,360
network connections are not always

146
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,100
active it's just sitting there it's

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,900
waiting for something to come in that

148
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,360
means in less than once talking to it

149
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,590
it's passive on your network it's going

150
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,910
to blend in with an existing traffic

151
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:34,060
these are communicating over HTTP backup

152
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,730
access so one of the things that I think

153
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,400
they have a lot of advantage for is you

154
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,600
put a web show and those a server and

155
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,750
allows you to get access to at a later

156
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,370
date it may not be as nifty even as

157
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,020
stealthy as you want maybe not as full

158
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,430
powered but it's another way for you to

159
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,930
get into somebody else might not look

160
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,180
for because it's not always talking and

161
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,970
they get often dropped through web app

162
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,190
loaner abilities so it may be an entry

163
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,770
point things for the defenders to

164
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,870
consider internal versus external facing

165
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,219
web servers production versus just there

166
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,530
do you have developers that are running

167
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,300
Apache on their servers on their

168
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,770
workstations for testing or whether web

169
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,050
shells are a way to drop that and get in

170
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,109
there yes you could detect these be it

171
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,180
via post integrity you know what files

172
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,500
are actually on your web servers if you

173
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,530
even know where all your web servers are

174
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,630
and do you know if something changes

175
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,669
there are you even monitoring internal

176
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:26,050
web traffic are you keeping track of

177
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,060
what things are going in there and

178
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,020
whether you're doing blood flows net

179
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,150
flows versus full capture capture

180
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,010
central tip-offs so we've li is very

181
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,750
talking most web shells if they're

182
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:44,200
setting up a continual traffic are very

183
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,280
talkative post integrity and there's

184
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,080
gonna be something that catches your eye

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,440
and we'll get into that here at this

186
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,060
point

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,390
so we've league isolated was very

188
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:56,530
talkative so this was generated from a

189
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,150
peak app backing up so I have what I'll

190
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,130
give you guys is a peak app that shows

191
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,109
the attack traffic that I was using is

192
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,460
this kind of case study so you guys can

193
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,420
go back through and dig into this if it

194
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,820
is an interest to you

195
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,970
this is generated with tea shark huge

196
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,940
fan of tea shark so what this is showing

197
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:18,820
is we have two requests from one IP to

198
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:21,790
another there 0.0 0.1 at same host 0.02

199
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,730
ovo 2-3 seconds later maybe have another

200
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:27,520
request and if you look through the

201
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,009
communication this is going on fairly

202
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,840
consistently and then though we break

203
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:35,409
that's abnormal we shouldn't be seeing

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,240
would be unlikely to be seen context of

205
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,958
your environment something like that

206
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,250
happening I put these in a couple

207
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,979
different places I don't expect you guys

208
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,899
to memorize them something to point out

209
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,610
that a lot of people may not always know

210
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,589
is this T fields allows you to specify

211
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,600
what kind of output you want coming from

212
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:55,360
T sharks you can say I only want these

213
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,690
fields and newer versions of T shark has

214
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,160
this : info which is what you would see

215
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,930
in the description field of Wireshark

216
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,880
very useful when you're doing grep type

217
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,859
things all right so here's one of the

218
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,649
requests going out couldn't show up

219
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,930
great now a couple things jump out to me

220
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,700
right away

221
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,199
except language header is I'm making

222
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,110
this request I would prefer to have it

223
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,700
back in this language if possible the

224
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:27,160
user agent do you expect to have that

225
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,750
version of Windows and opera from 2007

226
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,350
running on your network should be a red

227
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:36,640
flag for you and then the refer so

228
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,839
Google that CF and the query was 168 so

229
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,550
let's fix that back and put this in

230
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,829
context whether this is in your DMZ

231
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,890
whether this is internal system we have

232
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:45,609
a request going to a web server

233
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,600
supposedly they're getting there because

234
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:52,180
they have googled the South African

235
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Republic I remember correctly x' version

236
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,000
of google with the query 168 somehow

237
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,290
that magically gets to your server

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,709
they're using an english version of

239
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:06,130
opera from 2008 however they prefer to

240
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:07,869
have it in an african dialect if that's

241
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,810
not possible in Indian dialect if that's

242
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,240
not possible a nordic language and I am

243
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:15,130
blanking on what SMS at the moment but

244
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,480
the point being there's discrepancies

245
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,350
there's something really kind of fishy

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,779
about this G shark here again slides

247
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:27,310
later except language what is it this is

248
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:28,779
spitting out all of the accept languages

249
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,729
so I'm taking this peak app that I put

250
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:32,380
in for whatever reason you decide to do

251
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,940
full capture between these systems maybe

252
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,320
you have it great and I'm just saying

253
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,880
hey give me all the accept languages

254
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,680
that are going on there

255
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,230
so here are sampling if some of these

256
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,930
things happen this P cap is between

257
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,220
three and five minutes long

258
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,589
all these are the different request

259
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,630
languages that we've Lee has requested

260
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:54,670
going on here in total there were 101

261
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,079
unique accept language headers within

262
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,839
that time period that should be a red

263
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,638
flag particularly if your site being

264
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:08,259
external or internal doesn't offer

265
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:10,449
localization in that form so user agents

266
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,069
I love user agents for hunting again

267
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,479
comes down to context what you expect in

268
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,969
your network what do you expect to see

269
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,160
maybe you can't differentiate between

270
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,870
what is a valid and invalid version but

271
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,709
maybe you can identify the fact that I

272
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,339
probably shouldn't have n t51 systems on

273
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:28,229
my network

274
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,230
something's bogus one way or the other

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,490
ninety-eight use your unique user agents

276
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:37,939
in there right I need to speed alright

277
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,430
response response coming back now things

278
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:42,050
are clearly even more weird this is not

279
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,790
what we typically see for an HTML

280
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,889
response we have a weird tag and what

281
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,889
looks to be base64 encoded data in there

282
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,300
taking that a step further I don't

283
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,559
expect you guys to read this it actually

284
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,189
is purposely up there to make your eyes

285
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,809
gloss over you go and you retrieve the

286
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:02,059
PHP file but all these things are going

287
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,009
to you've got weirdness to it this is

288
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,839
part of what it starts to look like the

289
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,180
PHP at the top is what's indicating this

290
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,009
is code that's going to get executed the

291
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,949
point of this callosum over is the fact

292
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,720
that it has to do state itself it has to

293
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:16,639
be able undo what's there same with

294
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,540
Packers and malware it has to be able to

295
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,800
unravel itself which means we can I'm

296
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,480
not going to walk through all of it you

297
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,699
guys would completely hate me by the end

298
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,559
of it but a couple snippets here just

299
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,479
basic string replace just things to make

300
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,089
our life a little bit more miserable but

301
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,559
easy to undo another one here where

302
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,589
we're concatenated all these strings

303
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:38,000
together and we're replacing this

304
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,170
parenthesis if your eyes were really

305
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,490
good at finding patterns you might have

306
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,680
noticed this that appeared a lot in that

307
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,910
other screen remove them altogether and

308
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,800
that create function we had before we're

309
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:50,600
creating the function we're taking this

310
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,370
that was all competitive together to

311
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
make code that we're gonna then execute

312
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,209
this is where the web shell comes in

313
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,970
it's going to say execute and run this

314
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:04,540
as our execute all right if we undo this

315
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,779
at the top that mess now comes up with

316
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:09,889
two parts of the key which magically

317
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:13,579
matches up with what we had in our tag

318
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,769
there this means we don't know it's the

319
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:18,258
key yet giving you guys a peek here but

320
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,899
that is the key so we have an option of

321
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,860
decryption we have the PHP file if it's

322
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:25,879
being encrypted

323
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:28,189
it has to be able to decrypt it real

324
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:31,339
high-level here there's the encryption

325
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:35,660
function so it is base64 decoding that

326
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:37,790
blob of information gzip uncompressing

327
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,309
it and eval there is where the magics

328
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,959
happening it says whatever just got sent

329
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:46,170
in there executors run it

330
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,510
from a secure programming point of view

331
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,969
you shouldn't have the appalling your

332
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:54,540
PHP code you can have web shells in

333
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:57,660
JavaScript ASP asp.net Ruby it's not

334
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,160
just PHP the other thing that just

335
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,709
quickly to point out is the fact that

336
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,390
the this gets the response and then is

337
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:08,609
using the same crypto function to send

338
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:11,069
the data back so at this point we in

339
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,870
theory have the ability to get the

340
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,860
commands that were being sent in I

341
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,740
haven't showed you where those are

342
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,050
coming from decrypt them find out what

343
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,550
the response is and decrypt that so if

344
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,990
we had full packet capture at this point

345
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,069
we're able to determine what actions

346
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,600
were taken on that server all right now

347
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,970
where we're getting the commands this

348
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,740
was pretty nifty in my opinion remember

349
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,450
those accept language headers so there's

350
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:37,500
this values up here that actually have

351
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:39,360
to do with a see their confidence or a

352
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,720
percentage of I would prefer it to this

353
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,790
degree if I remember the spec correctly

354
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,120
those are matching up to this big old

355
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:51,079
long referred string saying grab those

356
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,080
arguments

357
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,560
and then it's going to put those all

358
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,270
together and then we magically have our

359
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,800
encrypted string so here's a case where

360
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:04,980
here we have something that was anomaly

361
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:11,560
and we're able to turn that into actual

362
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:13,779
data that we can operate on now this is

363
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,000
the crypto function you said feel free

364
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,220
to have your eyes gloss over and I've

365
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,050
been I used air quotes once this is

366
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,420
basic xor encryption so what it's doing

367
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,240
is it takes a bite of the key X stores

368
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,360
it with a bite of the data and you don't

369
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm not gonna get into X or it's very

370
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,400
basic but it works without this case of

371
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,230
decently and that's this crypto function

372
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,770
right here all right now there is

373
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,690
something that you might be thinking

374
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,860
about there's only so much data you can

375
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,089
shove into a referrer string and you

376
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,160
might have commands that are going to be

377
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,660
fairly long and the way that they got

378
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,060
around this that the author of weebly

379
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:56,170
got around this is these except language

380
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:59,410
headers yet again so they actually you

381
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,860
often used the first part of this here

382
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:07,150
the X and the s2 form kind of a session

383
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:11,080
token and using some of this code here

384
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,699
then basically he's taking those two

385
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,350
form okay this is the start of the data

386
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,089
and this is the end of the day even if

387
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,160
the command only takes one request he's

388
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,290
still gonna let wrap it in that that

389
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,000
allows the person to delimit where it is

390
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:26,620
this is useful for us by identifying

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,910
this code that was in that dropper after

392
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,250
we die off ascator because it allows us

393
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,569
to delimit where one command ends and

394
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:35,740
other command starts it allows us to

395
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,760
figure out the attackers actions by

396
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,020
putting things together through a quick

397
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,490
so part one first request these are

398
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,779
going to be three parts three different

399
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,950
requests coming in forming a single

400
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:49,810
command that's going to be executed

401
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:55,959
session key it's going to take the first

402
00:16:49,810 --> 00:17:00,969
part here first query string there we go

403
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:03,189
same session it's still www take the

404
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,480
first second

405
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,279
those together

406
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,349
wanting to point out the fact that on

407
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,388
this first request we didn't have a PHP

408
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,049
session but it is still taking advantage

409
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:18,168
of using these PHP sessions later on

410
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:23,269
third part putting it in there pulling

411
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:26,240
those pieces out cram it together so we

412
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:29,330
have the encrypted here decrypted down

413
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,049
here now back on that my fail of github

414
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,000
out there

415
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,010
I put the Python scripts that I use to

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,669
decode this out there not because it's

417
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,710
anything magical because it's not but

418
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:41,539
for those of you that this is something

419
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,159
that you're interested in you can look

420
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,139
at it and get a little bit understanding

421
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,600
of how it is match it up with the PHP

422
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:48,709
and try to figure out if this is

423
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,709
something that you want to implement

424
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,500
more in your own environments so in this

425
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:58,190
case the first command is that W get two

426
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:59,600
exploits com grabbing a file continue in

427
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,519
the scenario that I had outlined in the

428
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,490
pcap for those that want to continue

429
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,769
this on second command coming through is

430
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,929
a call to GCC probably shouldn't have

431
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:14,870
had GCC on the web server but hey we'll

432
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:19,700
let that slide and then my favorite

433
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:23,649
command here so what this what that

434
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,010
exploit was was it was a privilege X X

435
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:29,658
thank you escalation it gave you a shelf

436
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,279
so what this is doing is it's using that

437
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:36,350
command to create itself a new user and

438
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:39,110
duct tape in it into the pseudo users

439
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,990
and set itself with a password so

440
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:47,408
through this web shell through three

441
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:50,899
commands seven packets seven requests

442
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:54,200
set up a user account backdoor SSH

443
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:55,629
access into the server noisy when it

444
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,250
first happened but once it's there

445
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,539
they're done and then now they have SSH

446
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,130
access and they can try to blend in a

447
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,600
little bit better they might leave the

448
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,940
web shell there so they can come back

449
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,279
later might delete it so that it doesn't

450
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,630
get picked up by post integrity or if

451
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,549
you notice it and you try to come back

452
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:13,179
to grab the file to D office gate it

453
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,179
it's not there

454
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,799
back to the con

455
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,340
next some of those things like the refer

456
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:26,850
the accept language those browsers

457
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:29,600
require that context tools give you a

458
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:32,909
lot but people knowing your environment

459
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,879
give you even more there's that tribe

460
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,320
knowledge of understandings what you

461
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,190
should be seeing what you shouldn't be

462
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,899
seen for your network that ecosystem

463
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,280
those things it can't necessarily

464
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,540
transfer between them very well you can

465
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,950
understand we've Lee you can take that

466
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,418
to another job but there's definitely a

467
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,640
lot of advantage and the people that you

468
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,290
have and them understanding to a great

469
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,220
degree your environment better than the

470
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:01,080
attackers which is not always easy

471
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:07,290
alright so on this end of the week

472
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:09,030
promise again my reason for providing

473
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,379
this is hopefully this creates a little

474
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,030
bit of interest in people to want to dig

475
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,000
into it a little more none of us is

476
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,500
special this is just a little taste for

477
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,210
people to want to dive in more the pcap

478
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,830
of the attack traffic the tea shark

479
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,440
commands that I kind of use and find

480
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,760
useful parson turns out the Waverley

481
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,320
attacker command history what was the

482
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,910
commander actually doing that way you

483
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,250
can go back back and forth and try to

484
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,169
figure out if you could mimic this PHP

485
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,530
web shell the original one plus the D

486
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:37,980
office gated one can you go back through

487
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:41,010
and do the same process Python scripts

488
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,740
free decrypting and some of them I just

489
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,020
general notes for repeating the process

490
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:50,309
again the takeaway that I hope people

491
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,590
get is figure out which of these tools

492
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:56,190
might be of interest to you in the world

493
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,379
of attacker tools can you understand

494
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,580
them can you understand the context

495
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:04,500
where they're gonna stand out in your

496
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:07,309
environment and what can you do to match

497
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,960
those find those in your environment so

498
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,660
with that I think we have time from a

499
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:17,870
few questions Rob yep all right

500
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:27,330
questions yes

501
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:28,889
there's both of you that was the mistake

502
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,480
I made I went to commit it last night

503
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,010
and realized that it was on my lab

504
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:51,710
computer which I didn't bring with me so

505
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:51,710
it'll be up there when I fly back home I

506
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,830
think it needs to be so the question is

507
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,420
working with the owners of the systems

508
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,309
and the logs and stuff versus being the

509
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:07,790
primary person of knowledge is that

510
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:07,790
correct which is more effective

511
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,130
it depends as far as the security answer

512
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,750
if your analysts are looking for things

513
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,850
so the ones hunting for things are the

514
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,990
ones that are trying to do the responses

515
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,178
they need to have a little bit of that

516
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,130
knowledge themselves they can't just

517
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,660
reply on always going out to the other

518
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,070
owners to figure out hey this looked

519
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,710
kind of weird to me does this weird to

520
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,120
you so I think a lot of that knowledge

521
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:37,620
does need to be in people that are

522
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:40,830
hunting know what else there's a sign up

523
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,860
that say you could say all right thank

524
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,860
you
