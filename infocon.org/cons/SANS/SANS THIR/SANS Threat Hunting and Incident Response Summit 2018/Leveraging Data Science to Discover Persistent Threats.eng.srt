1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,635
(serene music)

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,445
(applause)

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,751
- [David] Hey guys,
I've given this

4
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,886
talk a couple of
times now at different

5
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,822
intelligence communities
and stuff like that.

6
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,724
I went to a DHS ATTE conference

7
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:28,495
which stands for Advanced
Threat Technical Exchange.

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,929
It wasn't very technical,

9
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,732
so I took out a lot of
the technical portions

10
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,000
just to come to a conference

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,268
where everything
is very technical.

12
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,871
So sorry about that.

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,041
We have a lot of cool images
and fun things for managers,

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,342
which is normally who I brief,

15
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:45,512
but the majority of
this presentation

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:46,880
is better as a conversation.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,181
So we're gonna
breeze through this,

18
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,016
and most of what's gonna
happen at the end of it,

19
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,251
if you guys have questions,
let's push questions.

20
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:53,787
I kind of have a
feeling you're going to,

21
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,222
because of the nature
of what we're doing.

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,791
Basically, what we work on

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,858
is what's called
the ECS Program.

24
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,563
The ECS is a sister
program of EINSTEIN.

25
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,066
Who's all heard of
EINSTEIN that DHS has?

26
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,434
A lot of people.

27
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,336
So I mean, it is
actually an exact replica

28
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,738
of the EINSTEIN program.

29
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,741
It's for US-based commercial
infrastructure, though.

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,477
And so I work on an ISP.

31
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,579
I work for an ISP
on this program

32
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,547
where we cover
down and we monitor

33
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,418
for foreign intelligence,
terrorist organizations,

34
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,554
and highly funded crime
syndicate activity

35
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,156
in US-based critical
infrastructure.

36
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,524
The way that the program works,

37
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,259
interested parties like ISPs--

38
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,462
I'm sorry, CenturyLink,
Verizon, AT&T,

39
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,832
other people are part
of the program as well.

40
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,032
They get cleared.

41
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,302
Intel comes from federal
intel communities.

42
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,971
DHS collects form
intel communities.

43
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,473
And cleared parties
identify vehicles

44
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:50,110
to leverage intel in
commercial spaces.

45
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,747
So basically what that means
is we set up a spot for them

46
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,015
to go to route their
traffic through us.

47
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,585
We monitor for
classified intelligence

48
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,220
in commercial organizations.

49
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,690
Obviously you have to take
people from previous spaces

50
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,861
like agencies whatnot who
have access to that intel.

51
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,662
They can read it,
they can identify it.

52
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,098
Whenever there's enriched
data that's necessary,

53
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,567
you submit downgrade
requests, whatnot.

54
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:19,239
So that's kind of
just a background of
the program itself.

55
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,207
I'll give kind of a
little bit of an overview

56
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,742
really quickly,
again, what it is,

57
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,710
but we're gonna go
into what we're doing

58
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,781
with the basics of intel,
how we're manipulating data

59
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:33,520
using unclassified attributes
of classified intel

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,421
to identified
classified intelligence

61
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,090
before it becomes classified.

62
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,859
And then I can push it out
to the commercial community.

63
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,529
I forgot I was in
charge of this.

64
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,100
So basically what I
just went through,

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,335
intel communities push
to Homeland Security,

66
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,173
which then goes down to CSPs,
which then we cover down

67
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,408
for critical infrastructure
in the United States.

68
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,677
One of the largest conversations
that's happening right now

69
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,380
is how we can play a role
in the election platforms.

70
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,582
Of course, that's a
buzz in everything as

71
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,817
you may or may not know but
ECS is on its schedule 70,

72
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,520
to be able to cover down
for that, so that one of

73
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,955
the things that
were driving right

74
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,557
now moving forward in that case.

75
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,662
The way that we do that
fundamentally is by setting up

76
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:18,898
IP sub tunnels to organizations
having them route their DNS

77
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,402
traffic back and forth to us.

78
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,674
So we cover them on DNS,
SMTP, and NetFlow indicators.

79
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,876
Right now were just
going to talk about DNS.

80
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,414
So in organizations,
not every organization

81
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,549
has people with clearances.

82
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,818
So whenever they
see something bad

83
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,786
and we're going to
hit them up and say,

84
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,120
Hey we saw this its bad.

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,388
Their like, Why is it bad?

86
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,224
Well I can't really
share that with you,

87
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,158
you're just going
to have to trust me.

88
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,659
Yah I'm not going to trust you.

89
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,361
I don't trust people I'm
paying for indicators with

90
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,929
and I come back through and
they actually give me intel

91
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,398
I still don't trust the intel.

92
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,000
So I'm not going to trust you
by not giving me anything.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,702
So how can we shift that around,

94
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,637
and open above
further conversation?

95
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,075
So, basically
non-mature organizations

96
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,875
Are going to come
through and say,

97
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,279
Well we actually can't
identify were the threat's at

98
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,047
we're just dealing
with DNS traffic,

99
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,816
how can I identify
where its coming from?

100
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:14,821
Well being able to, basically
implement honey pots.

101
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:20,659
Leveraging of WebRTC on
those apache frameworks,

102
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,263
allows us for us to
identify source IP addresses

103
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:28,268
of infected threats, and
utilization of Netflow

104
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,005
traffic across wire are
all different ways that can

105
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:36,709
leverage and be used to
identify an infected host.

106
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,879
So again, what we're kind
of going back through here,

107
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,582
if your somebody that
offers IOCs, if your someone

108
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,884
that's collecting IOCs, if
your somebody that's doing

109
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,620
anything with IOC's
on the front end of it

110
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,390
collect your intel
put it in one spot.

111
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,025
Whenever you guys come
to a conversation,

112
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,460
exactly what was talking
about this morning.

113
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,695
When coming out of that
conversation be ready to share.

114
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,398
Be ready to bring stuff
to the table, be ready to

115
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,501
actually give it up
because DHS is pushing down

116
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,703
classified intelligence
to whatever they can

117
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,506
to help cover down on
monitoring of intelligence

118
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,975
in a critical infrastructure.

119
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,244
If you guys are aware of
things, hey we're also aware

120
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,912
of activity that's
going on here.

121
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,381
Its the same exact
infrastructure, but
these domain names

122
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,984
these IP addresses you
guys may not be aware of.

123
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,053
We'll collect it, we'll
integrate it, we'll use it

124
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,554
in our statistical analysis.

125
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,793
Again Mitre at the top of
the page of course a buzzword

126
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,195
for this conference
which is great.

127
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,197
It's a great platform
it's what we use for

128
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,033
the aggregation of our
intelligence and being able

129
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:38,738
to sort of group together
the attributes of our data.

130
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,174
A bunch of other different
pieces where you can get

131
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,976
information on APT's,
terrorists organization,

132
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,411
and crime syndicates.

133
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,613
Of course there's tons of
different things you can monitor

134
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,617
for, so many downloads something
from Metasploit and they

135
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,119
create something that's
got a hash on it.

136
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,455
I don't care, we're
not coming down on Bob.

137
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,423
We're not looking for Bob
or George down the street.

138
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,660
We're looking for
the organizations

139
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,128
that I just talked about.

140
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,296
So these are where you'll
be able to find them.

141
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,331
Okay so automating
the hard work,

142
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,899
again kind of going back to that

143
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,268
you guys can sort of see
we're covering down on

144
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:13,539
23 different actors and you
can sort of see the outliers

145
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,876
here which is pretty
synonymous with what's going on

146
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,344
and the commercial industry
whatever everybody else

147
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,048
has been reporting, hey
these are the organizations

148
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,251
with the highest
hitting activity.

149
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,753
Of course DHS is not
going to let us put,

150
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,391
hey this is APD-28, 29
but you guys do the math.

151
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,560
So this is essentially
what we're doing.

152
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,331
We're pulling information
in, we're doing active

153
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,001
blocking, inline blocking
of known bad indicators.

154
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,102
And then we're actually
taking the attributes

155
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,073
of our known bad
indicators and then

156
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,808
putting them into
different databases.

157
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,243
And when I say
attributes, I mean

158
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,947
TTLs of DNS names when
it was registered,

159
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,817
everything that Umbrella
talked about yesterday

160
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,585
we're essentially doing
the exact same thing

161
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,421
but we're doing it with
classified intelligence.

162
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,757
Again, anything that I'm
going to say up here is

163
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,393
not going to be new we've
already talked about all of it,

164
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,095
it's the source of the
data that's basically

165
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,632
different in our case.

166
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,601
Again, that conversation
if you guys wanted to be

167
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,171
involved in that say, hey
we'd love to be able to see

168
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,339
the intel that your producing
that your coming up with

169
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,742
after this your share with
the rest of the community.

170
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,811
We're happy to do
that reach out to me

171
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,078
contact me we're happy to
provide that information

172
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,581
back to you guys,
hey these are other

173
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,017
indicators we're finding and
then going back to the source

174
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,553
to identify what processes
are initiating these

175
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,588
to validate that it
is actually a threat.

176
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,591
So things we're
going to go over.

177
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,461
Really quickly DGA exposure
and pattern based algorithm.

178
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,996
Again we talked about
a lot of these also,

179
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,799
we're just going to go
over really quickly.

180
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,172
Models used for this are the
DGA basically training at once.

181
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,075
If you guys want to talk
about this a little bit more

182
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,610
I don't want to bore you with
this its almost lunch time.

183
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,780
But Exposure Model it
actually needs to be trained

184
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,381
multiple times you have
to use a lot of different

185
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,049
data you have to train it
you have to look at it again

186
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,919
train it again, training with
known goods and known bads.

187
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,025
So this essentially
what I just said,

188
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:17,296
allows for us to identify
unclassified domains

189
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,698
leveraging classified data.

190
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,268
So in DGA, have you guys
know the life cycle.

191
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,904
There's like five or
six different ways.

192
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:28,207
Five or six hundred
different ways that a DGA can

193
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,142
produce or domain or hash.

194
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:35,147
This right here is the model
used for using the same

195
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,785
NTP server, so you grab a
time stamp you have the same

196
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:42,121
NTP server the time
stamp becomes your hash,

197
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,891
you push your hash through
and that way your C2 and

198
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,461
your client know what the
domain is supposed to look like.

199
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,632
So as you can see we
basically just come up and

200
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,034
showing you guys randomly
generated, dictionary based

201
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,670
generated and hybrid
generated domains.

202
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,974
Exposure, Exposure again
uses the attributes of it.

203
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,344
What we can as it goes
across the packet size,

204
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,514
TTL associated, when
was it registered,

205
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,250
who was it registered by,
email addresses registered,

206
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,419
what geographical location
of an IP address was used

207
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,755
to register the domain,
every aspect of that.

208
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,456
It's pushed into there,
we push it back through.

209
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,692
We have a localized database.

210
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,162
And all of the monitoring
of it is all done passively.

211
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:26,032
Obviously we can't do
monitoring of inline traffic

212
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,233
as it goes across
because there's

213
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,801
just too much traffic
and its too quick.

214
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,472
WhiteListed,
obviously TrendMicro,
Symantec, and Verizon

215
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,675
they all use DGA in different
types of exposure stuff

216
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,878
like in their domain
names, you have a lot of

217
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,813
false positives you have to
WhiteList different types

218
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,515
of stuff and BlackList anything.

219
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,817
I think Bambeneck was
discussed yesterday.

220
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,355
AlienVaults and AIS, AIS
is another good source

221
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:54,360
that DHS pushes out some
of them are validated

222
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,896
some them are not validated
sort of take it with

223
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,598
a grain of salt,
but at least there's

224
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,498
something there for you
guys to be able to use.

225
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,336
Exposure Model
attributes, again TTL,

226
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:06,505
registration, IP variations,
responses, daily trends,

227
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:07,707
and cost per query.

228
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,610
So if you guys have any
questions on that I'm

229
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,111
happy to discuss it later.

230
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,681
The pattern based algorithm.
Pattern based algorithm is

231
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,450
really near and dear to my
heart because its one of those

232
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,553
things I helped develop
based on my time as an

233
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,622
offensive security operator and

234
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,223
offensive intelligence operator.

235
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,825
So I know lots of the call
back intervals are configured

236
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,729
specific ways with randomized
variables in there that say

237
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,598
hey instead of call back every
two hours use a randomized

238
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,666
variable that says call back
every one hour and forty five

239
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,203
minutes to every two
hours and fifteen minutes.

240
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,170
Which then makes it
nearly impossible to say

241
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,474
hey this is a two
hour time interval.

242
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,611
So we pull all the attributes
back together, identify a

243
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,582
scope bandwidth, because some
pieces of malware are actually

244
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,251
configured to get all of your
commands your supposed to run

245
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,853
at one time process all of
them and push them back so

246
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:59,158
you don't need to do another
query again for an IP address.

247
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,628
But some of them are designed
to call out get the IP

248
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,265
address of your domain
that's set to a TTL of one

249
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,567
run a command do it again.

250
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,636
So then you have groupings
of call outs that

251
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:14,339
go over the course and that
actually tends to break

252
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,010
your algorithm
whenever they're not.

253
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,512
It just doesn't
process properly.

254
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,513
So then you have to identify
when the pieces of malware

255
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,215
woke up and when it
went back to sleep.

256
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:26,585
And sometimes that
can be 15-20 minutes,

257
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,321
if its not actively being used.

258
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,091
So you basically have
to group together.

259
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,860
So we use SK-learn
and Python to do that

260
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,196
to be able to
cluster those for us.

261
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,266
So basic call back
interval will be set to

262
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:45,671
7200 seconds which is two hours.

263
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,773
That's sort of the base, it
could be set to two hours,

264
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,542
it could be set to 24 hours,
it could be set to anything.

265
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,644
It just depends on how much
data your able to collect and

266
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,281
put into your database to
process your algorithm through.

267
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,819
This is kind of the processes
that it goes through.

268
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,853
Again, it gets
extremely technical

269
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,122
it's right before lunch
I'm not gonna do that

270
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,257
it's also raining
out and I think it

271
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,626
kind of makes people tired.

272
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,297
If anyone has any
questions just let me know.

273
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,634
So again kind of when we
put the data back together.

274
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:20,206
We sort of started to be able
to see configured intervals.

275
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,142
Obviously you had to
take out your outliers

276
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,745
and you see your
variations and things

277
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,913
start to become a
little more clear.

278
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,385
So again as I said, we're not
the only people doing this.

279
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:37,323
I just took a black cat
course in Vegas from Cylance.

280
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,025
They're doing stuff
with DGA as well.

281
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,661
They're doing a really
great job at it if you guys

282
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,231
have any questions about
that Cylance people here but

283
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,900
look up Tom Paste on LinkedIn,
he'd be happy to have

284
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,535
a conversation
with you about it.

285
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,371
We're going to go back through,

286
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,274
this is sort of the alerting
platform methodology

287
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,778
you can use for
that, ELK and Splunk.

288
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
I mean Splunk is too expensive,
if you wanted to do this

289
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,516
in your low cost, use ELK
use GrayLog they're both

290
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,017
methodologies you can use
that are really inexpensive.

291
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,220
But you can kind of see
the way it comes in.

292
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,291
You pull a tap, an optical
tap, pass an optical tap

293
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,994
database it, in the database
of the attributes we pull

294
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,830
the information out with
the algorithm and then

295
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,567
process data, generate alerts,
alerts go back out to a human

296
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,537
and then that gets pushed
back out to the end user.

297
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,340
Again being able to put the
information in and basically

298
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,378
what we're doing is to being
able to tag information in ELK.

299
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,846
If you guys aren't familiar
with that looking up

300
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,415
tagging information in
ELK, its a really easy way

301
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,416
to be able to add filters
to it and look at it

302
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,020
that's data that's
already in there.

303
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,788
Chances are you're
probably aware of it.

304
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,458
Again this is Cylance interface
they're doing a really

305
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,928
great job, this is their DGA
model that they are using.

306
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,464
Predictions analysis
and what not.

307
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,505
So essentially you're able to
see kind of different types of

308
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,908
statistical analysis when
outliers are processed through

309
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,412
and how they're viewed in maps.

310
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,913
Okey-Doke, Thanks guys.
