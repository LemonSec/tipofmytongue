1
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,259
My name is Ben Johnson I'll get to my back in a second I think Rob kind of covered it I am on Pacific time

2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,950
This is my first conference wearing glasses I have 47 slides and I got in at 1:00 a.m. So let's see how this goes

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,430
But I'm really excited to be here throughout. Hunting incident response summits the challenge is

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,830
What do I talk about we have a whole slew of great technical talks deep dives

5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,550
vendors

6
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,050
The keynotes meant to be a little bit more high-level, which is good because then

7
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,110
I can just say stuff that's neither right nor wrong and you can figure it out later

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,360
So let's just dive in mmm and thanks to san putting up with my late

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,110
Late slide submission and and all that they can you know kick me later

10
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,760
so

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
agenda real simple

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
state of cyber I'll give you a spoiler it's not great and

13
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,259
Then maybe we can look a little bit into entrepreneurship

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,720
Are, there some lessons we can take from entrepreneurship and apply that to our efforts to hunt and then, we'll wrap up

15
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,299
my general approach to

16
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,880
Presentations is to throw as much at you as I can and just hope a couple things stick

17
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,330
you can take all the pictures you want I will happily give you all these slides so you don't have to take any pictures if

18
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,330
you don't want to

19
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,890
So as Rob mentioned

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,649
got my start in the Intel community and I say went to man Tech worked with Rob Phil

21
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,240
Henry I think I see mark you know a bunch other people intrusion operations division it was unbelievable

22
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,280
Stuff, I would have done for free

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,210
I think we all would have done for free and we got paid for it so so there we go

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,349
Ultimately ended up leaving government world did a couple years in finance actually went back

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,508
Helped found carbon black helped write the first version and then ended up

26
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,659
Jumping on planes for several years to talk to people like yourselves so up to 600 organization and my goal

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,459
excuse me was quite simply to absorb learn and then hopefully I can

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,229
Contribute something back to the discussion and then I get the start again so I moved to Southern California

29
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,480
Started obsidian we're about 35 people last year, we were about 5 so it's been kind of a wild year and being in Southern California

30
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,319
you'll spots of slides with beaches and stuff just so I can rub it in a little bit

31
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,599
but if anyone wants to come visit please come visit

32
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:47,209
Speaking about entrepreneurship I really love the startup journey so I'm on all other boards different stages different types of companies and I taught

33
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,639
Entrepreneurship at University of Chicago to the Masters in computer science program, so that's where some of this stuff comes from

34
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,589
So today's goal and I always throw this slide in there you'll see if you've seen me present before you'll see a few slides that

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
maybe you've seen multiple times

36
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:09,619
Reuse right why not but my goal for a presentation is always just to get you to think I just want you to contemplate

37
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:16,069
Hopefully the alerts are shut off the phones on airplane mode don't have meetings you just hear all in one room

38
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,789
absorb think contemplate and hopefully you walk away with something

39
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:23,910
Another reason my

40
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,769
Being up here is a little crazy is

41
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:33,739
I'm in the middle of a physical world Incident Response where I have to in my Chicago house that refused to leave and

42
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,179
I've been talking to all of these yes including SWAT team

43
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,418
over the last week I was in Chicago till last night

44
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:44,059
Mmm, they're all their stuff still there they finally left

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,280
What their stuff is still there and they have a lot of stuff

46
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,229
So yeah kinda like a cyber incident response right there's all these different

47
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:58,459
Groups not necessarily having the same information different incentives so I move fast so I move incredibly slow

48
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,939
But anybody snuff about that just just thought that was interesting

49
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,569
The state of cyber

50
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,869
You probably all sick of the headlines

51
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,959
Breach fatigue headline fatigue we in this room care that's why you're here

52
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,019
But to be honest I don't even up this slide

53
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:23,598
Because you don't really care what the headlines are the point is it's not pretty and

54
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,460
What's maybe a little bit sobering is getting better

55
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,370
Now we're becoming more and more connected more digital so just in pure

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,619
quantity there's going to be more, breaches but it's just exploded and

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,580
Even the cloud which I truly believe is an opportunity for us to be way more secure is

58
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,670
Leaky is causing more problems

59
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,810
This is also probably outdated by now but there's just a lot of leaks whether it's compromised, whether it's an open s3 bucket

60
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,590
it's too easy to to leak data and

61
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:08,119
A variety of adversaries and what would a talk be without a threat scape slide so you get minerals hacktivists

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,410
Nation-states

63
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,820
insiders you get financial crimes usually maybe making a statement

64
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:22,069
Espionage maybe election interference other aspects of nation states and insiders but the only reason I put this slide up here

65
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,030
Is the insiders

66
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,289
people forget about

67
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,249
Insiders and I'm not talking the person sitting next to you

68
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,480
They might be an insider sure but I'm talking about their access

69
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,180
because what are the first three after the

70
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,090
First thing they're after is access

71
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,979
then they

72
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,939
Try to focus on their objectives they need that maintained persistent access and a lot of times, that's through

73
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,779
employee access credential access blending in

74
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,239
So, I want us to keep that in mind and there's a challenges

75
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,920
so

76
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,900
to me there's no debate that there's a skills gap the reasons for the skills gap maybe people have different opinions HR has bad

77
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,300
Descriptions or the pool is too small, whatever it is there's not enough qualified butts and seats

78
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,250
Then you set up your tech stack your security stack and you

79
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,258
Have deploy and decay it gets worse over time you don't have enough people giving it the care and feeding

80
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,059
Sort of brushing its teeth all the time so environments change adversaries change

81
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,659
maybe your detection rules prevention rules your configs stay the same

82
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,210
You're going to get decay

83
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,679
then attackers bad guys, whomever they're having success

84
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,190
So they get encouraged to do more or their friends like any market it drives competition

85
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,150
they dive in and

86
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,440
Then finally huge data I don't even know if that's a real term but

87
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,719
It's so easy you click a button you copy terabytes of information to the cloud everything syncing all over the place

88
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,750
every copy of data is a liability

89
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
And we're copying it all over the place so

90
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,020
essentially

91
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,180
the summation of that is this lack of cyber self-esteem

92
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
now people in this room actually probably have the most

93
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,329
Cyber self-esteem you actually think you, can make a difference and I love that I think we can too but

94
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,330
When you travel the world you talk to lots of organizations whether it's at sea so?

95
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,090
having little faith in their team whether it's the team having little faith in the executives or the culture or whatever

96
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,279
It's tough, we need mr. Rogers to come out and give us an after-school special

97
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,739
So hunting rob

98
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,370
Was just talking about what's the definition of hunting to me it's pretty simple and I'm not saying this is the end-all be-all definition

99
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,829
You can detect all of the things

100
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
tools don't

101
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:56,299
So there's a gap there's a gap where we need human minds critical thought human time manual efforts

102
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,029
to me that's hunting finding the stuff that lives in that gap and

103
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,829
Ideally we all have the equivalent of the predator drone

104
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
fly it to the target

105
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
take these nests

106
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,269
But reality is never ideal

107
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,060
We might not even have a weapon we might not even have time to hunt and in fact that's a lot of this talk is

108
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,729
Just trying to do maybe a little bit even if you don't have much

109
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,808
So ken hunting be formulaic can we come up with a formula do we just you know add X headcount throw some tools in there

110
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,330
Get some buy-in and you're done

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
No, there's no formula

112
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,009
Sure maybe you can find the Rambo or the Wonder Woman or that sort of badass technical hunter

113
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,620
Cool those are not scalable to find they're probably mostly in this room

114
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
there's not many of them in the world

115
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,230
So entrepreneurship sort of set in the stage entrepreneurship who here thinks they're an entrepreneur

116
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:11,240
Come on I get I get a couple hands few come on all right we'll come back to that

117
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
So what's the formula for startups

118
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,180
Do you just have an idea throw some work at but maybe raise some money and you're done your profit

119
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,610
It's incredibly hard incredibly hard there's no formula

120
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,720
But maybe we can start thinking about how startups have a little bit more guidance

121
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:43,939
So Toyota in the 70s or 80s invented something called lean manufacturing and some people, even think it was in the 30s

122
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:53,420
Quite simply they said we're gonna reduce waste eliminate waste and what is waste waste is anything that doesn't directly contribute to

123
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,819
value for the customer and

124
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,090
there's lots of ways you might have waste

125
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,310
You might ship things and an inefficient route you might have workers on a factory floor taking too

126
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,919
Many, steps you might do too many quality control X it doesn't really matter for this purpose but

127
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,098
What matters is there's a lot of waste and we all have waste

128
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,848
we all do things that don't Altima add value at the end

129
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,650
and

130
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,120
so

131
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,410
thinking about that thinking about reducing waste and focus I just want to throw out there one of my favorite books and

132
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,579
Actually have a book section at the end because if you take nothing else away other than a book recommendation

133
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,888
I think it's still a successful day

134
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,049
Essentialism is about finding your greatest point of contribution

135
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,640
Basically what's the biggest ROI of your time and?

136
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,009
I've done lots of presentations on this kind of topic because we all have the same amount of time

137
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,248
86,000 and change seconds per day

138
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,410
How do we spend it?

139
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,379
How do you get the biggest ROI and we talk about throw our instant response how are you getting the biggest bang for your buck

140
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,220
and

141
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,220
these kinds of ideas

142
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:10,669
Led, to something called the Lean Startup methodology and a lot of you have probably heard some of this before maybe you know it way

143
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:17,839
better than me that's okay, but Lean Startup is about how can you get your product and service into the hands of

144
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,380
Customers faster and how do you reduce uncertainty know that you're building the right thing

145
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,490
Only like four people raised their hands when I asked where entrepreneurs were

146
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,699
Entrepreneurs everywhere it's a mindset

147
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,330
even if you work for a big company you can be an entrepreneur and

148
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,030
sometimes they close intrapreneurs

149
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,650
But it's just about identify

150
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,858
And trying to solve it trying to build something to solve it doesn't mean you have to go raise money or something like that

151
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,299
but a lot of it is you got to think big you got to think about solving something worthwhile

152
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,210
but then you start small you take that first step and

153
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:05,330
Then ideally move fast scale fast and I love quotes you'll see quotes throughout mouth we'll talk

154
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,020
The day before something's a breakthrough it's a crazy idea

155
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,459
and

156
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,509
So hopefully in your heads and we'll start to tie this a little bit more directly to hunting but hopefully in your heads you can

157
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,910
See, where some of this is going in terms of things like hunting incident response security in general

158
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,000
Another topic in another principle in

159
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Lean Startup methodology is

160
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,200
validated learning

161
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,219
Basically how fast can you learn there's another question you might ask which is when you raised five million bucks 10 million

162
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,500
Bucks, what did you learn from spending that money

163
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,039
It's not just about product output, or whatever it's about learning as a company as a team as a business, whatever and same here

164
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
how quickly can you learn

165
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:59,269
create hypothesis we're an experiment analyze the results repeat to me that sounds a lot like hunting and

166
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,559
All I do is basically work family and then read books

167
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
Or watch TED Talks and stuff

168
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,670
Reading a book right now called rocket men amazing book haven't finished it yet

169
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,490
But they had this quote they said are you learning in gulps or sips it's a very simple way to remember it

170
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,240
Are you learning in gulps or?

171
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,839
Sips in your work are you learning in gulps or sips during instant response and you're learning in gulps or sips

172
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,360
So a big part of Lean Startup methodology is how fast can you learn is this the right thing

173
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,069
the right feature the right product the right color the right price and

174
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,529
So what Lean Startup methodology did was then create a cycle because everyone likes cycles and

175
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,998
it's really simple to remember build measure learn

176
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:56,100
Build something go deploy it run it it whatever but you have to be able to measure it

177
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,259
Then learn from it if you can't measure it you can't optimize it

178
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,649
So you go through this cycle and this is very common in startup and this is really what agile software development and agile

179
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,850
Methodology tries to follow, which is very iterative can I do something every sprint or every every day even that improves things and

180
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,029
if we're talking about loops doodle loops

181
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,930
You probably have uh de loop fatigue if you come to a lot of these

182
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,009
But the whole point is in the US Air Force they came out with

183
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,380
Something called odo loop, which is in military dogfighting whoever can observe?

184
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,519
Orient, decide and act the fastest as a pilot

185
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,319
Welwyn

186
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,790
Can you observe your environment orient yourself to the environment

187
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,790
Decide and then act

188
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,050
Go through that loop and I have to say decide is tough sometimes you've got to be comfortable making decisions just as like a tip

189
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,590
right

190
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:01,499
The thing I still have to do all the time is make decisions and sometimes very quickly without information

191
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,450
MVP Minimum Viable Product

192
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,920
part of

193
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
entrepreneurship part of Lean Startup

194
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,850
This is what they're trying to get across what we're trying to talk about

195
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,560
Which is what's the smallest thing you can build it adds value?

196
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,300
get that out there get that in the hands of people and

197
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
See if it's working see if it's valuable

198
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:30,698
So start to think about what MVP you thinks may be necessary so

199
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:38,709
Maybe slightly slightly more interesting I hope I'm keeping everyone awake. I know it's early

200
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,199
So

201
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,618
talking about applied lean hunting

202
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,309
and I call it just hunting

203
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:55,180
Because I think we should be hunting more than threats we hunt a risk and a risk is an overloaded term but

204
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,560
Aspects of your environment to contribute to a higher likelihood of compromise

205
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,810
So sitting here can you all think about what can I build

206
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:11,049
To start helping hunting in my environment maybe you have a great hunting program. I'm sure it can be better

207
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,469
Maybe you have zero what can you do to start

208
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,439
So what is your pain point

209
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,000
when you sit down and you say you know what I want to hunt what is your pain point and

210
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,818
Start to think about what would you build is a product

211
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,079
service

212
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:30,218
piece of information whatever it is who is this for

213
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,399
what is this for it's

214
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,829
a pretty common

215
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,708
Example, which is are you building a painkiller or a vitamin I

216
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,009
Like vitamins but they're not that necessary when you need a painkiller you need a painkiller and you will pay for it

217
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:48,500
And

218
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,689
Einstein said this or at least people think he did that's up for debate like most things

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,149
If I had to spend an hour solving a problem that's been the first 55 minutes thinking about the problem

220
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:05,858
Do you understand your pain points when it comes to hunting what's truly preventing you from doing more hunting or doing better hunting

221
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,890
can you think about that

222
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,980
So

223
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,089
When you think about hunting or at least when I think about hunting

224
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,749
you're kind of choosing left or right and

225
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,739
Then you need to figure out did you make the right choice or not

226
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:30,059
But if you made the wrong choice you need to figure that out very quickly we all pull those threads

227
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,990
during analysis during investigation and go down a rat hole and lose days weeks whatever

228
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,928
And find nothing or learn very little

229
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,929
so can you very quickly fail and realize hey, I went down the wrong path

230
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,520
let me

231
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,520
course-correct pivot go the other direction

232
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,109
And you kind of do that over and over again until you get to what you're looking for

233
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:01,229
So how quickly can you do that and can you learn from that can you start to realize why did you make that decision

234
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,949
was it just sort of gut flip a coin whatever

235
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,010
Why'd you run this query why'd you decide to look over here can you start to understand maybe a little bit more data or science

236
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,129
Behind that so that next time you get better and better and better and better

237
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,190
And

238
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,190
You might have seen this slide before

239
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:26,129
but a lot of it starts with visibility a lot of hunting is you have tons of logs tons of data

240
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,570
If you have a data like a sim bunch of tools whatever and you're querying you're searching you're looking at stuff cool

241
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,220
But if you don't have the information what are you doing how are you hunting not, saying it's impossible

242
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,100
But it's gonna be a lot more

243
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,410
retrieving and waiting for things to come back so if you can collect information the better and

244
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,939
Can you collect the best information can you collect things that are already enriched or can you enrich information before you start using it

245
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:02,129
What is this IP address who is this user what are the relationships between these people are these events that's super valuable information

246
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,929
You've got to try to start with that and

247
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,519
Then utilize open source and ap is

248
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,250
Hunting isn't necessarily

249
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:21,780
Programming software engineering but I have to say the best security teams out there that I see are basically all software engineers at this point

250
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:27,909
they try to automate the crap out of everything and then they write code for anything new and

251
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,799
a lot of teams do a great job of combining commercial and open source

252
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:40,929
some products maybe it makes way more sense to do the commercial version but there are some pretty cool open-source tools out there and

253
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,650
Guess what maybe you can prove out your point with an open source tool that doesn't require a procurement

254
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:51,879
Because I know that's a pain point that's a block to hunting sometimes and

255
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
just to call out a specific example

256
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,819
One of the coolest things i've i've seen

257
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:05,020
It's just a sort of slightly thinking outside the box is like honey cards or honey credit cards kind of thing where teams

258
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,080
just spend like a thousand bucks on some

259
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,928
prepaid credit cards sprinkle those credit card numbers throughout your environment and documents and

260
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,809
then if you ever get a charge in any of those cards

261
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,839
it's a very high signal-to-noise ratio

262
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,629
You might never get a hit so you can't just count on that but very high signal-to-noise ratio

263
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,249
Those are the kinds of things you can start to deploy without a lot of effort without a lot of cost

264
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,789
And

265
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:40,869
In thinking about this you know my original thought for the talk was because I wanted to get you riled up

266
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,739
Our threat hunting an instant response the same thing

267
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,399
And I still asked myself that and I still think maybe they are

268
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
We hunted, bin Laden but that

269
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,209
was really Incident Response if if we're InfoSec they're sort of hunting my tenants in Chicago but

270
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,330
sort of Incident Response there too

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
so

272
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,740
You know I don't know but the point here

273
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,049
Is when you start thinking about your pain points maybe how you can contribute to improving hunting

274
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:19,270
Improving some aspects of maybe Incident Response triage there are different stages you know hunting may be a little bit more exploratory

275
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,938
Discoverable events and then usually you still have to do some triage before it's a full-blown investigation or maybe what people call true incident response

276
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,530
Where are you helping? Where can you provide value can you take capabilities from different parts of the spectrum and

277
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,750
help and use tools for different things

278
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,090
Can you use a hunting tool for?

279
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:43,698
investigation probably can use an investigation tool for hunting probably

280
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:50,028
So just be thinking about that how do I use stuff. I already have people already have

281
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:53,789
And

282
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:56,959
then entrepreneurial journey you have to sell

283
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:00,769
How many people in the room are salespeople?

284
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,148
How many people who didn't raise their hand consider themselves like they sell stuff

285
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:11,759
Well I'll give you a

286
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,439
Spoiler here when I was teaching my entrepreneurship class and the class

287
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,480
was pretty cool is 10 weeks you come in with nothing you make teams and at 10 weeks it's like Shark Tank you pitch to

288
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,349
A whole panel and you know here's my idea. Here's my MVP there's you know customer feedback etc. Is awesome I really enjoyed that

289
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,458
But I asked one of the teams what are you selling they said oh we're not selling anything

290
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,379
I'm like no you're always selling. I'm selling you guys right now on these topics on

291
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,339
me on my company on everything can you sell

292
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,579
your company on new spending

293
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,409
can you sell your

294
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:48,829
Organization on freeing up time to hunt

295
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,029
Can you sell the culture on?

296
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,110
helping you improve

297
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:02,839
efficacy or other aspects of hunting and it's in response for example if everyone would just listen to music on their phone instead of installing

298
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:06,888
Spotify and everything else on their laptop you'll have fewer events to look at

299
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,559
the culture can truly make a difference in how easy you can hunt or how effective you can be

300
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,439
So you have to learn how to sell

301
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,809
I'm a huge introvert

302
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:23,329
Technical geek guy and I have to do all sorts of stuff and go ask for millions of dollars and things like that

303
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,299
it just helps if you learn how to sell and

304
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,018
Then competition you know you don't want to completely focus on competition when you're building a product

305
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
but if you're a practitioner

306
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,479
Your competition is other

307
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,980
activities

308
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,019
Everything is grabbing at your time trying to steal your time

309
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:54,169
And some of its waste like we talked about so can you look at comput mission hunting competition and

310
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,250
Figure out ways to create more leverage involve other people

311
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,969
Automates that kind of thing so then you free up. Time the other thing I want you to do is

312
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,520
Beat up your vendors and I'm a multi vendor time person so I can say that

313
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,539
When you figure out something that should be done in your environment or something that would make your life easier

314
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,229
build it yourself but at the same time can currently ask your vendor join a customer advisory board

315
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,010
just provide some feedback go to user groups whatever it is

316
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,650
It doesn't hurt you to ask

317
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,389
Could they add this one field could they output it in JSON instead of syslog

318
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,790
whatever it is there's a whole bunch of stuff just ask

319
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,259
Ask as a vendor we crave

320
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,129
Feedback, we want to hear what makes your lives easier?

321
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:54,169
So, yes build stuff yourself the best teams out there are building things themselves but they

322
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,839
also push hard on their vendors

323
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,480
So wrapping up and ranting even more than I already am

324
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,319
So one of the TED Talks I was watching I can't member even which one but the absence of disease does not mean health

325
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,169
And I think that describes

326
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,930
InfoSec very well

327
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,880
the absence of a PT or the absence of compromise or pick your term

328
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,669
Does not mean you have a great environment. I think everyone would pretty pretty quickly

329
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,339
Agree with that so when I talked about hey

330
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,220
I consider hunting not just thread hunting but like other stuff

331
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,550
Other things you can go look for is a human to try to improve things

332
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,280
Can you figure out where your entropy is or where different aspects of risk are

333
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,609
Can you when you hunt a successful hunting outcome why not be finding

334
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,430
apt, or pick your terminology

335
00:25:53,190 --> 00:26:01,130
Sophisticated thread actors or even run-of-the-mill, malware it might be finding misconfigurations or lots of configuration drift

336
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,020
that kind of stuff

337
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,200
and

338
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,139
You know us thinking about this and I was like you know what I'm gonna you know we talked about upstream downstream

339
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,379
I'm gonna make a chart or a graph that says hey risk is a slope and the more risk you have the steeper the slope

340
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,670
and then your environment is sitting at the top and it's just kind of sliding down into

341
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
Compromise

342
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,440
So can you lower the slope decrease the slope

343
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,730
Reduce risk reduce the slope

344
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,780
and

345
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,780
So one thing that's really

346
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,408
really common is something called identity creep

347
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,570
privilege creep pick your latest buzzword of the year kind of thing but everyone has access in this room everyone has access they don't need

348
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:53,609
100% guaranteed I've bet a lot of money on that our percent we have 30 people

349
00:26:54,490 --> 00:27:00,180
We have people that haven't used AWS for 238 days now that's my CEO who is busy doing other stuff

350
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:05,220
But even we at 3030

351
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,990
have

352
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,990
accounts we don't need and

353
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,260
Then it is hard I dumped our AWS

354
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,570
schema they have a way to dump it your security settings and policy settings in JSON

355
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,450
30. People not doing anything crazy

356
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,959
20,000 lines of JSON so it's a hard problem figure out who has what permissions I am roles etc

357
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,830
The point is when you're hunting you might find some of this stuff can you go find accounts that don't need to exist

358
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,420
It's not just about malware we're gonna get a lot of great talks on worse engineering and network packets and stuff, that's awesome cool

359
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,879
We need to know that stuff but it's not just about that

360
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Can you right size your surface area?

361
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,040
can you find either it could be

362
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,560
Accountants be accounts it could be systems we've all heard of the server that everyone thought was unplugged and that

363
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,708
Was the one that got compromised no one even knew it was still in the network

364
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,208
Can you shrink your surface area reduce your risk

365
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,649
and guess what

366
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,369
it gives you a more focused area to hunt in

367
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:16,170
It's like if you shrink the size of a football field and you're playing defense you're probably going to have a better time

368
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,330
Because you don't have to run all over

369
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
Defending the wide receivers and stuff

370
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
and

371
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,479
Look we're talking about lean we're trying to do more with less and and just you know reduce waste

372
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:31,270
talk to a 600 person company

373
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,530
Just in three services they're wasting 35 K a month

374
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,139
They can't hire headcount the the C

375
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,170
So has actually just left because he couldn't get any headcount that's like 400 grand that's plenty of headcount there

376
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,230
Or at least that's a start will say

377
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:55,030
So in your hunting there might be different outcomes the point of all this is it's not just about things like malware or compromised

378
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,989
find things that contribute to waste

379
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,810
find waste and

380
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,999
To rant a little bit more I think Phil and and Rob mentioned there are 60

381
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,589
60 talk submissions I was on the I'm on the advisory board for this so

382
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,430
Thank you for all the submissions I really enjoyed reading them and voting on which ones I thought

383
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,448
could get picked and and if you didn't get picked to come come yell at me or whatever

384
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,910
It wasn't just me it was a group of like ten of us or whatever?

385
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,640
probably blamed Phil or Rob the most though

386
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,120
but

387
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,610
60 submissions I

388
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,429
Think three or four were on cloud I

389
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,989
Was blown away we got to think more about cloud cloud is here

390
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,570
cloud is here

391
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:45,310
IT is going from zero to 100 and leaving cloud security in the dust when it comes to cloud

392
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,530
We're blind to all these SAS accounts

393
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
50% of IR

394
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:54,009
For rapid seven or at least this team at rapid seven is

395
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,240
office 365

396
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,980
50% that's a lot

397
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:04,120
And we have 300 AWS accounts and no governance sure no one has that problem in this room

398
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:10,389
And I just like this quote hackers don't break and they log in but the point is I hope next year

399
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,090
We talk a little bit more about cloud

400
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:22,090
AWS forensics hunting and slack I don't know pick your pick your topic but it's here it's here

401
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,160
even the big

402
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,269
Conservative financial institutions they've been around a hundred years are

403
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,609
Moving I've talked to the intelligence community they're like we want to use slack but

404
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,669
We don't know how to use it because we can't really monitor it

405
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,660
It's here we need more talks on cloud

406
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,190
So wrapping up here, where's the waste where's the extra risk where's the entropy

407
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,900
when you hunt

408
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Can you find that kind of stuff

409
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:57,729
where can you spend your time when you actually do get time to hunt

410
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,300
Can you find time to do that?

411
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,049
Identify what's providing value and?

412
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,610
focus on that and try to reduce

413
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:12,399
The other time you spend we all have to experiment and try things but as soon as you realize this isn't actually

414
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,810
increasing our capabilities to haunt do instant response overall cyber defense whatever it is

415
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,839
get rid of it or Park it for a bit

416
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,830
Build measure learn

417
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:32,499
I think everyone will remember that but go build something even if it's just tying a couple api's together

418
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,280
See if that helps you write a little bit of python

419
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,119
Python, never killed anybody as far as I know maybe I'm wrong

420
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
think big start small act fast

421
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,320
Be the hunter that your environment needs

422
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:55,630
There's a quote from Guy Kawasaki a legend in Silicon Valley a chief evangelist at Apple be an entrepreneur being an entrepreneur is a state

423
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,810
of mind not a job title and I'm pretty certain

424
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,178
I'm not the first person to say this but I don't know who who

425
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,889
Did so I just put my name there being a hunter is a state of mind. It's not a job title

426
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,700
So I told you I like a lot of books I could give you tons and tons of recommendations I

427
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,939
love these books I read them multiple times

428
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:26,440
Rocket men is one I'm reading right now about Apollo 8, which is really exciting space race between Russia and the u.s

429
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,009
Essentialism team of teams about how

430
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,639
JSOC had to reform themselves to fight al-qaeda in Iraq it

431
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,140
Was just really interesting on extreme ownership all about some some lessons learned from

432
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,160
really high combat areas really cool stuff

433
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,330
So the goal sparked contemplation

434
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,619
And I know I threw a lot at you and some of it you're like why the hell, did we learn about that

435
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,090
well

436
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,090
keynotes are like that

437
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,869
But Reid Hoffman founder of LinkedIn Silicon Valley God

438
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,889
If you're not embarrassed by your first version your first product, you've shipped too late the point here is you can take a small step

439
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:15,619
Towards better hunting capabilities without a lot without a lot you have some data already you have some api's already you have some skills

440
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,399
