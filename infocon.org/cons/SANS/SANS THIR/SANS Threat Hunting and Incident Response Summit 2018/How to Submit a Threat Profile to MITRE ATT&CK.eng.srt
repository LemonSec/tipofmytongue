1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,003
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,612
(audience claps)

3
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,918
- This is just my story
about submitting a profile

4
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:23,923
to MITER ATT&CK and think
those folks are here.

5
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,961
I need to meet Katie

6
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:35,535
but quick disclaimer, I'm
not here in the name of

7
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,238
or speaking on behalf
of my employer.

8
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,673
All opinions here are
expressed are my own.

9
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:41,941
Just here to tell a story.

10
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:44,944
Okay, so a little
bit of background.

11
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,680
Like I said, I was a consultant.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,120
Did a lot of work doing
incident response in forensics.

13
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,795
I'm gonna talk about what
that was like before ATT&CK,

14
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:06,800
discovering ATT&CK, the
research that I did,

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:08,601
the submissions I made,

16
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,604
talk about indicators
and techniques

17
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:15,408
and some of the differences
between the IOCs and TTPs

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,609
and a few takeaways.

19
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,948
Okay, so it all began
for me in about 2010.

20
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:26,419
I went from doing forensics
work for law enforcement

21
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:32,459
to one of the big
consulting firms

22
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,862
and one of our clients
was repeatedly a victim.

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,668
We did a lot of incident
response all over the world.

24
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:47,006
We got to know how they
did what they did very well

25
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,810
but as happens in consulting,

26
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,314
you get different
clients, you move on.

27
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,082
That was kind of
a new thing for me

28
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:00,987
because in law enforcement,
as a forensic examiner,

29
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,992
you didn't just move on
until a case was closed

30
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:09,362
and the bad guy was
where he needed to be.

31
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:14,033
And so these guys kind of in
my view got a pass from that

32
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:22,308
so I never forgot really
about what they had done

33
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:29,048
to our client but life
moves on, four years go by,

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,619
and in those four years,

35
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,688
some things changed
for me personally.

36
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,262
I moved, got a new
job, got married,

37
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,565
and now I have three kids.

38
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,072
And if you don't know,
three is harder than two.

39
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,312
And both my bosses told
me to have fun today

40
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,880
so I hope we have
some fun today.

41
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,850
If you're married, you know
what I'm talking about,

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,951
having two bosses.

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,025
Okay, so four years went by
but I wanted to talk about

44
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,700
and share living through this
constant barrage of repeated

45
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,740
attacks and what it cost as far
as time and travel and work.

46
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,048
There just wasn't a lot
of things out there.

47
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,553
I could talk about it but I
couldn't really share much.

48
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,122
It felt like I was in the
dark ages or something

49
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,193
because there wasn't a
lot at this time in 2012

50
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:52,198
the best one I found was the
Mandiant, it was really great.

51
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:58,538
I shared this a lot but it was
one of two that I could find

52
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,510
that really, I think,
describe well enough

53
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,679
what was going on so to
me, it was the dark ages.

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,619
And so in May of 2015 when
the ATT&CK framework come out,

55
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:17,624
was published, I immediately
recognized its incredible start

56
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:26,065
a way to share how
adversaries behave.

57
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:32,372
And ATT&CK now has all
of these 11 tactics,

58
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,443
70 threat groups, 200
techniques, tools, but to me,

59
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,714
the most valuable thing
were the references.

60
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:46,719
That to me, was the
thing that stood out

61
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,490
because those references

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,026
and I'll talk about
this in a little bit,

63
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:57,897
they were pretty authoritative.

64
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,903
And so to me, the
dark ages were over

65
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,074
and information security to me

66
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,743
was the beginning
of the Renaissance.

67
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,278
When you talk about
the Renaissance,

68
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,247
you have to talk
about the Mona Lisa.

69
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,983
To me, ATT&CK is like
information security

70
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,384
entering the Renaissance.

71
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:22,555
So I saw it, I wanted
to be a part of it.

72
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,191
In August 2015, I emailed them.

73
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:28,027
They said, here's what you need.

74
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,263
You have public references that

75
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,032
associate the malware
to the threat group.

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,236
Do you have public
references that

77
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,306
associates the techniques
to the threat group?

78
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,310
And can these references be
linked to a definitive source?

79
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,813
And are they clear and not
open to interpretation?

80
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,051
I mean, it sounds pretty
similar coming from law

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,957
enforcement, I kinda knew
what they were asking for.

82
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,561
I thought about it a little
bit more and bottom line,

83
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,664
they basically just wanted
proof and what is proof,

84
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,132
it's simply evidence
of the truth.

85
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,633
And if you're former
law enforcement,

86
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,503
you know that evidence comes
from the Latin word provideo.

87
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,274
They wanted to see and
have it be obvious.

88
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,078
So nothing that you
had to interpret.

89
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:24,082
They wanted it to be
definitive and so they wanted,

90
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,888
after looking into it, a
little bit more detail.

91
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,758
They've since come out
with the philosophy paper

92
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,560
that details this even more.

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,931
If you haven't read
that, I recommend it.

94
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,301
Philosophy and design paper,
I think, June or July,

95
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,603
they came out with it

96
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,972
and they talk about
empirical evidence.

97
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,474
And for me, former
law enforcement,

98
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:52,512
empirical evidence that
supports your science-based

99
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,314
investigation, that is
your forensic evidence.

100
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,250
So light bulbs went off for me,

101
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,053
okay, they just
want some evidence.

102
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,089
But they wanted
empirical evidence

103
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,758
and empirical comes
from the word experience

104
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,495
so experience comes from
your sense so again,

105
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,432
they wanted to see and
have it be obvious.

106
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,672
It's hard to, video being
the best form of evidence.

107
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,376
It's hard to get, you don't
often get your adversaries

108
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,613
on video doing the
crime, it does happen.

109
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,818
Anybody seen the recent
Muller indictment?

110
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,087
Thanks to the Dutch
intelligence service,

111
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:39,859
they did actually catch them
on video, it does happen.

112
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,931
But in October, they came back.

113
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:49,101
They said, "don't think
there's enough public reporting

114
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:53,973
"to assert with high
confidence" of what I gave them.

115
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:58,611
They were right,
there wasn't a lot.

116
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,712
Most of what I knew
from my experiences

117
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:05,184
had not been made public
so I kinda knew some things

118
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,887
but I wasn't able to disclose.

119
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,658
And so they were right
to say we don't think so.

120
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,498
They said, we need to go
deeper and they were right

121
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:23,503
so back to the drawing board
but at the same exact time,

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,507
come to find out Mircon
is going on in DC 2015

123
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,877
and for the first time,

124
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:35,882
the threat group that I had
dealt with finally got a name.

125
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:40,886
FIN5, they finally
got definitively

126
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:44,155
associated with
their malware RawPOS

127
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:47,993
so for me, it was like
okay, case back open.

128
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,096
And another mention a day later,

129
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:55,067
I didn't close out my
case, I kept it open,

130
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:59,805
I kept occasionally looking,
there was new stuff.

131
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:04,709
That's one of my takeaways,
just have a little persistence.

132
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,715
If you find yourself
on the trail

133
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,586
of one of these threat groups,

134
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,559
they're the ones that
need to be afraid

135
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,459
if you have persistence.

136
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,664
They made a mistake, you caught
them, you're following them,

137
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,234
just keep watching,
you'll find more.

138
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,306
So a year later, in
GrrCon, this presentation,

139
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,576
attacking the hospitality
and gaming industries,

140
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,579
tracking an attacker around
the world in seven years,

141
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,050
it was a 55 minute talk,
it had tons of details.

142
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,154
So much detail that I reached
out to some former colleagues

143
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:53,159
who were still consulting and
they confirmed it's exactly,

144
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,560
they're talking about
the same person.

145
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,497
So Mandiant had been
dealing with the same group

146
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:03,502
that we were and so it was
really great confirmation

147
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,607
and the only thing that was
different was some of the names.

148
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,507
They liked to name
things differently

149
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,212
but after decoding that,
it became obvious again

150
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,681
that we were dealing
with the same group

151
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,485
and now I had some
information to add to mine.

152
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,055
Another thing he mentioned
in the talk that these guys

153
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:27,026
were in or around a
place called Hackerville.

154
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,460
Anybody heard of Hackerville?

155
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:34,867
It's a place in eastern
Europe, one of the towns that

156
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:41,239
is like the Ferrari
and Lamborghini
capital of the world.

157
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,476
These guys,

158
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:49,147
I'm not super upset
with these guys

159
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,851
but they're criminals,
they belong in jail

160
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:56,822
from my experience, they're
still out seven years later,

161
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,892
driving Ferraris,
I'm driving a Ford.

162
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,330
I'm not upset.

163
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,771
So they talk about
their everything,
their whole lifecycle

164
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,541
from compromise to
reconnaissance to
privilege escalation,

165
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,711
conducting their mission,
completing their mission.

166
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,615
It's all identical, I now
have a great reference point.

167
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,522
They use RawPOS, talk
about how they do it.

168
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:34,326
If it's RawPOS, it's FIN5,
authoritative, direct proof.

169
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,966
So I keep looking, I find more.

170
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,471
I had some of these because
they'd been around for so long.

171
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,039
I knew there was more out there

172
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,510
so I start looking some
more and I find more.

173
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,482
And so as an investigator, one
of your jobs is to keep sight

174
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,654
of the big picture just like
putting a puzzle together.

175
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,723
Anybody like puzzles?

176
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,991
All it takes is a
little bit of time,

177
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,462
a little bit of
connecting the dots.

178
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,298
So I took what I had, I
made sure they were linked,

179
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,868
but I come to find out there
were more, I was missing a few.

180
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,071
I added a few more,
I'm up to 14 now

181
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,341
and so the next thing I
do, I have a great picture.

182
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,176
It's coming together,
it's not all the way yet

183
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:28,380
so I keep looking, I go back
to that Mircon conference

184
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,249
and I look at who talked.

185
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:34,553
There's a great resource out
there called ConCollector.

186
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:39,558
It's a database that now
has around 50,000 speakers

187
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:47,366
and presenters covering
2,000 conferences

188
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,335
of the last 30 years.

189
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,937
It's a tremendous
resource for finding out

190
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,607
who has talked where on what.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,578
And Emmanuel and Barry, best
talk in hospitality industry,

192
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,550
APT in hospitality
and gaming industry.

193
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,051
This talk was never published

194
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,256
and these guys never
spoke again unfortunately.

195
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,859
But this talk Preston
Lewis and Matt Bromley,

196
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,161
they spoke again.

197
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:25,237
NolaCon last year in
fact was Matt Bromley's.

198
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,973
Talked about their use of PsExec

199
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,310
and what version it was,
had some great details,

200
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,247
and then Preston Lewis
talked about attacking

201
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,350
the hospitality and
gaming industries,

202
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,753
tracking an attacker around
the world in eight years.

203
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,757
And that was another great
talk, hour long talk almost,

204
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:49,093
full of details so I had
another great reference

205
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,565
so the picture is
coming together.

206
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,735
Just a little bit
of persistence.

207
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,742
Again, the lifecycle,
a lot of details.

208
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,080
Anybody notice any
additions to this?

209
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,117
It's hard to see.

210
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:18,123
So they are slow
to do many changes,

211
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,393
I was surprised they did
any 'cause it still works.

212
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:24,930
What they're doing is
still working since 2008

213
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,566
but they did change,

214
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,202
I guess things are
getting a little harder.

215
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,172
They added Mimikatz which
is latest greatest way

216
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:38,177
to capture credentials to
their escalating privileges.

217
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,314
They added HeidiSQL
for reconnaissance

218
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,052
and they are starting to
defeat single factor VPNs

219
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,988
for their initial access

220
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:52,124
so interesting additions
to their techniques.

221
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,329
Next thing I do to try
to finish this picture

222
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:02,133
so that it's pretty
obvious for them is

223
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:07,139
I use a tool called POC Parser
by Armand Buscher I believe.

224
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,877
His name, it's on
GitHub, it's great tool

225
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:15,781
if you want to extract IOCs
out of PDF files for example.

226
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,684
Here are the hashes I
got out of the reports.

227
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:23,689
So I started researching the
hashes just to keep going here.

228
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,292
These reports were good
but they were not great,

229
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,627
they were not the
smoking guns or anything.

230
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,632
So keep going, next thing I do
is I import all those hashes.

231
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:38,604
I'm still driving my Ford so
I'm mad but I'm not so mad

232
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,306
I'm gonna go through
every single hash

233
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,241
from every single report.

234
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,477
Obsession is not
required to do this.

235
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:46,978
It's just a little
bit of persistence.

236
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:51,817
So I found a shortcut so by,
I'm familiar with Multego,

237
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,753
it's a great tool if
you're not familiar.

238
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,991
It can handle CSVs and you
can do anything with it

239
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,160
to create a visual.

240
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,762
I created this, the
yellow are the reports

241
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,867
and the red are the hashes and
some of the red are bigger.

242
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,269
That's 'cause those are the ones

243
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,671
that are in multiple
reports so I focus on those.

244
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,375
Turns out more reports,
these guys have been around

245
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,978
a long time I knew there
was more out there.

246
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,247
These were definitive,
these were directly linked,

247
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:28,253
these were authoritative
so October 2017,

248
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,791
I felt I had enough to
make another submission.

249
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,565
Included 10 tactics, 14
techniques, from 30 references,

250
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,167
from 30 different
security organizations.

251
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,206
Carbon Black being one
of them, they were great.

252
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,074
So give a shout
out to our sponsor.

253
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:58,384
And they came back this
time and they published.

254
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,686
They published five at first.

255
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,656
There's now, I don't know
how many now up there,

256
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,627
at least 10 or so
but they covered,

257
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,964
I was pleased they covered
each stage in the lifecycle

258
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:17,970
and so now I felt like my
case was finally closed.

259
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,777
I have shared what cyber
criminals were doing,

260
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,413
how they were doing
it, and so now,

261
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,183
this is my way of doing that.

262
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,453
So some of my favorite
of the techniques

263
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,624
being a former law
enforcement forensic examiner,

264
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,362
the anti forensic
techniques were my favorite.

265
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,265
The removing of indicators,

266
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,667
that they would
delete the event logs.

267
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,003
At the time, that's all
you could do was delete,

268
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:55,974
you couldn't edit them like
you can now thanks to NSA.

269
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:59,278
Dumped by the, who was
it, the shadow brokers.

270
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,515
So a little bit
harder to tell now,

271
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,418
that was a big
giveaway at the time.

272
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,955
The other one was
encrypting their tool sets

273
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,960
so they would encrypt RAR
files full of all their tools

274
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,799
and that was
sometimes effective.

275
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,436
We usually could crack the
password but not always

276
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,572
so it was sometimes effective.

277
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:30,908
Time stomping at the time,
that was not super effective

278
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,914
because like on XP systems,
there're two sets of timestamps,

279
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,753
standard information attribute,

280
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,188
filename attribute
and at that time,

281
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,825
you could not change
the filename attribute

282
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,861
only the standard
information attribute

283
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,597
which is the timestamp
you saw on Windows.

284
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,600
The back up timestamp, there
was no way to change it

285
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,971
so they were simply hiding
from administrators basically

286
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,706
by changing these timestamps.

287
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,142
We had a tool we could run
a comparison, pretty quick,

288
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:09,148
and we could see what they
did stood out pretty quick.

289
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,386
Now, unfortunately,
there's tools,

290
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,687
there's ways to
change both timestamps

291
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,290
so it's a little bit harder now

292
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:23,362
if you're doing incident
response but there is a way

293
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:29,434
and I encourage vendors
to, especially EDR vendors,

294
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,740
to grab this information
when you change timestamps,

295
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,043
you're not changing
the entire time.

296
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:42,147
You're only changing the
minutes, seconds, hours.

297
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:45,384
You're not changing the
milliseconds or nanoseconds.

298
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,419
Those are zeroed out.

299
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:51,256
If you see zeroed out
nanoseconds that's an indicator

300
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,062
so EDR vendors,
take note please.

301
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,934
File deletion, so
they used SDelete,

302
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,037
it's a sysinternals
tool, Secure Delete.

303
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,674
It's very effective
because it didn't delete.

304
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,476
It overwrites and
once that happens,

305
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,911
there's no more evidence.

306
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:19,251
Okay, here's a graphic,
I just love this graphic.

307
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,355
It was recently on Twitter.

308
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,191
Guy by the name of Control
Commando put it out there.

309
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,194
I loved it because it shows that

310
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:35,367
not all techniques are
under just one tactic.

311
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,571
So different adversaries
use different techniques

312
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,805
for different tactics.

313
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:45,110
So I think that's just
important to note.

314
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,779
If you're trying to do
attribution with ATT&CK,

315
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,248
just keep that in mind.

316
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,784
ATT&CK will get you started

317
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,820
but it will not get
you all the way there.

318
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,825
So if you find yourself
encountering an adversary

319
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,995
and you think there's any
chance it's gonna happen again,

320
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,631
incident response best
practices say you need to get

321
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,035
the tools, the tactics,
the techniques right.

322
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:15,107
This NIST is from the
NIST best practices

323
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,277
and I recommend it
because it works.

324
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,078
We kept our client
out of the news

325
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,848
because we got their TTPs.

326
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,783
We knew what they were
gonna do before they did it

327
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,352
so we could watch for them.

328
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:30,088
We saw them start to
complete their mission,

329
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,258
we would cut them off
before they could finish.

330
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,928
If you're sharing, if
you're intelligence

331
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,364
and you're sharing cyber
threat intelligence,

332
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,268
intelligence is more
than indicators.

333
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,137
Intelligence
includes the tactics,

334
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,605
techniques, and procedures.

335
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:54,079
Everybody knows David
Bianco, pyramid of pain.

336
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,982
I just love this slide.

337
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:01,586
This has been out how
long now, five years now.

338
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,655
It's awesome, thank you.

339
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,062
This shows where ATT&CK lives,
the ATT&CK framework lives.

340
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:15,300
It lives up there in the TTPs
that are so hard to change.

341
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,235
That's why when
you get those TTPs,

342
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,007
you can predict what they're
gonna do with some accuracy

343
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,976
because it's hard for them
to change these things.

344
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,879
Hash values are trivial.

345
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,817
IP addresses, right, easy.

346
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,221
Little bit more about
hashes in a second.

347
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:43,128
And Joe Slowik, he has
done some posts recently

348
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,098
talking about indicators

349
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:50,802
and how they essentially
expire immediately now.

350
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,942
It used to be they were
useful for a little while

351
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,114
and I think that's,
if that was ever true,

352
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,783
that's no longer
true, unfortunately

353
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:08,919
and Threat Connect said the
same thing not long ago.

354
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,557
Guy by the name
of Wade Baker who,

355
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:19,097
if anybody's familiar
with the Verizon DBIR,

356
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,500
the Data Breach
Investigations Report,

357
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,802
he helped spearhead that.

358
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,272
That's a great report, been
reading that for years.

359
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,010
I love that report
because it's based on

360
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,680
that empirical
forensic evidence also.

361
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:44,456
But IOCs again,
not lasting long.

362
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,828
Hash values, if anybody's
heard of Webroot.

363
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,033
They now have one of the largest
hash databases available.

364
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,639
For the last 3 years,

365
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:04,141
over 90% of malware has only
been seen at one endpoint.

366
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:11,116
So it's really brief,
really narrow shelf-life

367
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,385
for hash values in particular.

368
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,391
So don't count on an IOC
getting you out of trouble.

369
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,729
Okay, adversary emulation.

370
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:30,735
It's another great use case
for the ATT&CK framework.

371
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,838
I was kinda skeptical
about this at first.

372
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:37,408
Like, how you gonna
pretend to be an adversary.

373
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,178
You don't know what an
adversary's gonna do.

374
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,981
Well if you know their TTPs,

375
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,817
you can't just
change those easily.

376
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:50,822
You can absolutely can
IOCs are backward looking,

377
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,126
TTPs are forward looking

378
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,363
so you absolutely can
in a meaningful way now

379
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:03,301
thanks to how empirically
supported these techniques are,

380
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:08,572
it is absolutely
something you can do

381
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,409
and they're in the
process of in fact

382
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,514
testing a lot of the
EDR vendors right now.

383
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,183
And I very much look
forward to those results

384
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,920
'cause those are gonna
show who can detect what.

385
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:30,160
It's very exciting to be
part of the Renaissance here.

386
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:40,872
There's only I think two
and correct me if I'm wrong,

387
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,042
there's two I think
categories of things

388
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,279
there's still vendors out
there who want to spread

389
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,048
and sow on your fear,
uncertainty and doubt.

390
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:55,419
Well, there's still a couple
of things to worry about.

391
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,126
One of them are things
that are not in ATT&CK yet.

392
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,097
The second, our adversaries
like this for example

393
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:10,068
who are in this case APT29,

394
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,804
which I know some of you
are very familiar with,

395
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:16,308
and I wanna talk to you later
if you know more than me

396
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,746
but here's an example
of how bad it can get.

397
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,550
If they're determined
and they're persistent

398
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,052
and they're not giving up,

399
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,155
it can take months to get
them out of your systems

400
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,258
and this is just an example
of worst case scenario

401
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,492
I recently read about.

402
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:37,796
David Sanger had
a book recently,

403
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,331
I don't know if
anybody's read it,

404
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,767
called The Perfect Weapon,
talks about this situation

405
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:51,276
and anybody, Rob Joyce from NSA,

406
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,548
he talked about this
at DEF CON this year.

407
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,952
It was in the book, it was
called A Digital Dogfight.

408
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,724
Incident responders
had very rough time

409
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,659
with getting them
out and I don't know

410
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:13,665
if it is this talk by
Mandiant, excuse me, FireEye

411
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,004
but this talk was
about APT29 as well.

412
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,107
Very interesting talk, I
recommend you check it out.

413
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:27,112
It's a very amazing, from
incident responder's standpoint,

414
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,984
very cool story, Nick Carr
and Matthew Dunwoody from

415
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,823
Mandiant, given this talk
a couple times I think now.

416
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,128
It's really amazing
what they can do

417
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,801
so if you run into an
organization bigger than yours,

418
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,736
it's okay to call for
help, I recommend you call.

419
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,506
There's two I can
recommend to you.

420
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,245
FireEye and also CrowdStrike,

421
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,246
they're two of the
incident response firms.

422
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,582
The only two in the
world that are both

423
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:08,753
accredited by the NSA and
by the payment card industry

424
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,723
so they're in the news a lot

425
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,091
because they do a
lot of good work.

426
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,164
So call for help if you need it.

427
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,066
In the meantime,
I recommend you,

428
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,070
if you run into an attacker,

429
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,839
recover what they're doing,
recover the evidence.

430
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,442
If your forensics guys aren't

431
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,977
drawing you that
picture, get them to.

432
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,016
If they can't do it,
get outside folks.

433
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:42,487
You can determine how your
attacker likes to operate.

434
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,223
You can get, ever
hear of left of boom?

435
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,928
You can get left of them and
David Sanger in his book talks

436
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:53,698
about left of launch which I
thought was pretty interesting.

437
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,600
Talking about the North
Korean missile launch

438
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,204
and how we actually apparently

439
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,975
stopped some of those
with electronic means.

440
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,511
Pretty interesting,

441
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,747
so just a little
persistence is all you need

442
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,449
to put together
that hard evidence

443
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,487
that can be now be shared
thanks to the ATT&CK framework.

444
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,491
So get out there, share, if
you run across something,

445
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,126
let us all know about it.

446
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:24,529
Alright, thank you very
much, appreciate it.

447
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,265
(audience claps)

448
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,101
(suspenseful music)
