1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:03,870
(electronic music)

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,179
(applause)

3
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:18,218
- Thank you for being here,
thank you for taking time.

4
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:23,223
I understand exactly how much
time, like, our time is worth.

5
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,724
So we're gonna talk
about that today.

6
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,527
We're gonna talk about
shortening some cycles,

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,262
gonna talk about
finding evil faster.

8
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,765
We're gonna have a whole
discussion around normal.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,003
I love this motto.

10
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,540
It's four simple words,
but how hard is it

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,942
to actually know normal?

12
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,478
How hard is it to
actually find evil?

13
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,380
A lot of us in this
room, understand

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,050
how hard that equation
actually becomes.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,285
We spend a whole lot
of time chasing normal,

16
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,889
lookin' for evil,
only to, in the end,

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,092
find something that
looks exactly like
an APP, but it's not.

18
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,994
And we're gonna talk about a
bunch of those examples today,

19
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,396
and how we can start,
as a community,

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,697
put this intelligence together

21
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,332
in a way that we can all use.

22
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,967
Sound good?

23
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,536
Awesome.

24
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,738
Look, the journey
at Carbon Black

25
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,807
really started with one premise,

26
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,842
centrally collect
the right data,

27
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,510
to rewind the tape on attacks.

28
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,815
But as we started this
journey, we started to realize

29
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,086
that collecting all of that
date doesn't necessarily mean

30
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,620
you can determine normal faster.

31
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,457
In fact, when you start to
collect all of this data,

32
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,357
the more you actually
start to look at it,

33
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,561
the more abnormal
everything becomes.

34
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,230
I'm gonna talk about some
of those examples today,

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,666
and I'll give you, one
of our brief hypothesis

36
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,167
that we started with
that was quickly

37
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,635
myth-busted along the journey.

38
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,339
We thought when we
started, that binaries

39
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,908
on an endpoint would
stabilize over time.

40
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,646
Actually not true, they
continue to linerally increase.

41
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,149
Like, why does a user
continue to need executables

42
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,084
when they can do
their job on a thing?

43
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,619
That still continues to happen.

44
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,222
We wasted a lot of time.

45
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,259
During our engagements,
we found a lot of normal

46
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,161
at the tail end of our chain.

47
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,929
And it turns out
none of it was evil,

48
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,298
but we wasted a
whole lot of time.

49
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,967
So what we're gonna
talk about today,

50
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,902
is how we can
apply those lessons

51
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,803
back to what you're
doing in your program,

52
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,806
and hopefully inspire this
community to get together

53
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,608
to help fix some of this stuff.

54
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,376
'Cause I'm tired of wasting time

55
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,345
chasing good,
known applications.

56
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,615
Anybody else tired of chasing
good, known applications?

57
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,118
At CCM it was a pain, so we'll
talk a little bit about that.

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,889
But now we're gonna
talk about evil.

59
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,126
When we start, we generally ask
ourselves, is this abnormal?

60
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,562
I.e. a thing happened.

61
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,230
Maybe it was an alert,
maybe we started an instant

62
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,298
response engagement,
maybe we're out hunting.

63
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:49,702
But we start with that
hypothesis, is this abnormal?

64
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,139
Then we start to say to
ourselves, is this normal?

65
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,745
The intersection of both becomes
a very interesting place.

66
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,847
And we start to pay
attention to these things,

67
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,817
we start to realize that
abnormal and normal overlap

68
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,587
all the time, and the buckets
we use to define those,

69
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,221
are probably a little incorrect.

70
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,792
This year, some great
work has been done

71
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,730
to help actually find
evil, and that work,

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,631
thank you MITRE, by the way.

73
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,734
Carbon Black is a huge
fan of what happened

74
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,169
with MITRE ATT&CK.

75
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,838
We actually have a taxonomy,
that's understandable,

76
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:29,642
updatable, and relatable
back to the kill chain.

77
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,045
So now we understand the TTPs

78
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,415
mapped out to the
entire kill chain.

79
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:37,784
This helps us start to
focus on evil faster.

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,120
But what happens when you
start to overlay this data,

81
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,458
is you get a massive
amount of false positives.

82
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,927
We can tell you this, because
we created a watch list

83
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,462
which maps back to ATT&CK MITRE,

84
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,929
so if you're a Carbon
Black customer,

85
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,599
that'll be available
in, like, a week.

86
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,435
In GA we have a beta
program right now,

87
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,238
there's a number of false
positives go through the roof.

88
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,574
And this is the problem,
while it allows us

89
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,209
to focus on attacker behavior,

90
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,647
we are still left with
this giant amount of noise.

91
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,149
And it becomes, what I
like to refer to it as

92
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,785
finding the needle
in the needle stack.

93
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,821
So when we take
all of that away,

94
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,356
we're left with all
this noise, still.

95
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,692
Is it a print queue,
or is it the Russians?

96
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,996
I don't know, we've gotta
figure that out faster, right?

97
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,631
Can't find evil, unless
we can get through

98
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,965
the cycle of knowing
normal, faster.

99
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,575
Abnormal and normal
are intertwined,

100
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,477
they're in a relationship
with each other.

101
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,811
It depends on how
you analyze data,

102
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,281
and I'll give you an example.

103
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,017
Is notepad.exe at 10am,

104
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,986
like, if you
observe the behavior

105
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:50,156
of that binary at 10am,
it may look one way.

106
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:52,959
But if you do it at 10am
and 10pm, it's gonna change.

107
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,661
If you do it every 10
seconds, it's gonna change,

108
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,730
if you do it every one
second, it's gonna change.

109
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,234
Abnormal is based on
your observations.

110
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,637
So now we're gonna
talk a little bit about

111
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,506
the levels of abnormal
that are out there.

112
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,773
They exist all over the place.

113
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,809
When you start looking
at endpoint behavior,

114
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,245
you start to
quickly realize that

115
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,447
there is process abnormalities.

116
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,549
There are system abnormalities,

117
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,484
memory based abnormalities,
and certainly users

118
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,721
have abnormalities
all the time, right.

119
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,457
Some of you guys can
probably relate to this.

120
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,359
What does this all mean?

121
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:30,330
It really means that
you have to understand

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,966
each one of these to
actually understand normal.

123
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,302
And if you can get
to know that normal,

124
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,705
all of these get
removed, then the focus

125
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,139
becomes just finding evil.

126
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,609
If we can spend our
time just finding evil,

127
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,445
if we can get through the
cycle of knowing normal faster,

128
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,048
I think we have a
chance of getting down

129
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,018
to a reasonable time to
actually defend our systems.

130
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,785
Like, if we don't,
and we continue to do

131
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,321
what we've done as an industry,

132
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,957
we are gonna continue
to have a problem.

133
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,659
I mean look, Gardner says it's
180 days meantime to detect.

134
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,129
I think Verizon last
year, said it was 211.

135
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:08,134
When I started in 1998,
the number was 369 days.

136
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,472
So, at best, in 20 years,
we've gotten six months better.

137
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,474
It's not a good statistic, like,

138
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,944
that's just not a good
look, as an industry, right.

139
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,281
So now, let's talk about how
we bucket normal and evil.

140
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,419
Today, we generally
use two buckets.

141
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,955
We say something is normal,
therefore it's benign.

142
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,258
Or something is abnormal,
therefore it's evil.

143
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,861
But as an industry, how
do we figure that out?

144
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,430
We start to use frequency
analysis, right.

145
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,399
'Cause frequency
analysis tells us,

146
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,968
if it happens frequently,
it's probably good.

147
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,037
If it happens infrequently,
it's probably bad,

148
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,438
because that's your outlier.

149
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,743
We think that's bad, we
think we should actually

150
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,445
focus on infrequent
and malicious.

151
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,782
Not frequency being
the indicator.

152
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:56,883
And we think the
table's gonna look

153
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,817
a little bit more like this.

154
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,624
Normal things act
evil all the time.

155
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,827
Look, if you watch
any of the cool talks

156
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,431
on evading antivirus,
what you'll quickly see

157
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,965
is none of the
attackers are actually

158
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,334
dropping binaries anymore,
at least the good ones.

159
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,603
They're all using
good, known processes.

160
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,940
Whether that's PowerShell,
WMI, all of these things.

161
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,141
So, normal stuff acts evil.

162
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,309
Why, because I approved it.

163
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,677
I approved that application.

164
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,212
When somebody submitted
that, this application

165
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,247
come up my network, and I
was the CCO, I approve that.

166
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,717
So guess what,
it's a normal evil.

167
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,286
In a Dungeons & Dragons sense,

168
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,154
it looks a little
bit more like this.

169
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,391
And apps operate like
that all the time.

170
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,928
There's chaotic
good apps, like CCM,

171
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,094
that just stray things
all over the place

172
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,598
and network connections
like crazy, right.

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,668
You have abnormal benign
things, like an increase in x,

174
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,169
where something changes
in your environment,

175
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,538
but it's completely benign
and you chased it down.

176
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,840
It's a lot of time wasted.

177
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,276
So look, here's
what we're gonna do.

178
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,878
I've never seen a
Keynote do this,

179
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,246
we're gonna play a game today.

180
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,048
Everybody ready to play a game?

181
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:02,982
- [Audience Member] Yeah.

182
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,417
- It should be pretty awesome.

183
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,085
The game's gonna be
called, evil or not evil.

184
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,986
I'm gonna give you some
examples of things that happen,

185
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,922
give you the front
end of the chain.

186
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,390
I want you to think about it,

187
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,693
you don't have to shout answers,
we're gonna think about it,

188
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,861
we're gonna walk
these in our head.

189
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,029
We'll give you an
example of where we won,

190
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,866
and were actually right, and
where we failed in our hunt.

191
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,870
Alright, evil or not evil.

192
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,573
You get an alert, or maybe
a watch list hit that says

193
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:31,043
your SAM file was
accessed and scraped.

194
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,345
Is that evil, or not evil?

195
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:40,819
Well if you go to MITRE ATT&CK,
oh look pwdump does that,

196
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,456
mimikatz does that, so
it must be evil, right.

197
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,325
I like that answer.

198
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,460
(muffled talking)

199
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,495
Yeah, what's the
context of that, right?

200
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,964
What's the context,
like, what are

201
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,232
the parent things
that kicked that off?

202
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,805
In this particular case,
we were assuming evil.

203
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,575
That shouldn't happen right?

204
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,810
But it turns out, we were wrong.

205
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,079
And it was completely normal.

206
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,180
You know what does
this all the time?

207
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,016
Adobe updater.

208
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,552
You know what
Adobe updater does?

209
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,420
It like, watches all
of these processes

210
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,521
so it can stay up and running.

211
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,857
And from Adobe's perspective,

212
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,358
that probably makes
perfect sense.

213
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,560
I mean, after all, they've
sold billions of dollars

214
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,430
of software, and their
software stays up all the time.

215
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,698
From our perspective,
we're like,

216
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,068
hey Adobe, maybe you
don't need to do that.

217
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,437
Maybe you can create two
processes, an A and a B,

218
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,139
with shared view texts
and just watch each other,

219
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,777
and if it fails, get out of
what the adversaries do, right.

220
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,045
So now in this particular case,

221
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,913
the red balloon is not evil.

222
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,115
A child just lost
his red balloon.

223
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,617
But that wasted a ton of time.

224
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,188
Alright, here we go, next up.

225
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:53,326
Notepad.exe makes a
netcom, good or bad?

226
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,462
Supposed to happen, 'cause
I was told for years

227
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,699
Notepad never makes network
connections unless it's evil.

228
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,141
Oh, but wait, if I use file
shares, and I'm a user,

229
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,111
and I open a text file from a
file share, well guess what.

230
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,614
Notepad makin' netcoms
all over the place.

231
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,050
Context becomes
everything to determine

232
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,318
whether it's evil or not.

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,255
In this particular case,
when you start to trace it,

234
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,226
you start to see that
the parent process

235
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,796
is actually cpuchecker.exe.

236
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,532
And our tell team discovered

237
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,970
a brand new piece of monera
mining software, a used Notepad

238
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,742
to connect back, and
start the mining process.

239
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,977
So is it bad that notepad.exe
makes connections?

240
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,245
No, that's gonna
happen everyday.

241
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,214
I'm guess unless you
get rid of the Notepad

242
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,015
in that environment, right?

243
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,417
But injection's
happening all the time,

244
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,952
and the context
becomes everything.

245
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:54,520
If you don't have the
visibility and you can

246
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,322
put that picture together,
you're just gonna miss it

247
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,326
and assume things, and
honestly waste a lot of time.

248
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,129
I'm gonna reiterate
that a few times.

249
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,964
What's my part in here.

250
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,699
Oh, this is a good one.

251
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:11,036
MSBuild, I hate
MSBuild right now.

252
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,339
MSBuild got put on
every Windows 10 box.

253
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,242
And MSBuild, and I'll
tell you right now,

254
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,911
if you work in a
company that doesn't

255
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,113
have a lot of engineers, and
you see MSBuild activity,

256
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,748
like, immediately
look into that.

257
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,117
So, we'll just skip the
part where we play the game,

258
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,319
and say, if you don't have
engineers building things

259
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,088
you shouldn't have
MSBuild running.

260
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,824
What's the problem with MSBuild?

261
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,194
Is it evil, is it not evil?

262
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,464
Like, how often
should that happen,

263
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,666
when the parent process
isn't Visual Studio?

264
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,336
These are questions
we all have to answer

265
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,304
when we're not hunting, right,

266
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,039
when we're doing IR engagements.

267
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,174
So, what's that answer?

268
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,677
The answer becomes,
context becomes everything.

269
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:56,482
MSBuild will make all kinds
of network connections,

270
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,918
because most of the
time, developers are

271
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,154
compiling things on
the network, right.

272
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,056
They're so scored repositories
are getting a lot of network,

273
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,991
so guess what, I might as
well go, netcon, netcon,

274
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,794
it's gonna look like lateral
movement all over the place.

275
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,662
So, is it evil?

276
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,499
In this particular case,
there's a whole lot of activity,

277
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,201
but it was abnormal and benign.

278
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,602
We throw a whole
bunch of red balloons

279
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,771
when it turns out
it wasn't, however,

280
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,375
Joe Casazza from Red Canary
is presenting at lunch,

281
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,911
he's gonna deep dive into
MSBuild and why it's bad,

282
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,414
but just to tee up
his talk a little bit,

283
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,083
I can make anything run,
I can make mimikatz run

284
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,618
and it's gonna launch,
that's MSBuild, right.

285
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,288
But that activity that
it does, the behaviors

286
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,225
that are expressed by
MSBuild post that happening,

287
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,160
we should have visibility
to, and be able to stop.

288
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,261
That's how you're
gonna determine

289
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,863
whether it's
actually evil or not.

290
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,866
Alright, one of
my favorite ones.

291
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,935
Powershell.exe starts
making network connections

292
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,737
that are boxes.

293
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,741
Evil, not evil?

294
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,780
You gotta make a call,
come on, we got like,

295
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,249
two minutes, when we
triage this stuff, right.

296
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,950
Alright, he's in
the camp of evil.

297
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,522
I'm in the camp of evil
too, 'cause PowerShell's

298
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,689
pretty awesome.

299
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,992
I mean look, we've
seen it rise ever since

300
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,360
PowerShell empire
came out, right.

301
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,861
There's droppers every where.

302
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,564
It's pretty awesome the stuff
you can do with PowerShell.

303
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,366
My system administrators,
however, would tell me

304
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,667
don't be on PowerShell.

305
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,170
Like, we can't do our
job without PowerShell.

306
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,104
I can't do data
center automation,

307
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,140
I can't do rebuilds
of endpoints.

308
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,909
I can't do any of
that stuff because

309
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,112
we've built our entire
operations around PowerShell.

310
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,747
So good luck
banning that, right.

311
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,317
How do I determine whether
PowerShell doin' something,

312
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,187
making a network connection
to a new box, is good or bad?

313
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,456
That's the life
we live, those are

314
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,492
the questions we have to answer.

315
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,727
But if I had that,
what I'm gonna refer to

316
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,898
as normal intelligence, and
we treated it like we do

317
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,235
with adversarial threat
intelligence, as a community,

318
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,338
like, we exchanged
it, we talk about it,

319
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,674
we've got a place to go
find this stuff together,

320
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,975
that's where we need to be.

321
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,244
Because this cycle
becomes shorter then.

322
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,313
I certainly know
what it was like

323
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,881
when I actually had a real job,

324
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,284
and this would happen,
we had trouble.

325
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,120
Spreadsheets, I had
text messages to people

326
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,156
who were way smarter than me.

327
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,590
You know, hey Ben, have
you seen this before,

328
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,159
Mike, have you seen this before?

329
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,361
How many of us live in that
world, where it's like,

330
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,829
is this, I gotta make the call,

331
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,464
is it actually evil,
or is it good, right.

332
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,700
And we err on the side of not

333
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,202
interrupting the
user all the time.

334
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,038
So we have to walk
that razor line,

335
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,341
as responders and threat
hunters all the time.

336
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,310
'Cause I can tell you
what it's like to be

337
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,579
in an engineering company,
when you developer

338
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,348
from actually being able
to push out a binary

339
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,717
that sells millions of
dollars worth of stuff,

340
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,086
it's gonna be a bad day
for you in that seat.

341
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:51,090
So, in this particular
case, it's abnormal, benign,

342
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,993
because uh oh, it was
my system administrators

343
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,596
orchestrating things
on endpoints, right.

344
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,599
You have to see the behaviors
of something like PowerShell.

345
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,434
And I was gonna swap this out,
and I'm sure a couple people

346
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,704
in my company would be upset
that I didn't with WMI.

347
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:09,007
And I'm gonna briefly add one
to this list, which is WMI,

348
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,342
and it's gonna fall
in the same category.

349
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:13,812
If you look at WMI, and
how it actually works,

350
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,347
SCCM is gonna spray that out.

351
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,814
So if you have SCCM
in your environment,

352
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,284
you're gonna have to know that.

353
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,319
You're gonna have to know
how WMI actually looks

354
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,488
to find it when it's being evil.

355
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,857
So, just know that the bad
guys know that we're after

356
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,891
PowerShell, and they've
already moved on to WMI.

357
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,295
So, expect a lot of lateral
movement to be that.

358
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,031
Alright, I'm gonna
go to the last one.

359
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,534
Dllhost.exe.

360
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,540
When is it okay for
dllhost.exe to kick off

361
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,844
something like a command
interpreter, like,

362
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,446
I'll just use cmd.exe (mumbles).

363
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,920
This one, I didn't come
here to give answers.

364
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,823
'Cause, ultimately, no
one has all the answers

365
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,526
when it comes to this
game, but as a group,

366
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,227
we're really smart.

367
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:03,963
We can start to put
this data together,

368
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,564
and start to talk to each other.

369
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,565
And vendors can stop competing

370
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,235
on things like false
positive rates.

371
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,004
I think we're gonna
get better on that.

372
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,940
So in this particular
case, I don't know.

373
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,542
We've got a whole bunch
more investigating to do.

374
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,644
But how much time did we
waste until we actually get

375
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,613
an answer on whether or
not this is normal behavior

376
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,882
for an approved application
in my environment.

377
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:29,922
This is extremely hard.

378
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,491
We wanna help.

379
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,928
We wanna help all
of you in this room,

380
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,862
because we've seen what happens

381
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,063
when a community gets together.

382
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,497
If you're a customer
of Carbon Black,

383
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,200
you're part of
the user exchange,

384
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,469
and this happens
on a daily basis.

385
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,205
Defenders exchanging
information with defenders,

386
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,041
and actually getting
through these cycles faster.

387
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,643
As a community, we need
that, it cannot be exclusive

388
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,246
to one organization, and
one set of customers.

389
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,682
'Cause no vendor out there is
gonna sell a hundred percent

390
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,685
of the market, it's just
not gonna happen, right.

391
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,387
So, if we continue to
hoard that information,

392
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,123
we continue to not give
it away as a community,

393
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,126
we are doing a disservice
to ourselves as a company.

394
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,728
Imagine a world without
all of this noise,

395
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,163
and third party applications.

396
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,766
Imagine a world, where
we could actually

397
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,503
help to educate major
software vendors,

398
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:20,271
that their applications
look exactly like an APT.

399
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:24,076
Imagine a world, and some
of you may actually work

400
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,778
for a major software
manufacturer.

401
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:28,012
You may actually be
able to influence

402
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,947
this problem in your company.

403
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,317
But imagine a world,
where you have to approve

404
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,153
a new application
comin' in, and you can

405
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,022
look the vendor in
the face, and say

406
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,358
do you trigger any
of MITRE ATT&CK?

407
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,629
So, now I know, right
at the beginning of it.

408
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,597
They don't actually know
that what they're doing

409
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,267
is causing us pain
and wasting time.

410
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,935
What they're doing,
from their perspective,

411
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,905
makes perfect sense,
'cause their binaries work.

412
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,208
Look, Microsoft has sold
a lot of binaries, right.

413
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,343
We have to help educate them.

414
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,479
We really do, like, that's
a big part of our job.

415
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:04,383
They don't know that all
this noise lands on us

416
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,552
and we've got to cut through it.

417
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,088
So we all have work
to do as a community.

418
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,355
What we need to start
doing, is linking

419
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,257
application software development

420
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,992
with threat hunting
and incident response,

421
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,594
and feed that back over to them.

422
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,300
Here's what Carbon Black would
like to do about all of this.

423
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,636
We would like to provide MITRE
with good, known binaries

424
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:29,207
and false positives for every
single TTP in MITRE ATT&CK.

425
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,745
So, imagine having a
repository where you can go

426
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,581
and quickly rule out whether
it's a false positive.

427
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,585
Where you can start to manage

428
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,587
normal intelligence
in your environment.

429
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,423
We wanna help developers
do the right thing,

430
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,491
stop yelling at them.

431
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,160
We need to get into their world,

432
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,661
and they need to
get into our world.

433
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,897
We gotta get together, and get
a little weird for a while.

434
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,765
We wanna reduce
false positive rates

435
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,336
for everybody in the
industry, not just ourselves.

436
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,439
Look, I'll stay on
the stage and say

437
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,274
I've never worked
for another vendor.

438
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,610
I came here because of
Carbon Black's vision,

439
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,578
I came here, because
of a mission,

440
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,081
but more importantly,
I came here,

441
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,551
it's fundamental to the
company, we are defenders.

442
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,553
Like, we do this on a daily
basis, and we live with the pain

443
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,090
on a daily basis,
so we understand it.

444
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,326
We want to save everybody time.

445
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,329
You know, Ben has
talked about this,

446
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,298
JJ talked about this last year.

447
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,536
One of the most precious
commodities we have, is time.

448
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,305
They're giving us
more money, right.

449
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:36,642
We're at 98 billion dollar
market cap now, in this period.

450
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,679
That has grown
extremely, since 1998.

451
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,147
They're giving us more money.

452
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,083
They are giving us more people.

453
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,685
Now granted, everyone
I've talked to says

454
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,187
six to nine months to
actually get someone

455
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,522
in the seat, trained
to be effective.

456
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,058
We need to start
cutting that down,

457
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,626
'cause our army ain't
gettin' big fast enough.

458
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,828
Look, I work with
Universities all the time,

459
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,732
we're not graduating
people fast enough, right.

460
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,167
So we have to do
something different.

461
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,735
This idea that we can continue
to make linear progress

462
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,307
and get .1% better on
efficacy or detection

463
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,809
is just not the world
we can live with.

464
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,412
Most of the people in this room

465
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,314
are quite aware of what's
happening across the world.

466
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,850
Geopolitically, cyberworld-wise,
all of those things.

467
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:25,057
We now have nation state tools
makin' the common ransomware.

468
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,125
That's the world we live
in, and we gotta change it.

469
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,828
We continue to do this thing,
where we make linear progress,

470
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,530
but it's not gonna get better.

471
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,732
Ultimately, we're gonna
be the ones stuck with it.

472
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,533
We're gonna be the ones
at 3am triagin' it,

473
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,102
and trying to figure
it out for our company,

474
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,571
whether or not we just lost
millions out the front door.

475
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,575
So I'm gonna call this
normal intelligence for now,

476
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,577
you can pick on me all you want.

477
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,079
We can come up with
a different name.

478
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,148
I really don't care, as long
as the effort gets done.

479
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,017
What I wanna challenge
everyone with in this room,

480
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,688
vendors, competitors, defenders,

481
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,257
let's go fix this
as a community.

482
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,126
We have seen the power of
community at Carbon Black.

483
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,695
We want that for all of
us, not just our customers.

484
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,066
So let's stop competing on
this stuff, it's intelligence.

485
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,335
We have spent so much time
on threat intelligence

486
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,837
and looking at
adversarial behaviors,

487
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,407
that we have ignored
our home-field
advantage for too long.

488
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,109
For far too long,
we've given up.

489
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,178
I've sat in the room with
major CISOs who've said,

490
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,614
asset managements is
never gonna happen.

491
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,483
Not if you give up.

492
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,418
Look, I'm a cynic too,
I don't think you can

493
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,453
work in security
and not be a cynic.

494
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,955
But if you give
up from the start

495
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,058
and say something can never
happen, it will never happen.

496
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,094
We in this room
are this community.

497
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,098
Like, you know I spent time
talking to Phil this morning,

498
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,233
and I asked him about the growth

499
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,135
of this particular event.

500
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,770
Like, have we seen
as threat hunters,

501
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,972
and incident
responders, more people

502
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,874
wanting to get in this game.

503
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,676
The answer is yes,
it's one of the most

504
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,811
rapidly growing
summits that SANS has.

505
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,514
That's awesome.

506
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,916
So guess what, we
are the leaders.

507
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,618
Like, we are the community.

508
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,254
We need to remember
that, especially

509
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,588
when it comes to
vendors out there.

510
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,123
We can drive change.

511
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,394
So imagine the world
without the noise.

512
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,301
How much easier would
it be if we could

513
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,003
rule out a false
positive, faster.

514
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,406
How much easier
would it be to say,

515
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:25,844
oh, this is normal
behavior for WMI net ccm.

516
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,746
And oh, by the way, I'm gonna go

517
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,580
share that out in the community.

518
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,383
So, Carbon Black is committed to

519
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,319
setting up a slack
channel around this,

520
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,955
so that you can ask
questions for normal.

521
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:38,657
Now, I couldn't commit every
resource in the company

522
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,592
to manning that, but Mike
Mascuzza, the CTO of the company

523
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,428
has guaranteed that
we will man that

524
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,764
for an hour, one day a week.

525
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,033
What we're asking
is for anybody else

526
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,334
that wants to participate, man
another hour during the week.

527
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:53,171
It's just an hour, put a
couple of your experts in there

528
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,973
so we can exchange normal,
start talking about it,

529
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,442
rule the stuff out
fast in the community.

530
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,410
'Cause the conversations
are happening

531
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,212
in our UEX, and it's awesome.

532
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,615
But that's only gonna impact
Carbon Black customers.

533
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,318
We want to impact
the entire industry.

534
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,588
I didn't come into
this industry, to like,

535
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,490
make incremental
change, and I certainly

536
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,159
didn't come to a vendor
like Carbon Black,

537
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,028
who has the ability to
lead, and the willingness

538
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,297
to actually stand up and lead.

539
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,899
We could hoard this information.

540
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,604
We certainly could, and keep
our false positive rates low.

541
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:26,838
We know that some
of this information

542
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,874
is probably gonna
help our competitors

543
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,042
like, we're fully aware of that.

544
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,276
We don't care, why?

545
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,212
'Cause it makes
your life better,

546
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,747
and we have to have
that commitment.

547
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,416
The leaders in this
industry, have got to

548
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,751
have that commitment,
and as a community,

549
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,921
we've got to stand up and
demand that from our vendor.

550
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,758
So again, imagine your
world without this noise.

551
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,593
How much faster
can we find evil?

552
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,132
Oh, this all sounds great,
Rick, sounds awesome.

553
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,535
But, but, but, we've heard
things like this before.

554
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:58,904
Yeah, you probably have.

555
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,274
Hey, but wait, wouldn't
this give adversaries

556
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,810
a roadmap for how
to evade technology?

557
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,678
Yeah, but guess what,
they're right now, how.

558
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,214
I mean look, some
of us in the room

559
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,149
can't actually go and do it,
but if you go look at things

560
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,517
like marble and
grasshopper, and you know,

561
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,454
some of these vault seven
and vault, they already know.

562
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,288
They already know.

563
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,226
I don't think we should
be held up by but.

564
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,664
It's a terrible way
to hold yourself up.

565
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,399
But, but, but, but, but.

566
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,234
Arguing about edge cases.

567
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,903
Can we do something
about this problem.

568
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,939
I mean, for once as a community,
agree this is a problem,

569
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,508
and actually do something
about it, and get together.

570
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,944
I sit on a whole lot of
committees with other

571
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,312
vendors and competitors in
a space and it gets weird.

572
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,249
And let me tell you
something, the adversary,

573
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,885
they don't care
about our politics.

574
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,621
They don't care about who
owns the market space,

575
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,256
or who's the best vendor, like

576
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:53,758
they don't care
about any of that.

577
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,193
That is not a
consideration to them, no.

578
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,429
But here we sit, as a community,
arguing about edge cases.

579
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,997
Not getting together
to actually,

580
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,466
drastically change this
game, and we have got to.

581
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,369
I just wrote a blog,
to kind of tee this up,

582
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,538
and I said, you
know, we're hurdling

583
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,607
toward something as a community.

584
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,875
And I can't figure
out if that thing

585
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,543
is disaster or safety.

586
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,277
Like, to be honest with
you, some days I wake up

587
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,181
and I go, oh, this is the
day, like, we're doomed.

588
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,783
I'm also really trying
to stay optimistic

589
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,052
about the problem, because
we are making a dent.

590
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,155
There are good things
that are happening.

591
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,557
Our community has
got to get together

592
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,492
and demand that
we're actually gonna

593
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,226
be a community
around this stuff.

594
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,365
Spent some time
with Carl yesterday,

595
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,833
he said the same thing.

596
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,470
Yeah, we waste time and
companies are paying for it.

597
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:43,708
Like, cool, $300,
$400 an hour, awesome.

598
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,144
You just spent six
hours, find an SCCM.

599
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,879
It's not good, right.

600
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,615
So we all have these internal
sources of intelligence,

601
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,951
we have to treat it like
external threat intel.

602
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,825
Yeah, I'm a poker
player, and I've worked

603
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,527
a long time to actually go play

604
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,229
in the World Series if Poker.

605
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,597
What I can tell you about this,

606
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,566
is poker is very
interestingly, a whole lot

607
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,001
like incident response
and threat handling.

608
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,237
You have a constant
changing set of statistics.

609
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,139
Well, you have a baseline
set of statistics,

610
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,107
It changes per hand.

611
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:19,511
As an example, is that
player aggressive?

612
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,847
Have you seen hands
from him before?

613
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,050
Context in poker becomes
everything, as well,

614
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,886
because per hand
statistics change.

615
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:31,156
Aces aren't always the best
hand to play, trust me.

616
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,326
Normal and abnormal
gets really weird.

617
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,695
Is it normal for someone
to just go all in

618
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,096
when they pay $10,
000 on the first hand

619
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,864
in the World Series of Poker?

620
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,833
Yeah, I can tell you that
happens on a regular basis,

621
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,635
so it's not abnormal,
but I have to

622
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,470
factor that in to how I play.

623
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,740
To actually have a chance of
playing a hand and winning.

624
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,977
I think for us, we have
to do the same, okay.

625
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,982
Look, we can't choose
when the gaze of Sowron

626
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,417
comes upon our systems,
we can't choose

627
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,619
when evil's gonna hit us.

628
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,356
But we can choose what
to do once they're

629
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,624
inside our environments.

630
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,559
We can choose what to
do to set ourselves up

631
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,561
to be successful
when that does happen

632
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,062
and get through
those cycles faster.

633
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,964
That's what we can do first.

634
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,567
I can't control an adversary
when they're doing their thing.

635
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,469
Once they get on my network,
I can probably control 'em.

636
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,971
But we have no control over
them, what we can control

637
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,307
is who we are as a
community, and how we learn

638
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,242
and it's gotta change.

639
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,583
Knowing normal is everything.

640
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,986
We spend far too long
focused on finding evil,

641
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,555
we need to get through
the cycle faster.

642
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,524
We need to actually
act like a community.

643
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,496
We need massive
leaps in progress,

644
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,398
not linear changes.

645
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,402
I wanted to say thank you to
the entire Carbon Black team.

646
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,237
This was a true team effort.

647
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,372
I also wanted to thank
SANS, it was a goal of mine

648
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:59,077
to Keynote a SANS event for,
probably the last 15 years,

649
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,545
so thank you for
the opportunity,

650
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,047
and thank each and
every one of you

651
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,749
for being in the room,
and for doing what you do.

652
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,885
It's extremely
important, what we do.

653
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,587
And we don't get
told that enough,

654
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,523
so as a defender, as someone
who has wasted a lot of time

655
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,824
alongside all the rest
of us, I would just like

656
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,026
to personally thank you.

657
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,296
Keep up the good
fight, let's talk more,

658
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,165
let's get together
as a community.

659
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,600
We are Carbon Black, and
I am proud to (mumbles).

660
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,136
Thank you.

661
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:27,372
(applause)

662
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,778
