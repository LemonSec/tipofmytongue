1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:03,937
(drawn out technical sounds)

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:09,376
(applause)

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,777
- Let me give you
a little story.

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:12,912
I used to mountain bike,

5
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,114
before I started
running around the world

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,482
for Sans all the time,

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:18,183
and I basically was
up mountain biking

8
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,352
in the Frederick Watershed.

9
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,254
Frederick is,
Frederick, Maryland,

10
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,556
is the one that
I'm referring to.

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:27,227
Fort Detrick's there, Camp
David's a little north of there.

12
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,062
Amazing mountain bike trails.

13
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,231
So, we're up there,
mountain biking along,

14
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,565
my buddies and I were out there,

15
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:34,034
there were about
six or seven of us.

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,335
Myself and this one other guy,

17
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,604
we come into this clearing.

18
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,774
And my buddy stops,
and he looks over.

19
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,676
It's this area where
there's kind of a flat area.

20
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:45,011
The trail's going through it,

21
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,247
and then there's this pond.

22
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,784
And there is this amazing turkey

23
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,552
over on this other
side of the clearing.

24
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,355
And he's looking at that.

25
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,290
There's the big tom, and
there are two hens, too.

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,126
And we're looking at it,
and he's like, is that real?

27
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,327
I was like, I don't know,

28
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,296
that doesn't really
look real to me.

29
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:08,134
He's like, he's getting
his camera out of his bag,

30
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,036
and he's getting
off of his bike,

31
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,271
pulling his camera
off, 'cause you know,

32
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,639
like these turkeys
are gonna fly away,

33
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,907
and they're just not moving.

34
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,140
I'm just like, there's
something really weird

35
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,609
about what's going
on here, right?

36
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,244
So, he pulls his camera out,

37
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,479
and I'm standing there,

38
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,514
and this voice comes
out of the woods.

39
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:24,517
Hey, can't you see
I'm hunting here?

40
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,955
And I, because of
course, I'm not exactly

41
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,523
the smartest person
in the world.

42
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,058
I say, well, no,
I can't see you,

43
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,228
because you must be
wearing camouflage, right?

44
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,762
And as I'm saying this,

45
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,966
my other buddies are coming
up behind us on their bikes,

46
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:41,201
and one guy says to me,

47
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,402
hey, that guy has a gun.

48
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,339
You shouldn't be
yelling at him. (laughs)

49
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,707
Oh, right.

50
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,842
I get it, I get it.

51
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,510
So, in terms of hunting,

52
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,413
you actually need to be safe

53
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,714
in the way that you do it,

54
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,350
and if you set up a
great hunting trap,

55
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,652
and you set up your gun
pointed across a trail,

56
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,189
where a lot of people
are commonly walking,

57
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,958
that's actually gonna
ruin it for you.

58
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,494
And so you need to think about

59
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,562
how you're doing your hunting,

60
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,631
or you need to arrange
things in a way

61
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,634
so that your traps are
realistic for the attackers,

62
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,703
but, at the same time,
you're not trapping

63
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,707
the people who are
on your own team.

64
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,308
Rob actually talked
about this earlier,

65
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,612
where there were folks that
knew about the place to hit,

66
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,814
and they kept hitting it
over and over and over again,

67
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,483
and it spoiled the trap.

68
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,185
And this is the reality of it.

69
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,388
Another thing that I
want you to think about,

70
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,191
is you're coming into your
own environment to do hunting,

71
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,126
if you haven't been
doing it already.

72
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,730
That means that there is
possibly an adversary present

73
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,732
who is able to hunt you.

74
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,335
So, when you think
about hunting,

75
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,070
I want you to think
about being safe.

76
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,640
I want you to think about
doing things in a way

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,010
that is not going to put
the operations at risk.

78
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,612
And I'm gonna get to the
point of how to do all this.

79
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,281
But I also want you to
think about the fact

80
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,216
that yelling at the
person with the gun

81
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,585
isn't really a
smart thing to do.

82
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,587
And that analogy applies in

83
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:08,922
a lot of different
circumstances,

84
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,390
but for you in your environment,

85
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,226
when you're trying to
establish threat hunting,

86
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,528
these are the people
who are running systems.

87
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,796
These are the people
who are trying

88
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,298
to make your business work.

89
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,300
These are the people
who are there,

90
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,370
and set up, and are resource
constrained already.

91
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,208
And you're now trying
to add additional things

92
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,276
to make your job easier,

93
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,544
but at the same time,

94
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,113
you're creating
friction for them.

95
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,782
And you're creating a conflict

96
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,952
by adding additional things
into their environment.

97
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,522
So, everywhere possible
that you can hunt,

98
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,357
you should be thinking
about using what you

99
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,593
have at your disposal already,

100
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,994
and optimizing what you have
at your disposal already,

101
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,631
before you start to
add additional decoys.

102
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,766
Before you start to
add additional things

103
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,268
that they must do.

104
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,071
I also want to warn you

105
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,576
that you're going to
be implementing change,

106
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,811
and there are a lot of
things in our environment,

107
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,013
where when we change them,

108
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,082
we end up causing problems.

109
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,352
And I could have
grabbed any given quote,

110
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,387
but I love Despair,
Incorporated.

111
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,855
How many of you have
one of these posters

112
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,625
on your wall, or
have the coffee mug?

113
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,027
These are de-motivators.

114
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,429
It could be that the
purpose of your life

115
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,133
is only to serve as
a warning to others.

116
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,368
Okay?

117
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:32,138
The idea that what you
do is so wrong (laughs)

118
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,343
that is ends up being a
career limiting move for you.

119
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,478
And I really mean this.

120
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,246
You can do this in the things

121
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,748
that I'm going to
advocate for you to do.

122
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,251
You can cause so many
problems for your organization

123
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,320
that you will get
yourself fired.

124
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Sad, but true.

125
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,656
Just be careful.

126
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,427
I have extracted
a few tidbits out

127
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,096
of a five day
course that I wrote.

128
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,499
Jennifer and Rob contacted me

129
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,668
and basically said, hey,

130
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,337
we had somebody not
able to make it.

131
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,471
Can you do something,

132
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,140
talk about the security
operation stuff?

133
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,575
Yes, I love talking about that.

134
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,176
I love it so much
I wrote five days

135
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,612
worth of content on it.

136
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,316
So, these are just a few
little extracted things.

137
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,352
I think that most people
that present at this event

138
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,455
are going to tell you you need

139
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,626
to turn your hunting
into an operational task.

140
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,962
So my intention is
to try explain to you

141
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,332
how to make that happen.

142
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,467
How to lay the framework

143
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,803
so that you have an opportunity

144
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,172
to take the things that people

145
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,406
are doing with their hunting,

146
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,742
and turn then into
an operational task.

147
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,177
This is important.

148
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,545
This is necessary.

149
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,447
If you're not doing this,

150
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,849
then you're losing
out on resources

151
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,317
that you're developing.

152
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,654
In order to do this, you
need to have good structure.

153
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,456
You need to have
good discipline.

154
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,924
You need to have good practice.

155
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,993
So, I describe the
security operation center

156
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,262
in terms of functional areas,

157
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,565
and these are the
functional areas

158
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,601
that I use in order
to address this.

159
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,937
First off, there
is some structure

160
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,805
that is the steering committee.

161
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,974
And I don't care what
you call these things,

162
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,577
but all of these functions
need to be in place

163
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,414
in order to have good,
effective security operations.

164
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,183
Your steering committee
is intended to bridge

165
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,588
between the
technical operations,

166
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,990
both tactically
and strategically,

167
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,659
and the organization's progress.

168
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,597
If you do not have this,

169
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:39,698
the stock will be going one way,

170
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,801
the business will be
going another way.

171
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,070
The business will have
acquired somebody.

172
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,337
You don't know about it.

173
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,707
The business will have
strategic objectives.

174
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,575
You're not aligned with them.

175
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,577
And the steering committee
is intended to have

176
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,080
an ongoing, coordinating task.

177
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,384
Additionally, and someone asked
the question about metrics.

178
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,586
I'll try to talk about
that a little bit.

179
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,722
I'm not calling out
specific metrics in here.

180
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,357
But the steering
committee is who

181
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,692
the metrics would
be reported to.

182
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,028
And again, in 5-17, I
go into a lot of detail

183
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,231
about what metrics
should be presented,

184
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,733
but I think there
are some metrics

185
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,068
that should be presented
to the steering committee,

186
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,804
and one of the things was

187
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,205
the ability to sweep
the enterprise,

188
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,308
the time to sweep
the enterprise.

189
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,377
And what I mean by
sweep the enterprise

190
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,713
is to check the
environment, every node,

191
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,920
in order to assess if some
problem is present on that node.

192
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,789
And I kinda don't care if
that takes you two weeks,

193
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,659
but I want to have
it quantified.

194
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,861
Another capability is
the control center.

195
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,231
The control center is
the communication vehicle

196
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,766
for your security operations.

197
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,268
Requests come into
the control center,

198
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:53,506
information is disseminated
out of the control center.

199
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,143
This is your interrupt
receiving layer.

200
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,611
Those of you who
know Tom Limoncelli's

201
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,481
Time Management for
Systems Administrators.

202
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,615
If you haven't read that book,

203
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,449
you should read it.

204
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,051
It's a short book.

205
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,786
And one of the things
that he says is

206
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,721
that for all operations,

207
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,224
you must establish
an interrupt layer,

208
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,526
so the people who are
actually doing stuff,

209
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,161
the people who are
actually working,

210
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,662
don't get bothered,

211
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,631
and don't have to contact switch

212
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,299
out of the task that
they're performing.

213
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,469
You need to have network
security monitoring,

214
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,704
and in network
security monitoring,

215
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,539
I actually include
end point monitoring.

216
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,075
This is a nomenclature
that's out there,

217
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,210
but I think that network
security monitoring

218
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,447
is everything in your
information systems.

219
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,749
You need the threat
intelligence capability.

220
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:41,187
And this is both digestion of
external threat intelligence.

221
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,488
The purchasing of feeds,

222
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,657
or the collection of
open source information.

223
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:48,327
As well as the creation
of your own internal

224
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,563
threat intelligence and
tracking adversaries

225
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,564
who are attacking you.

226
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,767
You need a response function

227
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,603
that can run out and do things,

228
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,039
and I say that there are
basically three modes

229
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,707
that response
functions operate in,

230
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,242
and I don't wanna get
too far into this,

231
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,746
but the first mode is
janitorial services.

232
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,116
Janitorial services rolls
in with a mop bucket

233
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,484
after the problem has occurred,

234
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,553
and cleans up the mess.

235
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,656
Fire fighters who rush
out to a burning building,

236
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,991
and try to save lives,
and rescue animals,

237
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,326
and prevent the
spread of the fire

238
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,061
to other nearby buildings.

239
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,965
And eagles, the idea of
having an eye in the sky

240
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,067
that can take out
an adversary before

241
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,238
that adversary actually knows
that the defense is present.

242
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,141
I'd be happy to
elaborate on this more,

243
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,742
and those of you who
are in class this week

244
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,478
will hear me talk about this,

245
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:44,317
but your response
operates essentially
in those three modes,

246
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,919
and most of the
incident response

247
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,090
that I see in the world
today, is janitorial services.

248
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,092
People are even aspiring
to be firefighters,

249
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,861
but they're not there yet.

250
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,164
Forensic capability
is important.

251
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,766
Forensic capability
answers deep questions.

252
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,604
Specific questions about what's

253
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,839
happening in the environment.

254
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,041
And then finally the
notion of self-assessment,

255
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,111
and this includes
configuration monitoring.

256
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,013
This includes change control.

257
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,616
This includes
vulnerability scanning.

258
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,650
This includes pen testing.

259
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,486
This includes red teaming.

260
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,887
All of these things
are necessary

261
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,723
in order to do
security operations.

262
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,891
And the question is, well,

263
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,394
where do we put hunting?

264
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,229
And my answer is everywhere.

265
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,932
Every single facet of
your security operations

266
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,401
can be doing hunting
in their own way.

267
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,838
And if you have a
dedicated hunt team,

268
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,305
that's great.

269
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,808
That dedicated hunt team
probably sit somewhere

270
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,745
in between never security
monitoring threat intelligence,

271
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,947
and incident response.

272
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,383
But I think that
each of these areas

273
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,218
should have as a task,

274
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:55,488
the responsibility to
express threat hunting.

275
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,257
This is as much
a cultural aspect

276
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,959
of your security operations

277
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,993
as it is a specific task.

278
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,367
This is my basic
diagram in terms of

279
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,771
what security
operations looks like,

280
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,205
and I know that you
can't see it. (laughs)

281
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,574
I know that you
can't understand it.

282
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,943
This is a swim lane
diagram depicting

283
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:22,081
the enumerated processes
for the functional areas

284
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,050
that I've described.

285
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,017
And this is just the processes.

286
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,954
When I actually talk
about developing this,

287
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,558
I identify five elements
for every process.

288
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,828
The input to the process,

289
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:38,329
the people tasked
with performing this.

290
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,200
The process itself,
the technology required

291
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,903
to accomplish this
process, and the artifacts,

292
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,872
or the outputs associated
with that process.

293
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,376
If you and your organization
cannot articulate all

294
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,112
of the relationships
between all of the people

295
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,581
that are doing things,
you have a serious problem

296
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,283
in your security operations.

297
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,753
This is a basic, I
think, basic expression

298
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,521
of security operations.

299
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,957
If you want to download this,

300
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,728
I have a Bitly link at the end.

301
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,630
I'll throw this diagram
in there as well.

302
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,799
I might have a TIFF, a
JPEG, and a Vizio version

303
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,668
of this that I'm happy to share.

304
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,104
This is basic,
fundamental expression.

305
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,107
If you do not have
this, start here.

306
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:25,010
Get with the people
that you work with.

307
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,746
I don't care if there
are two more of you

308
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,914
or it's you yourself, alright?

309
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,084
or if you have a thousand
people across your organization

310
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,152
that are working your
security operations.

311
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:38,324
Identify the relationships
and the flow of information,

312
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,260
and who does it,
what they're doing,

313
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,962
what technology they use,

314
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,930
and the output from
each of those processes,

315
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,298
and then it's really
quite straightforward

316
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,701
to say, okay, you,
this functional area,

317
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,971
you're going to incorporate
this hunting task,

318
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,742
and this is where we're
actually going to perform it.

319
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,846
Additionally, you must train
people in what hunting is.

320
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,585
And I thought about
how I define hunting,

321
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,521
and my explanation was knowing

322
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,157
and applying the
way, the weather,

323
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,126
the terrain, leadership,
and discipline.

324
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,127
And so those of
you keeping track

325
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,397
for your slides to Sun Tzu,

326
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,033
This is it.

327
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,002
We finally made it
to the Sun Tzu quote.

328
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,236
What is the way?

329
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,338
Well, the way is
all of the things

330
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,574
that we know in terms of
the information systems

331
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,076
that we're operating in.

332
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,513
And the notion of how
adversaries behave.

333
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,982
What is the weather?

334
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,185
Weather's interesting,

335
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,420
in terms of cyber security,

336
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,658
information assurance,
whatever term you wanna use.

337
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,395
Weather is stuff like when
the Mirai botnet ramps up

338
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,797
and starts hitting
a particular place.

339
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,499
You know what else
is the weather?

340
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,667
Patch Tuesday.

341
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,135
Why?

342
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,670
Cause Patch Tuesday constantly
changes the environment,

343
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,573
and it's cyclical.

344
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:01,439
It's cyclical.

345
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,374
This comes through.

346
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,976
This affects the adversary.

347
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,846
This also affects the defense.

348
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,347
What is the terrain?

349
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,115
The terrain is both
the topology of

350
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,183
the information systems that

351
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,552
you're tasked with protecting.

352
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,822
And all of the defensive
layer that you have in place.

353
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,390
You must know this.

354
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,961
If do not know this,

355
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,829
it's very difficult to hunt.

356
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,497
If you do know it then
it's easy to hunt,

357
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,234
because it's predictable, right?

358
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,037
The lanes of travel for the
adversary are predictable.

359
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,606
What is leadership?

360
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,576
Leadership is ability
for one person,

361
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,947
or a group of people,

362
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:45,317
to act in accordance
with one another.

363
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,889
My sort of prototypical
structure of leadership is

364
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,357
for every 10 people,

365
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:55,526
there's one person who's
responsible for disseminating

366
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,730
strategic and tactical view,

367
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,266
as well as aggregating
information

368
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,271
from those other nine
people, and passing it up.

369
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,805
Very straightforward.

370
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,973
This also is cultural.

371
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,743
If everybody on your team knows

372
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,578
that part of what they do

373
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,548
is to help to drive
a concerted effort.

374
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,883
Leadership's easy,

375
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,486
and this also blends
into discipline.

376
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:24,056
If I tell somebody in the
midst of incident response,

377
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,491
don't touch that,

378
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,861
and they're going to
start arguing with me.

379
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,496
There's probably
not good discipline.

380
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,864
If I know that I'm in charge,

381
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,032
and that person knows that I'm

382
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,700
in charge of an
instant response task,

383
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,436
and I say leave that alone.

384
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,772
Don't take that system down.

385
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,407
If I express that,

386
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,611
and the person noticed
that I'm serious,

387
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,578
and actually does it,

388
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,646
that's good discipline.

389
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,249
If you start to get into

390
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,118
the notions of
targeted intrusions

391
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,853
versus non-target intrusions,

392
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:58,122
which I think is an
incredibly tough thing

393
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,225
to accomplish for
most organizations,

394
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,194
'cause how do you differentiate
which is targeted,

395
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,762
and which isn't.

396
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,866
Usually it requires an
abundance of threat intelligence

397
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:11,670
and really rapid decisions
about being able to say,

398
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,473
here's what we know, let's
do this instead of that,

399
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,043
let's not take the system
down that's monitoring.

400
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,845
The idea with this is
that you're in a place

401
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,181
where you can actually do
things like watch and learn.

402
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,716
If you're going to
do watch and learn,

403
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,286
you need to have
really good discipline,

404
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:31,457
You need to have procedures
that you can execute flawlessly.

405
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,729
As well as have the ability
to improvise in a way

406
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,933
that causes minimal
damage discipline.

407
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,534
So my idea of what
thread hunting

408
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,470
looks like is for
every staff member,

409
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,807
they do two hours per
week of threat hunting.

410
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:52,077
This is structured
in the sense that we

411
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,680
have allocated time,

412
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,449
we have specific artifacts

413
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,050
that we want as output,

414
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,686
but we do not necessarily have

415
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,622
a specific process of
what they do in terms

416
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,190
of follow these steps,

417
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,026
it's more a general concept

418
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,694
of here's how you
approach the problem

419
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,796
and here's what I
want out of you.

420
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,297
I want detections.

421
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,733
Part of your hunting is I
want you to detect problems

422
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,467
that are in my environment.

423
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,569
That's an artifact.

424
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,471
We found something bad.

425
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,642
Additionally, I want you to
describe your method for hunting

426
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:28,312
because if you happen
to detect something

427
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,749
and you can go back and
express your methodology

428
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,184
of how you accomplish that,

429
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,219
that means that everybody
else can now employ

430
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,388
that same methodology.

431
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,622
I want scripts.

432
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,960
I want a script out of you.

433
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,030
For two hours of time
in the any given week,

434
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,733
I want you to either build
a new script or enhance

435
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,134
the script that exists,

436
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,170
or I want you to be developing

437
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,072
your capability to do scripting.

438
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,373
Two hours a week
goes a long way.

439
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,677
I want rules for
detection systems.

440
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,413
I want as an output,
a specific rule,

441
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,648
and you know what?

442
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,315
The first time most your
team members do this,

443
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,784
it's going to be
a terrible rule,

444
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,086
and it's going to have
loads of false positives,

445
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,320
but who cares?

446
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,721
Because if this is
a known artifact

447
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,258
from a hunt action,
from a hunt process,

448
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,561
I can take that apply it.

449
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:18,563
And finally I want use cases,

450
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,567
and use cases are
scenarios describing

451
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,002
the terrain of our environment,

452
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,538
and how an adversary
will actually attack it.

453
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,774
And then use cases
can be folded into any

454
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,508
of our analytical platforms,

455
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,679
in order to be able
to operationalize,

456
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,316
if you'll forgive the non-word,

457
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,785
operationalize the hunt.

458
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,621
And this what we
really want to get to.

459
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
Scripts are great
for this, initially,

460
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,693
but use cases are really
what make it good.

461
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,395
And so, as an example,

462
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,732
in a description of
the idea of hunting,

463
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,270
I have a picture of some sort

464
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,174
of central analytical platform,

465
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,242
and I'm calling it a SIM,

466
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,476
and that's a good way.

467
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,844
This might be a a log
correlation engine,

468
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,179
it might be any
technology that you employ

469
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,413
in order to do this,

470
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:11,717
but I have lots of
data fed into this.

471
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,385
And if you notice in

472
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,921
the upper right hand
corner of this slide,

473
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,992
I have this historical
assessment with new IOC's.

474
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,328
And the idea is, as I'm going

475
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:27,466
and doing my aggregation
ongoing assessment,

476
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,868
every once in awhile,

477
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:34,039
I take the opportunity to
go back with the new things

478
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,777
that I've learned, and
reassess the information

479
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,979
that I have available to me,

480
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,148
in order to determine
if something

481
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,050
that we found out is a problem,

482
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,086
either internally or from
the open-source collection,

483
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,422
or from the threat
feed that we're buying,

484
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:51,857
or from some pew pew map

485
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,626
of here's some bad IP addresses,

486
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:57,629
I go back and look
for that stuff.

487
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,098
I go back and look
for techniques

488
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,868
that are released
on some dump site

489
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,604
where someone says, hey,
this is a nation-state actor,

490
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,606
we broke into that
nation state actor

491
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,342
and discovered their techniques

492
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,211
and now we're putting
that stuff out there,

493
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
and this is a PT-1 and
this is Shadow Brokers

494
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,416
and this is all the reports
that we take and digest.

495
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,485
We go back historically
and do an assessment.

496
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,654
This also is hunting.

497
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,757
This also was a
technique of developing

498
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,492
an awareness of our environment,

499
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:31,430
looking at the components
of data that we have.

500
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,266
So how do we do this?

501
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,568
Well, there are a
couple of things.

502
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,172
First of all, we pick
some IOC or some TTP,

503
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,074
and express the
notion of what it is

504
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,243
that we're actually doing,

505
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,616
and then we go back to our
data and look for that,

506
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,551
and we have to build
the capability,

507
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,720
and again, we might
be buying this from

508
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,955
a vendor in order to do it.

509
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,957
How frequently do
we run this task?

510
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,629
My assertion is at the half-life

511
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,365
of the data that
you have stored.

512
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,934
So as an example,

513
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,303
if you have 30
days of full PCAP,

514
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,308
I want you running
this every two weeks.

515
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:19,111
And this isn't
just to full PCAP,

516
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,079
but this is a great
place to apply it

517
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,348
if you actually have that.

518
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,119
You could do this in DNS logs,

519
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,721
you could do this
in host face logs,

520
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,491
but anytime you come up
with a new indicator,

521
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,760
you run it against
the store data.

522
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,064
At the half-life of
the data's persistence.

523
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,968
So if you can only
keep logs for 3 days,

524
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,937
because of some
management restriction

525
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,173
or because of some
technical restriction,

526
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:51,410
every day you
should be running on

527
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,180
the last 3 days of
data that you have.

528
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,283
Couple of other
examples of this.

529
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,852
Another historical assessment
that I quite like is

530
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,257
the idea of looking
at all of the hosts

531
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,394
that have been requested
by DNS in your environment.

532
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,463
So all of your users, every day,

533
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,197
are requesting hosts.

534
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,104
However, adversary
technique is typically to,

535
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:21,907
at least on an initial entry,

536
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,676
to end up using
new domain names.

537
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:28,580
You can actually
track this over time.

538
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,449
Of all the hosts that
everybody has ever gone to,

539
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,685
and then everyday,
on a daily basis,

540
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,154
look at your logs, see
anything that was new in

541
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:37,589
the previous day.

542
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,225
What did you just do?

543
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,293
You just took unstructured data,

544
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,230
and found a bunch of leaves
that your staff can go

545
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,998
and start to investigate.

546
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,333
What does this look at?

547
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,802
It looks at a specific
adversary technique.

548
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:54,606
The adversary technique
of generating new domains.

549
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,274
And so, people will
come up with all sorts

550
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,344
of fancy domain generation
algorithm decoding.

551
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,848
But, at the same time,

552
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,683
the same time, you can just say,

553
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,318
well what is the characteristic

554
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,286
of what the adversary's doing?

555
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,988
They're coming up
with new stuff.

556
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,057
And if I can just
look for new things,

557
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,126
then I can go and investigate.

558
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,062
Likewise, all of your
Mauer detonation devices,

559
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,734
lots of different capability,
technical capability out there

560
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,905
that pulls executables off of
the network, or off of emails.

561
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,810
You should be storing that

562
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,646
executable for a long time.

563
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:37,048
It doesn't take
up a ton of space.

564
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,217
And every interval,

565
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,619
however long you can store it,

566
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,254
whatever the
half-life is for that,

567
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,425
every interval go back and
apply your updated antivirus.

568
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,596
Your updated tools
against the executables,

569
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,864
and see what's there.

570
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,933
As an example,
there was a new tool

571
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:59,271
that was announced
last year, thereabouts.

572
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,338
It's called FLOSS.

573
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,840
Anyone hear about FLOSS?

574
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,943
Alright, FLOSS is kind of
like Strings plus plus.

575
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,245
What FLOSS does is it looks at

576
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:10,014
an executable for loops,

577
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,484
which are doing decoding.

578
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,721
and then FLOSS takes
the executable itself,

579
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,591
and feeds it back
into a recreation

580
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,659
of any iterative loop inside

581
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,894
of the executable,

582
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,229
in order to determine if

583
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:27,532
that executable is
decoding itself.

584
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,768
Because an adversary
technique is

585
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:33,338
to apply encoding in
order to hide from us.

586
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,309
New tool comes out later,

587
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,513
and now we're able
to take our samples

588
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,014
from the last couple
of weeks, years,

589
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,817
however long you've
been collecting.

590
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,487
Decades, in some people's cases.

591
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,356
And go back and apply
this new analytical

592
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,458
technique to old samples.

593
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,662
Don't throw this stuff away.

594
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,167
Know that you can store
important artifacts,

595
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,937
and assess them historically.

596
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,108
So this is what I
think about when

597
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,744
I think about hunting.

598
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:17,215
An example of a hunt
is historical analysis.

599
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,118
So I think that
hunting is not new.

600
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,388
Rob mentioned this.

601
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:27,425
We've been doing this for
a massive amount of time.

602
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,961
Not just in
information security,

603
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,864
but for the existence of people.

604
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
We hunt.

605
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,866
This is what we do.

606
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,636
This is how we
call resources from

607
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,806
the environment that
we're attacking.

608
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:42,641
I'm sorry.

609
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:45,176
That we're defending.

610
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,678
That we're defending.

611
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:49,347
We know that people
are attacking it,

612
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,583
and we're looking for that,

613
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,154
our security operations requires

614
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,991
incredibly complex
interchange of information.

615
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:05,830
We must establish a
clearly articulated view

616
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,500
of how we are doing this.

617
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,003
If we cannot articulate
how we're working.

618
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,774
We have to do that first,

619
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,144
because the opportunity for us

620
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:22,847
to assist our
organization relies on

621
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:26,618
our ability to actually say
what we can and cannot do.

622
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,919
And then, we are working

623
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,424
for improvement
in the long term,

624
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,126
and then I want you to
think about carefully

625
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,129
mixing hunting into
your operations.

626
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,667
Select specific things.

627
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,703
Change the culture
of your environment,

628
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,472
so that this is just
an additional task

629
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,374
of what everybody does.

630
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,976
And not everybody's
going to have

631
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:55,880
a great idea every single time
they set out to do hunting.

632
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,517
But what's going
happen is, over time,

633
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,886
with the practice of hunting,

634
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,523
somebody, one day, is going
to come up with something

635
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,859
that's really quite valuable.

636
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,860
And that valuable
thing will allow for

637
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,163
the application across
a lot of other people

638
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,566
to perform that hunting
technique as well as

639
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,701
for you to go back
historically and look

640
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,236
at your environment in order

641
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:22,374
to understand what exactly
has happened in the past.

642
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:23,642
Because if you detect it,

643
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,510
even if it's a
year or two later,

644
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,812
at least you
eventually detected it.

645
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,049
And as you change your
behavior over time,

646
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,884
you will eventually
get faster at that.

647
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:36,154
(intense instrumental)
