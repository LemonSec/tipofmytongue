1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,169
(electronic music)

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,045
(audience applause)

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,280
- So Rob, thank you very
much for that introduction,

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,116
but I will note
that it was Phil,

5
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,084
you were taking long walks
in the moonlight with

6
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,519
last night, and not me.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,753
(crowd laughing)

8
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,990
So I know where I sit
in the priority ranking.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,991
Good morning everybody.

10
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,329
And thank you for your
time this morning.

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,265
Rob went over my
background, but here it is

12
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,633
with the dates and the numbers.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,637
I've been really lucky,
I've had a great career.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,640
I came out of college
and into the Air Force

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,843
right as information security
really started to ramp up.

16
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:46,746
The Air Force is probably
10, maybe 15 years ahead

17
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,649
of general commercial industry,

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,251
since they've been
getting targeted by

19
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,021
the targeted attackers
for a number of years.

20
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,991
So we cut our teeth
there, all of us.

21
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,593
There's a number of us ex
Air Force guys from that era

22
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:05,165
who cut our teeth in information
security in that business.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,167
Then I got to go to
D.C. and do all of that

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,735
spooky offensive computer stuff,

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,370
which is a whole lot of
fun, and it really helped me

26
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,672
appreciate the realities of
the kinds of capabilities

27
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,774
that are, attackers have.

28
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,412
As well as the, how flawed
your assumptions may be

29
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,148
in what you think is secure.

30
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:24,149
And then of course,
life came in,

31
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,386
I got married, moved
away from D.C.,

32
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,054
was in the midst of
trying to figure out

33
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,722
what I'm going to
do with my life.

34
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,357
Professionally, at least.

35
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,595
Mike and Ben called and said
hey we got this little thing

36
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,932
going, this Carbon
Black, maybe you want

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,500
to come help us with it.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,435
And of course, it's
been a wild ride since.

39
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,703
It's been fantastic.

40
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:47,006
So, like I said
I'm really lucky.

41
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,976
Since this has been my career,

42
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,545
and people would call me
a subject matter expert.

43
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:56,850
And that's been very useful
and beneficial today,

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,018
because holy cow,
this is a crazy time

45
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,023
to be in information security.

46
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:08,193
It is so noisy out there,
with us trying to figure out

47
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:11,264
how we're going to
evolve from this

48
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,666
position of static protections,

49
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,202
where we deploy McAfee
and forget about it,

50
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:20,773
to this operational program,
with continuous procedures,

51
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,509
of protection,
detection, and response

52
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,810
as an operational thing
throughout the enterprise.

53
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,715
And since those work
flows are new and evolving

54
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,650
there's a lot of spending now,

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,785
there's a lot of
markets and vendors out.

56
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,756
And we all are doing business
slightly differently,

57
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,559
as a community we're
all coming together

58
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,730
to try to understand
and establish which
procedure's work,

59
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,965
which are best, have the best
practices rise to the top,

60
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:48,701
and then start building
tools before that.

61
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,503
Except vendors are
out in front of us,

62
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,971
so they're at the table as well.

63
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,941
I'm a vendor too.

64
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,810
Also trying to provide
products that assume

65
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,814
a certain workflow,
and everybody's got
a different opinion.

66
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,983
But those vendors are
marketing organizations,

67
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,219
they got big bullhorns,
they're loud.

68
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,388
And it can make it very
very confusing and chaotic

69
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,025
and hard to tease apart.

70
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,327
It's challenging for me,
and I'm a subject matter

71
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,995
expert in the field.

72
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,833
And I can't imagine
how difficult it is

73
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,470
for those of you who are
newer to this business.

74
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,472
It's enough for all the
confusion to make it

75
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,008
even a little depressing.

76
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,946
I mean trust me, and I've
had my cycles over the years.

77
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,249
For me, my crucible
story, not crucible story,

78
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,483
not crucible story.

79
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,952
My defining moment
and my origin story

80
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,554
for Carbon Black goes back
to the Air Force days.

81
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,957
When the, let's see, those
of you military guys,

82
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,760
the senior civilian in charge
of the Air Force CITS Program,

83
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,929
which buys all the I.T.
stuff for all the Air Force,

84
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,765
nationwide, worldwide.

85
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,768
I gave him a big scary
brief on the insecurity

86
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,070
of his networks.

87
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,571
And he thumped me in
the chest and said,

88
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,806
I believe you son.

89
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,040
I've got 50 million
dollars to spend

90
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,809
next year in Air Force
I.T. infrastructure,

91
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,545
and security is
priority number one.

92
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:08,147
You tell me what to
buy, and we'll buy it.

93
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,483
And we took that seriously.

94
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,518
We want back and
researched all the things

95
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,354
that were available from
the various vendors,

96
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,389
but this was 2002.

97
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,825
We barely have those products
available for us today,

98
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,726
much less 15 years ago.

99
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,832
Since then, I have been waiting
for industry to catch up.

100
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,202
And for the commercial
market to catch up,

101
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,304
and for solutions
to be available.

102
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,606
And it's been very frustrating.

103
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,442
And with all the confusion
in the market today,

104
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,777
that's like a glimmer of hope,

105
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,679
but it's still a
lot of frustration.

106
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:43,082
But I realized, as I
kinda reflected upon

107
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,852
myself and my career
and our industry

108
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,953
in preparation for this talk,

109
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,590
that somewhere in
the last year or so

110
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,659
I have become optimistic.

111
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,996
And, there's of
course a lot of things

112
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,498
that go into that.

113
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,401
But as I tried to
kind of tease out and

114
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:05,905
figure out the thing that
was making me optimistic,

115
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,407
I settled on this.

116
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,011
This was a paper
written in 1995,

117
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,113
back when the internet
was still a baby,

118
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,682
by a pair of economists from the

119
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,383
University of Tennessee.

120
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,519
A Human Capital Perspective
on Criminal Careers,

121
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,889
they were studying why
criminals are encouraged

122
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,524
to do crime.

123
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,793
Why do they choose
to break the law

124
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,961
instead of being a
law abiding citizen?

125
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,197
And it's a simple
cost benefit equation.

126
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,132
They included this
equation in their paper

127
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,535
in order to help model
and kind of codify

128
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,503
the elements that they
saw as the most salient.

129
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,639
Over on the left,
it's the benefits.

130
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,342
You've got the direct monetary
benefits of committing

131
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,878
the crime in 1995, that
would be the cash, drugs,

132
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,815
VCR's or rear projection TV's,

133
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,151
you might be able to
get from committing

134
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,219
some kind of crime.

135
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,054
You got the
psychological benefits,

136
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,357
say the street cred
that you would get

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,160
from your buds for
breaking in to somewhere.

138
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,464
Over on the right side
you've got the costs

139
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,665
of committing the crime.

140
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,800
It's first the opportunity cost,

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,836
how much it's going to take you,

142
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,739
your time, whatever
resources you have to outlay\

143
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,607
in order to commit that crime,

144
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,009
plus the prosecution cost.

145
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,379
What's your lost
wages going to be

146
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,614
if your incarcerated
for x number of years,

147
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:26,551
times the probability of
apprehension and conviction.

148
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,955
Note they're independent
and separate elements,

149
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,224
because those two are
independent and separate things

150
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,259
both with their
own probabilities.

151
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,895
And if you apply this to
the digital world today

152
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,996
and cyber crime, it's
pretty fantastic.

153
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,467
The monetary benefit
has shifted from

154
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:45,772
VCR's and rear projection
TV's to credit cards,

155
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:48,074
personally identifiable
information,

156
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,809
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

157
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,813
The psychological benefit,
back in the late 90's

158
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,784
when this was first
developed, it was maybe the

159
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,919
street cred was
defacing websites,

160
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,990
when was the last time
you saw a website defaced.

161
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,427
These days it's more like
stolen Twitter feeds,

162
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,831
or maybe leaking the
celebrity nude photos.

163
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,534
But you could also expand
that to include, say,

164
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,570
the hacktivists and
the folks that have

165
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,972
politically charged leanings.

166
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,075
All the stuff coming
out on WikiLeaks,

167
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:28,181
for example the Anonymous,
for example maybe even

168
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:34,086
influencing the election
process in another country.

169
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,456
Over on the right hand
side with the costs,

170
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,458
this is where it
really gets incredible.

171
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,626
Because the opportunity
costs is roughly the same,

172
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,727
the number of resources
or time you have to outlay

173
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,963
in order to commit the crime,

174
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,966
but take a look at the
cost of prosecution,

175
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,337
and the probability of
apprehension and of conviction.

176
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,639
Y'all know as well as I
that those probabilities

177
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,975
on the internet today
is basically zero.

178
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,879
And that takes that whole
element down to zero.

179
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,849
So when you weigh the
cost benefit analysis,

180
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,418
the only reason someone
hasn't compromised

181
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,589
a given network is because it
hasn't been worth their time.

182
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,995
Now as sobering as
that data point is,

183
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,800
this still makes me optimistic.

184
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,237
It makes me optimistic
because it makes very clear

185
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,107
that we don't have to
eliminate the probability

186
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,343
of someone compromising
our networks,

187
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,411
we don't have to make
it impossible to do.

188
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,113
All we have to do is make
this cost benefit equation

189
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,582
balance out.

190
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,085
For you, on your network,
with the data you have

191
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:43,823
that an attacker can convert
into some kind of benefit,

192
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,223
whether it be direct
monetary benefit

193
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,326
or psychological benefit,
all you have to do

194
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,229
is increase his cost
of executing that crime

195
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:54,500
to a point where it
no longer makes sense.

196
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,503
We don't have to fix
information security.

197
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,438
We don't have to
make it go away,

198
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,473
we just have to
manage that problem.

199
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,610
Now this distinction
between fixing and managing,

200
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,548
this is one I remind
myself of all the time.

201
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,283
See, I'm and engineer, right?

202
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,118
That's my training,
I'm a technical guy.

203
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,587
My job is to fix problems,
I make them go away.

204
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,257
But some things in life,
you can't fix them,

205
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,394
you can't make them go away.

206
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:26,098
All you can do is manage
them carefully over time.

207
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:28,968
About probably two or
three times a year,

208
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,536
I go pull up this and read it.

209
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,740
This was published
to the web in 1994 by

210
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,611
John something or other,
I forget his last name,

211
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,045
he was the founder of Autodesk,

212
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,081
most well know for AutoCAD.

213
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,384
He was probably five years
in to the start of life,

214
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,221
of AutoCAD, or Autodesk, and
started having weight problems.

215
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:52,058
I can certainly appreciate
five years into a

216
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,627
start up life and
starting to struggle.

217
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,396
So him, being an engineer
and a technical guy,

218
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:01,133
he took the empirical,
analytical engineering approach

219
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,235
to understanding weight loss.

220
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,671
And he studied it as a topic.

221
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,343
And one of the
insights from there

222
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,646
is that your weight is
not something you can fix,

223
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,046
it can only be managed.

224
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,850
Now, many of you might
say, well duh of course,

225
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,318
right, that's obvious.

226
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,353
But it's human nature
to think otherwise.

227
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,955
It's obvious every time
you go to the checkout line

228
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,291
of a grocery store, Men's
Health, Cosmopolitan,

229
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,294
they've all got the headline
with the one secret you need,

230
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,831
let's see this time of year
it's the secret to getting

231
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,866
that beach body, ooo.

232
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,169
Always promising the secret
magic silver bullet you need

233
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,905
in order to lose weight fast.

234
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,308
And that's never
going to happen.

235
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:46,145
You know that, intellectually,
but there's always the hope

236
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,547
that you can find that
magic silver bullet.

237
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,651
In this paper he uses
the example of the

238
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,121
Bell Telephone System in order
to illustrate this point.

239
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:59,425
The Bell System back
in, he starts with 1902,

240
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,628
had a ratio of engineers,
of operators to phones,

241
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,600
it was one operator
for every 47 phones.

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,169
Now at the time there
were, I don't know,

243
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,005
a million phones or
something out in the world.

244
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,908
So that required a
relatively large organization

245
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,443
of 30,000 telephone operators
in order to operate that.

246
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,179
Now remember, this
is 1902, right,

247
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,415
so there's a telephone
switchboard right here

248
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,016
that's like the
direct lines coming in

249
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,520
from all your phones, and
then there is an operator

250
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,488
that is doing the
manual cross connect

251
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,892
from your line to whoever
your caller line is

252
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:37,863
in order to connect that
together at the switchboard.

253
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,666
And that was sustainable
there for 1902

254
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:44,070
with that kinda, with that
scale and class of a problem.

255
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,938
30,000 people is a
large organization,

256
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,439
but it's a manageable size.

257
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,477
You probably come from
companies that are larger.

258
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,480
But, the Bell
executives had a vision.

259
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,849
They knew that the telephone
was this revolutionary device,

260
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,784
that was going to catch
on, it was going to be in

261
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,553
every home, in every
business, on every desk,

262
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,922
and they foresaw a world
with millions and millions

263
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,157
and millions of telephones.

264
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,895
And with a ratio of operators
to phones of one to 47,

265
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,831
it was going to take
an organization of

266
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,235
three million operators
in order to sustain that,

267
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,037
clearly impracticable.

268
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,440
So, they went to the engineers,
and said hey guys, right.

269
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,975
Can you like, automate
this phone switch

270
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,410
so we take the human out?

271
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,545
And the engineer said,
yeah we sure can,

272
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,615
we can totally
automate that, 100%.

273
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,117
But it's going to take decades,

274
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,053
and millions and millions
and millions of dollars.

275
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,590
Clearly impractical
to do very quickly.

276
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,392
But of course that
team got together,

277
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,828
the managers and the engineers.

278
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,664
Managers who build organizations
with people and processes

279
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:49,735
to repeatedly solve problems
in a scalable, tractable,

280
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,137
and repeatable manner.

281
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,037
Engineers, who apply technology
and incremental fixes

282
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,573
to improve efficiency.

283
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:57,042
And the engineers came up
with a series of small,

284
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,944
practical, reasonable
engineering improvements

285
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,846
to make that operator's
life more efficient.

286
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,215
They implemented those
over a period of time

287
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:07,386
and by the 80's they'd gotten
that ratio down 20 fold,

288
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,890
which seems relatively small,

289
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,260
but it was enough that
with however many,

290
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,562
100 million phones
that were in existence,

291
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,598
by the 1980's that it only
required an organization

292
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,568
of 160,000 operators
in order to maintain.

293
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,704
Still, a tractable problem
for the managers to manage

294
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,540
in an organization.

295
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,509
And then today, here
we are another 30,

296
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,812
almost 40 years later,
and when was the last time

297
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,347
you talked to an operator
to complete a call.

298
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,550
And finally, 100 years
later, 80 years later,

299
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,486
they have fully
automated that system.

300
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,056
But in order to
solve that problem,

301
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,991
it took a combination
of management,

302
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,127
people, and processes, and
technology from the engineers.

303
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:53,566
And the solution for fixing
the problem straight up front

304
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,367
was not required.

305
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,870
Fixing, managing, and solving.

306
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,740
Three very distinctly
and different things.

307
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,043
Now, if I'd ask you
all five minutes ago

308
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,045
the difference between
those three things,

309
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,413
many of you probably
would have said,

310
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,648
eh, they're the same, right.

311
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,850
And hopefully now
you'll appreciate

312
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,352
the nuance and the difference.

313
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,789
As you scale this up and
talk to the business guys

314
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,859
who don't understand all
this computer security stuff,

315
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,295
you consider managing
problems like this.

316
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,733
It's pretty normal.

317
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,370
They deal with this kind
of stuff all the time.

318
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,541
I was having a conversation
with a CISO of a major

319
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:40,646
financial multi national
conglomerate firm,

320
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:44,083
huge huge firm, interests in a
whole lot of different fields

321
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,387
and he remarked that his
board that he reports to

322
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,458
quarterly or whatever,
they have a corporate risk

323
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,161
register where they keep
track of all the risks

324
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,530
to the corporation.

325
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,033
It's required by SEC
guidelines to report at least

326
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,168
a subset of those in
your annual filings.

327
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,671
And that they rack
and stack those risks

328
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,208
to the corporation by overall
magnitude of that risk.

329
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,377
And for him, in
his organization,

330
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,813
information security
was number one.

331
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,814
Holy cow, that's insane.

332
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,086
This is a firm
that is subject to

333
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,857
all these major geopolitical
risks and issues.

334
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,961
Currency fluctuation,
the price of oil, Brexit,

335
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,697
the stability in
the Middle East,

336
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,234
all sorts of these
major political issues

337
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,836
they have zero control
over as a corporation.

338
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,072
Zero influence, zero
ability to manage.

339
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,708
And yet, information
security of their devices

340
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,977
on their networks
that they 100% control

341
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,713
is still the number
one top risk.

342
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,219
As a security guy,
that pisses me off.

343
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:55,988
It makes me disappointed,
and honestly,

344
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,724
a little ashamed
and embarrassed.

345
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,329
Everyone of these
corporations, his corporation,

346
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,299
as well as all of ours, manage
risks on a day to day basis.

347
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,233
And many of those are
risks we don't control.

348
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:13,539
Retail has got shrinkage, the
financial firm has got fraud,

349
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,708
every corporation in America is

350
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,675
subject to terminal liability.

351
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,878
A pregnant woman could
walk into the lobby

352
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,548
of any one of our buildings,
slip on a wet floor,

353
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:26,518
crack her head, kill
herself and the baby.

354
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,554
A tragic, tragic, event.

355
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,956
Unpredictable. Unpreventable.

356
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,159
In any one of those
situations the corporation

357
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,328
will be held liable or found
liable or found negligent

358
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,098
in some way because maybe the
janitor didn't get out there

359
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,366
to put the wet floor sign out,

360
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,900
or maybe the carpet was frayed,

361
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,403
or, or, or, or, or, you've
seen these things unfold.

362
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,839
And yet, add as a corporation,

363
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,408
they have zero control over it.

364
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,481
But, for all of those risks
across all of the industries

365
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,182
that our corporations
are subject to,

366
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,184
they've managed to find
the right balance of

367
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,788
operational risk mitigation's,
risk transference

368
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,290
through insurance,
and just straight up

369
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,760
risk acceptance of the
remaining residual risk

370
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,596
to a point where it's
business as usual.

371
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,297
It's not a major
crisis for the board,

372
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,600
managing the liability
programs of their corporation

373
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,534
and their physical facilities.

374
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,604
It's not a major of
the thing to manage

375
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,774
shrinkage or fraud,
or, or, or, or, or.

376
00:17:21,773 --> 00:17:23,841
There's certainly things
that have to be managed

377
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,644
inside the organization,
and there's metrics,

378
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,279
and there's reporting
and there's investments

379
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,517
in operational procedures
in order to reduce the risk.

380
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,085
But it's business as usual.

381
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,454
Information security is
not yet business as usual

382
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,621
for the board.

383
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,158
Why not?

384
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,594
Now if you want to
start up tip from the,

385
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,230
apparently I can take the label

386
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,434
successful
entrepreneur now, yes.

387
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,235
Ask yourself that question.

388
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,469
Don't start with a piece of tech

389
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,072
and try to find
somewhere it fits

390
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,073
in the technology stack.

391
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,509
Start with that
question from the board

392
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,344
and start working your way down.

393
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:03,715
If you find an answer that
helps mature our ability

394
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,351
to manage that risk,
at that kind of level

395
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,687
you are going to have a
highly valuable product

396
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,023
that is durable in the
market for years to come.

397
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,092
It is a very, very
large question.

398
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,361
We're not going to
answer it today.

399
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:20,532
But I find it useful to talk
about and to think about

400
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:24,669
as we try to study and
structure our security industry

401
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,604
as a whole.

402
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,576
And one of the things
that I think is a big gap,

403
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,743
is confidence.

404
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,581
Imagine yourself as the CISO,
sitting in front of the board,

405
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,418
and maybe you've got
an aggressive guy
over in the corner

406
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,087
who's pretty in your face.

407
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,592
And he starts confronting
the CISO, and digging in.

408
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,994
How confident is
that guy going to be

409
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,263
in the efficacy of
the technical controls

410
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,131
he's deployed across
the organization

411
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,601
in order to stop attackers.

412
00:18:55,601 --> 00:19:00,139
The truth is, in most
organizations it's total chaos.

413
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,007
We definitely, we're
trying to manage and herd

414
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,243
a whole bunch of cats.

415
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,644
We've got a whole
slew of controls

416
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,413
across a variety of
layers of the stack,

417
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,215
but we all know
they're all imperfect,

418
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,750
and it's everything
we can do to keep up

419
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,488
with the controls and make
sure everything's squared away.

420
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,490
And very few of our
IT organizations,

421
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,160
they have the discipline
and change control,

422
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,995
configuration
management, the basics

423
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,429
in order to keep everything
nice and squared away,

424
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,466
and we have to
manage within that.

425
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:31,637
The CISO knows that, and he
knows that there's a gap there.

426
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,875
Why is that?

427
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:41,346
It's because, I believe, in
large part to the fact that

428
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,682
we're, most of our
organizations, in the balance of

429
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,484
people, products, and
processes that it takes

430
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:48,120
to manage security, you're more
like that over on the right.

431
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,123
Historically, security has
come out of the IT group.

432
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,927
In the IT world
you buy products,

433
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,795
and the business sees the
value for the product,

434
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,865
and people are a
tax on top of that.

435
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,600
I can't tell you how
many times I as a vendor

436
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,267
have been asked, "How many
people does it take to

437
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,370
administer your software?"

438
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,272
I just shake my head, because
if you're asking that question

439
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,307
you don't get it.

440
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:09,808
You don't understand.

441
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,345
But, in the IT world, we
talk about exchange server

442
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,048
or file server or something
where the value to the business

443
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
comes from the software
and the solution,

444
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,618
that makes perfect
sense, because the people

445
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,186
are a tax on top of it.

446
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,088
In the security
world, especially here
in threat hunting,

447
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:25,290
products like mine,
products support you.

448
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,758
The value to the
business comes from you.

449
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,293
It comes from the people.

450
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,361
And tools are just a tool
in the tool bag to enable

451
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,397
you to do your job.

452
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,234
You can hack it
together with your own

453
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,935
in house scripts
and capabilities,

454
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:37,836
you've seen plenty
of examples of that,

455
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,104
like here today.

456
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,073
Carbon Black, that's
our vision to help you

457
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,443
scale that up at an
enterprise across the board.

458
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:48,113
Choose your poison, it
doesn't matter which.

459
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:57,389
This idea that we can
buy some magic product

460
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,126
and sprinkle a little magic
fairy dust on the top of it,

461
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,962
it's gonna magically protect
against all attackers,

462
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,032
this is a cancer
inside our industry.

463
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,670
The longer that we continue
to cling to this false hope

464
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,207
that we can deploy
some magic product

465
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,377
across our organization
and it will magically

466
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:22,014
stop all attacks, and we
can forget about building

467
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,482
the people and the processes,

468
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,052
it will continually hold
us back from accepting that

469
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,254
and building the solutions of

470
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,824
products, people, and processes

471
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,596
to actually make
progress in security.

472
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,939
So, a lot of you out there
are probably going, duh.

473
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,208
I've heard that three
times yesterday.

474
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,377
And you're right, you did.

475
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,981
I was a little
satisfied, pleased,

476
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,383
and maybe a little
humbled as I sat in

477
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,218
and heard this same
message being given

478
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,655
to you multiple times over
the course of yesterday.

479
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,857
Different words, different
flavors, different spins,

480
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,193
but the same basic message.

481
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,362
My ask to you is why
did all of us think it

482
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,265
important enough to stand
up here today and share it.

483
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,934
It's because inside
this room we think,

484
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,537
yeah that's pretty
much obvious, I get it.

485
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,238
But as soon as you
step outside this room

486
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,274
into the broader organization
and the broader industry,

487
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,275
holy cow, we are unique.

488
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:32,050
My call to you today
is to stand up.

489
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,454
Stand up and be heard.

490
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,055
Stand up and preach
this message.

491
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,459
Stand up lead inside
your organizations.

492
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,595
You may think, I'm not a leader.

493
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,930
That's bullshit.

494
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,334
Everyone is leader, leadership
happens at every level.

495
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,937
You know, we typically,
inside our organizations,

496
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,938
we're schooled in our
society to look for people

497
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,209
in positions of authority as
leaders, the CEO, your boss,

498
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,646
some guy standing up on
stage at an event like this.

499
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,749
And say, he's my leader,
I'm going to listen to him.

500
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,384
But leadership happens
at every level.

501
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,918
It happens up the chain,
it happens down the chain,

502
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,286
it happens from peer to peer.

503
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,123
You can lead.

504
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,592
History is laden
with examples of

505
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:16,228
unexpected leaders
in unexpected places.

506
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,398
Rosa Parks refused to get
up off the seat on her bus,

507
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,869
and she became a leader, a
globally recognized leader

508
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,270
in the Civil Rights movement.

509
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,538
A Chinese man stood
in front of a tank

510
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:30,242
in Tienanmen Square,
and became a symbol

511
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,812
for resistance against
government oppression.

512
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,716
You can lead inside
your organizations,
and you can do it.

513
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,851
And it's got to start
to happen with you.

514
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:44,022
If you believe, stand up for
it, and folks will follow.

515
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,292
But there's another piece.

516
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,961
Leadership requires credibility.

517
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,698
In order to be credible,
you've got to be competent.

518
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:55,967
In order to be a leader
you've got to know

519
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,170
what you believe in, you've
gotta stand up for your beliefs,

520
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,639
you've got to preach it,
you've got to speak it.

521
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:04,275
People must believe in
you in order to follow you

522
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,510
and to follow your message.

523
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,445
In order for people
to believe in you,

524
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,678
you've got to have credibility.

525
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,613
In order for you to
have credibility,

526
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,949
you've got to have competence.

527
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,051
There is no more competence
when it comes to the threat

528
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,922
than the people sitting
right in this room.

529
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,392
With the subject of threat, on
the topic of threat hunting,

530
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,894
and the structure of security
across our organizations,

531
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:26,631
it is very likely you
know more than your boss.

532
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,035
It is probably you know
more than your boss's boss,

533
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,003
and you almost certainly
know more about the threat

534
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,271
than your CISO.

535
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,907
That means that on
this particular topic

536
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,877
of leading change in
information security,

537
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,947
you can lead more strongly
and more effectively

538
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,948
than your CISO.

539
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,684
Don't be looking to those guys

540
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,853
for your leadership
on this topic.

541
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,788
It's gonna require you.

542
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,227
Now you may think, hey
that sounds kinda cool JJ,

543
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,696
I believe you but...

544
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,563
This is backed up by research.

545
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,032
These two guys are
professors at the

546
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,068
University of Santa
Clara in California.

547
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,603
They have been
studying the topic

548
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,571
of leadership for 40 years.

549
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,772
And you know what?

550
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,140
Leadership doesn't
really change.

551
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,110
Leadership today and the
characteristics and traits

552
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,179
that make good leaders are
the same in ancient Greece,

553
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,185
as they were in the Middle
Ages, as they are today.

554
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,721
The two top rules in
their 10 fundamental

555
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,690
truths of leadership, one, you.

556
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,659
You can make a difference,
leaders happen everywhere.

557
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,361
It is not a top down
thing, despite the fact

558
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,830
that we are brainwashed
from day one,

559
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,198
including in our school
systems from kindergarten

560
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,568
to sit quietly in a
room and raise your hand

561
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,235
and respect authority.

562
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,905
You can be a leader.

563
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,443
And, number two,
credibility is the

564
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,346
foundation of leadership.

565
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,650
It's not just my opinion, folks.

566
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,519
And it's gonna take
us to change it.

567
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,022
So I encourage you to stand
up inside your organizations

568
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,591
and make your voice heard.

569
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,525
Change the conversation.

570
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:06,531
Make folks let go
of that false hope

571
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,100
that we think we can
deploy some magic product

572
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,303
that's going to forgo the
need for people and processes

573
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,072
in order to solve security.

574
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,640
We will never fix
the security problem,

575
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,910
at least for a number
of years to go.

576
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,113
In the meantime, all
we can do is our part,

577
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,215
from an engineering
standpoint to apply

578
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,318
incremental improvements,
to continue to chip it away,

579
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,253
and then balance that out
with people and processes.

580
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,357
To balance out the
cost benefit equation.

581
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:35,193
But it doesn't stop there.

582
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:39,164
Because you can make
a difference inside
your organizations,

583
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,033
but when we draw ourselves in
the broader scope of industry,

584
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,103
we are still just a speck.

585
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,838
And there are a whole
lot of organizations

586
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,473
not represented in this room.

587
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,809
And while we can stand up
and individually have a voice

588
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,944
inside our organization, if
we're gonna make a difference

589
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,245
in the information
security industry,

590
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,648
you've got to be heard
outside your org.

591
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,550
So I encourage you
not just to stand up

592
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,921
inside your organizations,
but to do so in the industry.

593
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:06,157
This is a transformative
time of information security,

594
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:07,626
it 100% is.

595
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,028
I have been waiting on
this moment for 15 years,

596
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,063
and it is here.

597
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,667
I'm doing my part, but
I can't do it alone.

598
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:21,773
You can make a difference
inside your organizations,

599
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:25,577
but if you step and you be
heard across the industry,

600
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,412
together we can do it.

601
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,950
We can change the
message industry wide,

602
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,952
and we can change
the conversation,

603
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,287
and we can change our world.

604
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,366
Rob talked about some of our
spooky days back in D.C.,

605
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,737
it was probably
2007 give or take.

606
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,980
And I was in the basement of
a building that doesn't exist

607
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,016
outside the beltway,
the middle of the night,

608
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,352
by myself, providing
what was supposed to be

609
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,523
routine technical support to
a ground operation overseas.

610
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,130
Things went bad, technical.

611
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,099
Y'all are aware with
technical problems, right.

612
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,134
Technical problems
happen everywhere.

613
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,237
Technical problem, stuff
started not working.

614
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:30,408
And given the situation,
because the technical stuff

615
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,883
didn't work, there were
suddenly lives at risk.

616
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,921
I had about 30 minutes of a
window in order to fix it.

617
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,757
This was three o'clock
in the morning.

618
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,726
The number of people that
had the clearance, context,

619
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,228
and capability to assist me,

620
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,964
that list was
already very small.

621
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,868
And the number of people on
that list that I could wake up

622
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,004
and get to this basement of
a building that doesn't exist

623
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:03,841
outside the beltway within
30 minutes was zero.

624
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,347
I was really looking
for that smart guy

625
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,349
in the basement to call.

626
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,552
And then I realized, I'm it.

627
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,758
All the resources of the
United States Government

628
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,694
were all sitting
on my shoulders.

629
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,396
And despite the fact that
none of you were aware,

630
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,899
everybody was depending on me.

631
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,670
Things went fine.

632
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,907
But for me, that was
a crucible moment,

633
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,711
and I still remember
that clearly.

634
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,814
And I reflect upon
that frequently

635
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,750
to remind myself that I don't
have to rely on anyone else.

636
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,386
There is no smart
guy in the basement

637
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,255
who is gonna come tell us how
to do information security.

638
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,392
There is no smart guy inside
your organization besides you

639
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,094
who is gonna stand up and lead

640
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,996
and tell your organization
how to do business.

641
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,531
And in the broader
scope in the industry,

642
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,866
we are the smart
guys in the basement.

643
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,102
We're it, folks. We are it.

644
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,040
And the longer we
continue to cling

645
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,476
to the false hope that
we can fix security

646
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,512
and products are going to solve
all of the security problems

647
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:18,081
the longer we will
continue to be insecure.

648
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,020
Stand up.

649
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,191
This is our crucible as an
information security industry.

650
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,127
We may not have the
acute tactical nature

651
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,062
of my 30 minutes in the
middle of the night,

652
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:35,934
but it is most definitely
a crucible for all of us.

653
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:39,771
And together we can
change the conversation

654
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,005
and we can change our world.

655
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,676
(intense music)
