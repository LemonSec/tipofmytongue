1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,936
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,176
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,444
- Hey, y'all.

4
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,612
We're gonna talk about
some cool stuff today.

5
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,481
The title is very intimidating,

6
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,715
but I sum it up as saying

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:18,051
we're gonna talk
about brain stuff.

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,452
That sounds important, right?

9
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,820
Now, as I go through,

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,956
I want you to be
thinking about a question

11
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,224
as we go through the slides

12
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,725
and as we go through the talk,

13
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,559
and to

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,962
provide this question to you,

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:32,232
I wanna tell you a little
ditty about Jack and Diane.

16
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,368
They're two American kids
growing up in the Heartland,

17
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,437
and they became analysts.

18
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,939
I want you to picture
this in your mind,

19
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,741
these are two kids
out of college.

20
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:45,078
Young, hungry, ready
to get into it,

21
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,579
security, that is.

22
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,848
They're ready to get into it,

23
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,384
and they get jobs as analysts.

24
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,086
They both have the exact
same level of experience.

25
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,189
They're both hired into
the exact same job.

26
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,225
Now, fast-forward five years.

27
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:02,095
At this point, you go in and
you talk to Jack and Diane,

28
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,431
and you find out Diane
has far surpassed

29
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,099
the skill level of Jack.

30
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:09,035
She is the much better
analyst in every way.

31
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,670
She's much better at finding
evil, describing that evil.

32
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,073
She's the better analyst.

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,208
But they both started
at the same time

34
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,743
with the same
relative skill level,

35
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,378
and they had the same job.

36
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,714
So, why is Diane so
much better than Jack?

37
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,650
How do you quantify that?

38
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,019
Well, let's talk about that.

39
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,654
If you don't know me,
my name's Chris Sanders.

40
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,122
I'm from a little town in
Kentucky called Mayfield.

41
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:30,990
That's it, right there.

42
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,491
That's the whole thing.

43
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,426
There's not much there.

44
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,562
We got a couple stoplights.

45
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,831
My background is
mostly in defense.

46
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,933
I worked for Mandiant, as
mentioned, for a little while,

47
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,167
and recently struck
out on my own

48
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,636
at a company called
Applied Network Defense,

49
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:44,604
and I also run a
non-profit called

50
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,139
The Rural Technology Fund.

51
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,342
I've written a few books,
if you like to or can read.

52
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,544
What am I talking about today,

53
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,246
and what is the problem
I'm talking about?

54
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,848
I think it's very
important to clearly state

55
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,550
what problem I
want to talk about,

56
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,753
and how we can address
it in this talk.

57
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,091
My thesis, if you
wanna call it that,

58
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,359
is that information security

59
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,895
is in a state of
cognitive crisis.

60
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,297
That's a big term,

61
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,365
and when you use
the term crisis,

62
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,366
that should mean something,

63
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,434
and I think it does.

64
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,069
I chose it very carefully.

65
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,570
When you say "Cognitive crisis,"

66
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,672
I think you can identify
that sort of thing

67
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,508
through three specific criteria.

68
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,710
I wanna talk through those here.

69
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,045
Number one is that the
demand for expertise

70
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,847
greatly outweighs the supply.

71
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,049
How many of you in here

72
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,451
are responsible for
hiring people right now,

73
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,619
especially in the hunting realm?

74
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,554
Show of hands.

75
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,822
Quite a few of you, right?

76
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,357
You know how hard
it can be to find

77
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:41,961
skilled, qualified practitioners
in this area, right?

78
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,631
Many of you are probably,
maybe not too long ago

79
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,332
were trying to find
jobs as a hunter,

80
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,600
but you know what?

81
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,567
If you didn't have
any experience,

82
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,103
it was also hard to find a job

83
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,672
because people only wanna
hire people with experience.

84
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,907
They need highly-skilled people.

85
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,808
They don't need
entry-level people,

86
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,109
and that's all because we have

87
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,047
a little bit of a skills
shortage in some degree.

88
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,983
The second symptom is that
most information in security

89
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,020
cannot really be
trusted or validated,

90
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,422
so we have this real
absence of peer review

91
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,890
in our industry.

92
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,660
Most of the information we
consume is consumed via blogs,

93
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,528
and anybody can post a blog.

94
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,829
It can go out of date, and
nobody will take it down.

95
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,232
It can say a bunch of malarkey

96
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,035
and no one can necessarily
refute it in a way

97
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,337
that actually changes that
content or influences it.

98
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,439
Someone can just
refuse to change it.

99
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,474
That's not really a
great scenario to be in,

100
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,942
especially if you're young,
new in this industry,

101
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,678
and you're relying
on this information

102
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:36,149
to help you advance your
career, fight evil, et cetera.

103
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,984
Number three is that we have
an inability to mobilize

104
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,053
and tackle big systemic issues.

105
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,055
Look no further than your most
recent ransomware infection.

106
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,457
I'm of the opinion ransomware

107
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,159
is one of the most significant
broad-spectrum threats

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,694
that we've faced in a long time

109
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,661
in regards to something
that affects everybody,

110
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,564
from the big mega-corporations

111
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,299
all the way down
to Joe's Bait Shop

112
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,269
when their computer
gets infected.

113
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,538
And Joe's a good guy and
he has good prices on bait,

114
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,039
so I don't wanna,

115
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,608
I'd hate for him to get
ransomware on his computers.

116
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,444
Now, interesting
thing about this,

117
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,646
and I talk about this,
I frame this a lot,

118
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,648
I frame a lot of things I
talk about through medicine,

119
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,316
because we're in a
cognitive crisis now

120
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,418
and I don't think that's
really too questionable.

121
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,421
Medicine, we think of as a
really, really robust science.

122
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,055
Medicine has a lot of problems,

123
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,791
but it's not really
about medical science
most of the time,

124
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,326
now that we have
evidence-based medicine.

125
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,161
It's more about
insurance and bureaucracy

126
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,630
and things of that nature.

127
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,634
But, 100 years ago, almost
exactly 100 years ago,

128
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:28,835
medicine really went through

129
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,969
this whole cognitive
crisis as well.

130
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,873
Really, these three symptoms
that are listed here,

131
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,442
they apply to medicine,
if you think about it.

132
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,745
Demand for expertise
greatly outweighs supply.

133
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,346
Most towns didn't have a doctor.

134
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:44,217
If they did, your doctor was
also your dentist and your vet,

135
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,219
and maybe sold you milk.

136
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,755
If that was the case,

137
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,256
you'd better hope you
have a doctor in your town

138
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,224
or you're not too sick to
make it to a town with one.

139
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,293
Most information in
the medical field

140
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,627
cannot be trusted or validated.

141
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,296
We still have artifacts
of that today.

142
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,697
Up until 30 years ago,

143
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,432
most medical
practitioners thought

144
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,100
that if you had stomach ulcers,

145
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,635
you should drink milk.

146
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,771
Now we know that's the exact
opposite thing you wanna do.

147
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,105
You don't wanna drink milk
if you have a stomach ulcer.

148
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,440
You're gonna have a bad time.

149
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,641
But it took us up
until just 30 years ago

150
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,842
to figure that out,

151
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,277
once that was retested
and re-validated,

152
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,844
and we weren't just
taking old wives' tales

153
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:15,148
for what they were.

154
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,716
In terms of
inability to mobilize

155
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,751
and tackle big systemic issues,

156
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,488
look no further than any
plague of your choice.

157
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,757
We have plagues that wiped
out a third of Europe, right?

158
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,360
That's pretty substantial.

159
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,262
Medicine went through a
similar cognitive crisis,

160
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,897
but they really came out
on the other end of it,

161
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,000
and we have this concept
of evidence-based medicine,

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,702
where you're doing
scientific research,

163
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,437
you're having this
concept of peer review,

164
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,539
and you're taking the
creation of knowledge,

165
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,808
and it's based upon other
validated knowledge,

166
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:43,343
which is something
we don't have yet.

167
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,346
Now, medicine is a
very specific field

168
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,847
in how you're trained.

169
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,448
I don't think whatever the
answer was for medicine,

170
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,117
in terms of medical school
and residency and all that,

171
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,852
I don't think that's
the answer for us,

172
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,152
but I do think we
can look at medicine

173
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,855
and how they formalized things

174
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,357
and how they researched
their problems,

175
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,624
their cognitive crisis,

176
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,959
how they came out of
the other end of it,

177
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,662
and we can use that to
really make judgments

178
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,765
and learn things about our own
field and our own practices.

179
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,501
I think that's a reasonable
approach to this,

180
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,703
and that's at least my approach.

181
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,804
That's what I'm gonna
talk about today.

182
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,272
That's the problem as I see it,

183
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,008
and why I'm taking the
position I'm taking here.

184
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,878
It's very critical to
talk about assumptions.

185
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,514
At risk of having people
throw tomatoes at me

186
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,216
for talking about a
definition of hunting,

187
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,384
I generally say
it doesn't matter

188
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,551
what your definition
of hunting is,

189
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,019
as long as you clarify it

190
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,957
so people can base what
they do on that assumption.

191
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,726
When I talk about hunting, I
think about investigations.

192
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,927
I have this thing called

193
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,429
the universal
investigation process,

194
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,696
which I've blogged about,

195
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,832
and maybe some of you
have read about that.

196
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,835
It's really the process
you see on the screen here.

197
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,570
I'll walk you through
that really quickly,

198
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,805
'cause I wanna talk about
where hunting fits in

199
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,674
so we can move on and
move past that quickly.

200
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:49,909
With any type of investigation,

201
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,745
you have some type
of observation.

202
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,282
If you're doing event analysis,
maybe that's an alert.

203
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,116
Pretty straightforward.

204
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,351
If you're doing hunting,

205
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,585
maybe that's something
you manually found.

206
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,520
You get some type
of aggregation.

207
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,753
Some of the great techniques

208
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,889
the other speakers have
talked about this far,

209
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,925
something with
PowerShell, et cetera.

210
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,260
Once you make that observation,

211
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,695
that's when the investigation
begins in earnest.

212
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,765
Once you have data to look
at, you're asking a question.

213
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,032
A lot of people alluded
to the same thing,

214
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,535
questions and hypotheses.

215
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,336
You ask a question
about that data

216
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,905
that will further
the investigation.

217
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,541
What you're actually doing
is trying to bridge the gap

218
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,776
between perception and reality.

219
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,244
That's all an investigation is.

220
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,980
We want our perception
of events that transpired

221
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,584
to match the reality of
what really did transpire.

222
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,919
Perception and reality are
two very different things,

223
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,486
but we want them to be
as close as possible.

224
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,389
That's the investigation.

225
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,191
We ask questions to pursue that.

226
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,325
When we ask a question,
we generate a hypothesis.

227
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,928
It's human nature.

228
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,363
When we have a question,
we lean a certain way.

229
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,633
Then we go out and seek
answers to test our hypothesis.

230
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,037
We seek to confirm
it or invalidate it.

231
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,438
Either way, we get an answer,

232
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,140
and that answer will generally
beget more questions.

233
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,108
This repeats over and over again

234
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,777
until we get to a conclusion,

235
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,779
which is usually, did
something bad occur?

236
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,615
If so, how bad, and
where, and so on.

237
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,418
That's the universal
investigation process.

238
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,652
Now, if you look at
this, you might say,

239
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,221
"Hey, this looks
kinda familiar."

240
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,889
And you'd be right.

241
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,459
It looks pretty similar
to the scientific method.

242
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,727
There's a reason for that.

243
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,195
We don't have the
scientific method

244
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:17,462
because a bunch of old
guys sat in a room one day

245
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,066
and said, "This is how
we should do science."

246
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,566
We have that because
they looked at how

247
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,637
scientific discovery in the
best scenarios was done,

248
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,872
and they mapped it out,

249
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,039
because they knew if we
could take this thing

250
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,608
that's occurring subconsciously,

251
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,743
bring it into our conscious
thought, and teach to it,

252
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,179
we're giving new
people in science

253
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,313
a better way to
get jump-started,

254
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:36,716
and we're giving them
something that we can teach to,

255
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,116
and it's gonna result
in more and accelerated

256
00:08:38,116 --> 00:08:39,684
scientific discovery.

257
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,152
I believe this similar approach

258
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,922
can work for what we're doing,

259
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,490
and not only do I believe in it,

260
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,426
I've seen empirical proof
that we can do that.

261
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,530
I'll talk about some
of that as we go along.

262
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,198
The keyword here as
well is universal,

263
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,132
and I think that's important

264
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,400
since we're at a hunting summit.

265
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,369
How does hunting fit in?

266
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,270
From my perspective,

267
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,804
looking at the

268
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,908
cognitive underpinnings of
how we do investigations,

269
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:02,909
tools aside,

270
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,280
generally, the investigation
process is mostly the same,

271
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,747
whether you're doing hunting

272
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:13,119
or you're doing general
alert-driven investigation.

273
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,855
The only difference is
that observation stage.

274
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,891
With an alert, I'm giving
you something to investigate.

275
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,294
It's basically giving
you your question.

276
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,228
I wanna be clear on that.

277
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,295
An alert is not an answer.

278
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,530
An alert is simply a question

279
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,898
that you have to go
forth and pursue.

280
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,366
An alert gives you a
question, and certainly,

281
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,502
you could do hunting from
lower-fidelity alerts

282
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,736
and things like that, too,

283
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,138
but otherwise,

284
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,841
if you're trying to
manually find observations,

285
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,343
then that's gonna be
a bit longer process.

286
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,545
But it's still all contained
within this observation stage,

287
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,247
and there's of course
different strategies for that,

288
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,814
some of those which
we've talked about

289
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,650
here at the conference
with other speakers.

290
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,319
Again, the universal
investigation process.

291
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:47,819
That's what we're
talking about here

292
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,724
in the context of what I'm
gonna speak about next.

293
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,992
Let's get to some data.

294
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,428
We talked about Jack
and Diane earlier.

295
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
We talked about
experience, right?

296
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,232
And a lot of us like to
quantify experience in years.

297
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,834
I have five years experience,
I have 10 years experience,

298
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,871
when I think we all really
know my five years experience

299
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,039
is probably very different

300
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,240
than your five
years of experience.

301
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,408
Everyone's is.

302
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,510
Experience is not
simply a measurement of

303
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,579
years of doing something.

304
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,449
It's a completely
different thing.

305
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,785
So, I think it's
incredibly important to

306
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,387
figure out what that means.

307
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,623
What is experience?

308
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,125
What separates an
experienced analyst,

309
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,660
whether it's a typical

310
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,895
alert-driven
investigation-focused
person or a hunter,

311
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:33,499
what separates that from someone
who is lesser-experienced?

312
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,734
That's very important,

313
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,402
because if we know that,
we can teach to it.

314
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,471
I did an experiment.

315
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,673
I put out a call on
my blog, and I said,

316
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,141
"Hey, I wanna talk
to investigators

317
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,809
"of all varying skill levels."

318
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,877
I think maybe even a
couple of you in this room

319
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,911
probably participated in that.

320
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,781
I got on the phone or
on Skype with them,

321
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,815
and we had a phone call,

322
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,785
and I had 'em walk me
through at least one

323
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,554
of the investigations that
they had gone through,

324
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,622
oftentimes many,
and I recorded it,

325
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,759
and I did a key phrase
mapping exercise.

326
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,827
And that basically means
is I had a set of phrases

327
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,295
in certain categories,

328
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,131
and I would map the things
they said to those categories

329
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,598
to try to figure
out the breakdown

330
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,268
of how they went through
this investigation.

331
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,470
This isn't a perfect
research method,

332
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,938
but it does shed some
light on, I think,

333
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,308
the differences between
novices and experts.

334
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,543
Now, really quickly,

335
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:18,778
I wanna talk about
dual process theory.

336
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,979
This is kind of a big subject,

337
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,416
so I'll give you the
$1.99 description of it.

338
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,553
Dual process theory basically
says that, in our head,

339
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,022
we generally have two
complementary thought processes

340
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,691
going on at the same time.

341
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,360
We have intuition,
which is fast thought.

342
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,494
When you think of intuition,

343
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,729
you think about
driving home from work.

344
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,463
You don't really have
to think about that,

345
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,798
you just do it.

346
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,866
If I say, "What's
five plus five,"

347
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,967
you don't really have
to think about that,

348
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,769
you just spout out the answer.

349
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,737
Most of the time.

350
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,005
Maybe not if you're onstage,

351
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:46,972
which is why I'm not
gonna try to answer it

352
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,241
and accidentally say 12 now.

353
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,776
And you also have
reflective thought,

354
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,444
which is the other side, which
is more deliberate thought.

355
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,013
If I say, "What's 12 times 47,"

356
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,681
you're probably gonna
have to think about that.

357
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,718
You know, carry the one,
et cetera, et cetera.

358
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,819
Driving when you were 16

359
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,021
and you were learning
how to drive,

360
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,488
you really had to
think about it, right?

361
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,890
You had to think about
staying between the lines,

362
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,625
you had to think about
shifting if you had a manual,

363
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,960
all those different things.

364
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,429
Two competing or complementary
types of thought,

365
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,697
depending on how
you wanna view 'em.

366
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,631
There's a really
great book on this

367
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,500
called Thinking Fast and Slow,

368
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,302
if you wanna learn about that.

369
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,770
So, we have these
two types of thought,

370
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,639
and we have these different
categories that fall into them.

371
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,442
You see intuition on one side
and reflection on the other,

372
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,411
and we'll go through some
of those in a minute.

373
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,313
The thing I wanna talk about
briefly is metacognition,

374
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,215
which is the thing
you see in the middle.

375
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,483
Metacognition is a
really fancy word

376
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,417
that means thinking
about thinking.

377
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,986
Thinking about your
thought processes,

378
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,722
being aware of how you're
processing information.

379
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,824
Metacognition is
critically important.

380
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,992
Let's look at the data.

381
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,230
Now, what you see here are
the average number of results

382
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,966
amongst the people I talked to.

383
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,934
Novices, so, people with
very little experience,

384
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,502
are the ones in blue.

385
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,140
Experts, or the people with a
ton of experience, are in red.

386
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,275
There's a lot of data here.

387
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,510
Like, a lot.

388
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,477
I don't even know what
some of this stuff

389
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,079
really tangibly means quite yet,

390
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,314
but there is some of
it I think we get,

391
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,616
some conclusions we
can probably draw,

392
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,117
or at least some things
that the data suggests

393
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,218
which I think are important.

394
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,255
If you look on the left
on the intuition side,

395
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,056
you see incubation.

396
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,892
Incubation basically means

397
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,594
you see something
a little weird,

398
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,163
but you don't know
what to do with it.

399
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,631
So, what do you do when you
don't know what to do with it?

400
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,632
You just put it to
the back of your mind.

401
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,434
That's incubation.

402
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,538
You notice we have a lot
larger number of responses

403
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,341
related to incubation
from novices than experts,

404
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,276
and that makes sense.

405
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,477
It passes the sniff test.

406
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,212
If I'm a novice, I'm
probably, first of all,

407
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:34,947
gonna see more things
that look weird to me

408
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,248
because I've seen less things,

409
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,516
and I'm gonna see things

410
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,717
that don't make as
much sense to me,

411
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,952
so I'm probably
gonna incubate them

412
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,620
'cause I don't know
what to do with them.

413
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,855
Now, I want you to contrast that

414
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,557
with something on the
other side of the chart.

415
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,925
We see on the right side,

416
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,194
we have rule-based
reasoning under reflection.

417
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,428
Rule-based reasoning
should be really

418
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,963
easy for this crowd
to understand.

419
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,432
Think of an if statement.

420
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,000
If this, then that.

421
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,402
That's essentially what
rule-based reasoning is,

422
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,204
but in our brains.

423
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,573
We build this library
of rules or heuristics,

424
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03,042
where we take certain inputs
and, based on those inputs,

425
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,944
we map those to certain outputs.

426
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,911
We see a larger
number of responses

427
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,949
for experts in the
rule-based reasoning section.

428
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,684
Also passes the
sniff test, right?

429
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,185
If you've been doing
this for 20 years,

430
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,220
you probably have a lot of
rules built into your head,

431
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,022
where, when I see
this bad thing,

432
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,193
or when I see a .top domain,
I know it's probably evil.

433
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,298
I'm gonna assume that's
evil and act accordingly.

434
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,566
It makes sense that
experts would have

435
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,868
a larger number of those.

436
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,203
I think what we see
here, to some degree,

437
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,006
is a bit of an
inverse relationship.

438
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,809
As incubation goes up,
rule-based reasoning goes down,

439
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,043
and vice-versa.

440
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,012
As you build more of these
rules, these heuristics,

441
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,482
to learn how to
do investigations,

442
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,218
you basically don't have
to incubate as much.

443
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,922
First of all, you're seeing
less things that look weird,

444
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,157
because you know what
those are automatically,

445
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,994
and when you do see them,
you know what to do about it.

446
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,996
That tells us, what
are those rules?

447
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,399
What are those rules that
we can boil things down to?

448
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,001
Chances are, a lot of
you have probably learned

449
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,169
a lot of those in the
past day and a half,

450
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,437
watching these talks.

451
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,107
When I see this thing,
it means this thing.

452
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,641
That's pretty cool.

453
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,043
The other thing I wanna talk
about is the middle section,

454
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,478
which is metacognition.

455
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,045
This is really neat
because, across the board,

456
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,715
experts generally have
a much larger number

457
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,418
of metacognition-related
responses.

458
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,487
They're more
metacognitively aware.

459
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,688
This is critically important,

460
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,089
'cause there's a
lot of really great

461
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,524
scientific, peer-reviewed,
validated research

462
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,027
out there amongst
many fields that says

463
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,863
practitioners in
mentally-intensive tasks

464
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,198
are much better
at that their job

465
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,034
when they're
metacognitively aware.

466
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:38,270
They've done this test
with doctors, with nurses,

467
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,805
even leaving the medical field,

468
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,373
they've done it with lawyers,
they've done it with teachers,

469
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,344
and they're all better or
seen as better in their jobs

470
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,912
when they're
metacognitively aware.

471
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,147
When they're knowledgeable

472
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,549
about their own
thought processes,

473
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,953
and when they can apply that
knowledge to their jobs.

474
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,187
That's a big part, I think,

475
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,156
of coming out of the
cognitive crisis,

476
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,092
and a part of why I'm
really speaking here.

477
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,494
We talk about how you become
more metacognitively aware.

478
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,929
This talk is part of that.

479
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,396
It's learning how we think,

480
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,933
learning the difference between
our novices and our experts

481
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,103
and how we bridge
that experience gap.

482
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,407
Next, what is the X-factor
that makes a good hunter?

483
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,176
I'm sure we all have a
lot of opinions on this.

484
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,677
I could probably ask 100 people,

485
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,814
and I'd probably get 70
or 80 different responses.

486
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,281
I have my opinion, and
since I'm the one onstage,

487
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,352
I'm gonna tell you
what my opinion is.

488
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,387
For me, it's curiosity.

489
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,555
It's the ability to see things

490
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,258
and the desire to go out
and do something about it.

491
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,194
There's a lot of really fancy
definitions of curiosity.

492
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,229
I think the best one is
simply the desire to know.

493
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,598
It's not the ability to know.

494
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:40,565
That's a completely
different thing.

495
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,034
It's the desire,

496
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,535
the desire to see that weird
thing and go out and pursue it,

497
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,036
go out and run a Google search

498
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,206
and figure out where you can
find out about it, et cetera.

499
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,974
The desire to know.

500
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,543
Now, curiosity's important
because it relates

501
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,781
very closely to experience
in a lot of ways.

502
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,150
I drew this chart up because
I think this really describes,

503
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,418
in a lot of ways,

504
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,353
how experience and
curiosity relate,

505
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,589
how they manifest for
security analysts,

506
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,057
at least in my career.

507
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,492
So, you see we have a
green area and a red area.

508
00:17:07,492 --> 00:17:10,229
Surprise, green is
good, red is bad.

509
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,398
We have the top right, there,

510
00:17:12,397 --> 00:17:13,765
we see High C, High E.

511
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,868
That means high curiosity,
high experience.

512
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:16,801
These are people who have been

513
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,069
doing this for a long time,

514
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,671
are insanely curious,
and as a result of it,

515
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,007
they excel greatly
in their jobs.

516
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,909
I think you would find
most people who you know

517
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,210
who have been doing this a while

518
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,779
and you would
consider really good

519
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,548
are also highly
curious individuals.

520
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,649
Now, that's an ideal state,

521
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,949
but with experience,

522
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,419
we don't all start with
a lot of experience.

523
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,887
Some of us start
with no experience.

524
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,388
But curiosity still matters,

525
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,456
and that's what we see on
the other side of the chart,

526
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,092
what I call Jumpy.

527
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,929
Jumpy's not bad, as long
as Jumpy is directed.

528
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,166
Some of us have been in
security operation centers

529
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,399
where we're the manager,

530
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,668
and we're responsible
for training people,

531
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,071
and you have someone who
is a year into the job

532
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,372
and everything
looks evil, right?

533
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,841
They're filing
tickets all day long,

534
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,010
and it turns out that
90% of what they see

535
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,211
is actually not evil,

536
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,446
they just don't know
what they're looking at.

537
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,780
And that's okay, as
long as that's guided

538
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,616
and they have mentorship
to get through that.

539
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,787
Low experience, high
curiosity, that's great.

540
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:09,988
Notice on the top side,

541
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,558
those are both related
to high curiosity.

542
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,893
You have to have that
high level of curiosity.

543
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,195
The level of experience
doesn't matter.

544
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,629
You'll gain experience,

545
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,231
and I would posit you would
gain experience faster

546
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,867
if you had that higher
degree of curiosity.

547
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,101
Our example of Jack and Diane,

548
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,570
I would say the thing
that separates them

549
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,371
is that Diane is
generally probably

550
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,875
would exhibit higher degrees
of curiosity than Jack,

551
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,545
and perhaps that's why she
was excelling more than Jack.

552
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,115
Now, there's conflicting
variables there.

553
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,349
Certainly could be some
other things, right,

554
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,951
but that's what I would
say if I had to guess

555
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,687
and all other
variables being equal.

556
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,155
On the bottom of this,

557
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,524
we see a couple things we're
probably familiar with.

558
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,258
We see the Apathetic area,

559
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,494
and we all know people like this

560
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,228
who have been doing
it for 15 or 20 years,

561
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,231
and they've just
kinda phoned it in.

562
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,566
They're either collecting
the nice paycheck,

563
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,301
they don't have a lot of
responsibility on them,

564
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,402
so they've got all
this experience,

565
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,171
but they're not growing anymore.

566
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,707
That's Apathetic in this job.

567
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,242
And then we have the
Ineffective section,

568
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,344
which is, very simply, low
curiosity, low experience.

569
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,612
These folks don't know
what they're looking at,

570
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,880
and because of a
lack of curiosity,

571
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,047
they're gonna have
a really hard time

572
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,917
getting to the
point where they do.

573
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,722
Hiring practices, curiosity is
something we want to look at.

574
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,491
Now, I did a little
experiment with this, too,

575
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,896
and I used a sim across a
few different organizations,

576
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,397
and I mapped,

577
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,932
these were organizations where
they have clear delineation

578
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,600
between people who are hunters

579
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,137
and who are just typical
alert-driven analysts.

580
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,405
Since this is the
hunting summit,

581
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,907
I thought this was
neat to highlight.

582
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,774
This is the average number
of investigation activities

583
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,044
per day for those groups.

584
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,546
So, for four individuals
who were hunters,

585
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:44,783
versus those who are
alert-driven analysts.

586
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,217
We see a couple things here.

587
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,854
One we see is the hunters,
which is the orange color there,

588
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,957
a lot greater number of
general activities in general.

589
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,192
When I say an activity,

590
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,695
I'm referring to things
like searches, pivots,

591
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,964
clicking on certain things
that are investigation-related

592
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,367
within the context
of the specific tool.

593
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,569
We definitely see that hunters

594
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,903
do a lot more things in general,

595
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,738
and that's interesting,

596
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,207
but I don't think
it's necessarily

597
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,676
the most interesting thing
related to curiosity.

598
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,377
But I think this part is.

599
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,514
Look at the timestamps
below there.

600
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,716
About how many of you have been

601
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,053
lying in bed, if you're
me, at 10 o'clock at night,

602
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,055
and you're on Twitter,

603
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,990
and all of a sudden,
something pops up.

604
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,725
Some new indicator was released,

605
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,293
or some new report was released,

606
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,895
and you say, "Oh,
man, that's neat!

607
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,763
"I wonder if there's
any of that in my data."

608
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,631
Right, a lot of you, probably.

609
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,803
I think that is a good
pseudo-indicator of curiosity.

610
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,906
The people who, again,
have the desire to know.

611
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,873
You found this new thing,

612
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,175
and you have a desire to know

613
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,209
if there's evidence of
that on your network,

614
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,211
so you go search it out.

615
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:48,580
You see that's
occurring, you know,

616
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,947
late night hours,
early in the morning.

617
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,850
I'm not saying you
have to do those things

618
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,453
to be curious and
be a good hunter.

619
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,754
That's definitely not the case.

620
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,055
But I do think that's
some tangential evidence

621
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,760
that curiosity is particularly
important in hunting,

622
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,095
because hunting relies so much

623
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,630
on generating
observations by yourself,

624
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,666
as opposed to relying on them

625
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,667
from alerts.

626
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,471
This brings up some
interesting questions.

627
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,873
Number one is, can
we measure curiosity?

628
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,175
Can we objectively measure it?

629
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,244
Psychologically, there
are tests that will

630
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,413
measure that type of thing.

631
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,548
They're expensive to do.

632
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,183
You have to have someone who
is a psychologist, basically,

633
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,585
to evaluate that.

634
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:28,654
They're a little tricky

635
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,056
and they're not super
domain-specific.

636
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,824
Can we do that in a
domain-specific way,

637
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,827
and if we can, can
we teach curiosity?

638
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,029
Is it something we're born with,

639
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,398
or can we actually make
people more curious?

640
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,666
That's a good question.

641
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,668
It's not a question
for this talk, but,

642
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,636
I would say yes.

643
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,171
I think we have to get there,

644
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,406
and I think some of us are
probably already doing that

645
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,707
whether we realize it or not.

646
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:50,876
So, curiosity.

647
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,445
Next thing I'm gonna talk about

648
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,179
is the sequence of
the investigation.

649
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,715
A lot of people would say

650
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,617
that it doesn't matter how
your investigation goes,

651
00:21:58,617 --> 00:21:59,885
the path you take,

652
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,153
as long as you get to
the correct answer,

653
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,387
and I couldn't disagree more.

654
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,589
I'm gonna talk about
a few reasons why.

655
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,326
Studying the investigation
is really, really hard.

656
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,627
Everyone has a
different tool set.

657
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,995
We're all running
different sims.

658
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,731
Some of us have custom-built
stuff, et cetera.

659
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,732
This was not an
easy thing to study.

660
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,667
I had to build a custom tool,

661
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,502
an investigation
simulator, if you will.

662
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,937
I call it Investigation Ninja,

663
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,174
and it allows people to
go in and get an alert,

664
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,676
and investigate that in
a tool-agnostic manner.

665
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,144
They can't just go
look at the data.

666
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,281
They have to ask the right
questions to get at the data.

667
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,549
I think that's very important,

668
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,451
'cause again, this
is question-based.

669
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,952
When they do this,

670
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:36,288
I can go in and then look
at their investigations,

671
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,823
and this is a pretty
neat teaching tool, too,

672
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,225
when you can review
your own investigation

673
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,493
and how you went
through that process.

674
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,994
I can go through
and review these,

675
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,330
and at this point, it allows
me to do some actual science.

676
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,399
I can define an
independent variable

677
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,369
and see the effect of that
on the dependent variable.

678
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,536
Controlled experiments,
that's awesome!

679
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,805
So that's what I did,

680
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:54,639
and I wanna talk about
just a couple things

681
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:55,974
I found from that

682
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,810
here.

683
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,413
The first question I asked,
is too much data a real thing?

684
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,714
A lot of us have the
problem of not enough data,

685
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,948
not enough visibility.

686
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,518
But too much data is
a real thing as well,

687
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,353
and I wanna talk about that,

688
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:12,224
particularly in relation
to packet capture data.

689
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,925
I love packet capture data.

690
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,260
I literally wrote
a book on packets.

691
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,661
Like, I love it.

692
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,130
But I will say,

693
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,832
I don't think it's always
the best thing to start with,

694
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,067
and there are good reasons why.

695
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,369
I ran an experiment
with a group of folks,

696
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,870
and I had an investigation.

697
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,939
I said, "Okay, go forth and
solve this investigation,"

698
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,841
and I measured time to close.

699
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,376
So, the time from
when they started

700
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,845
to the time that they came up
with the correct disposition.

701
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,781
You see that on this chart here.

702
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,149
What I did is I measured
based on the opening move.

703
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,618
When I say opening move,

704
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,686
I said, "What is the first
data source someone looks at,

705
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,356
"and how does that affect
their time to close?"

706
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,524
You see on this chart,

707
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,191
it took people
significantly longer

708
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,561
to get to the correct
answer when they started

709
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,996
with packet capture data.

710
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,432
Well, that's neat.

711
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,200
I love packet capture, but
that's not a good thing, right?

712
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,768
So I said, "Let's compare
this to something else.

713
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,804
"Let's compare this to a
similar type of data source."

714
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,405
Packet capture is a lot of data.

715
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:01,673
It's a lot to sift through,

716
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,341
it's very time-consuming,
et cetera.

717
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,110
I said, "Let's take Bro data."

718
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,311
We all know Bro.

719
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,745
It takes a PCAP and
distills it down

720
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:12,317
to just really important
particular facets of the PCAP.

721
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,653
So I did that, and I took
the exact same scenario,

722
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,823
replaced the PCAP data
with the Bro data.

723
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,057
What do you all think happened?

724
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,359
Did the time to close
go up or go down?

725
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,462
Well, it would be a very crappy
presentation if it went up.

726
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,530
That wouldn't really
prove my point.

727
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,033
It went down, it normalized.

728
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,069
In this case, it brought
that time to close down

729
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,639
on par with Flow and
OSINT information.

730
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,140
That suggests some things,

731
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,009
and when I say it like this,
it sounds a lot more obvious.

732
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,978
Better organization of
high-context data sources

733
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:43,381
can yield improvement in
an analyst's performance.

734
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,716
This isn't to say PCAP's bad.

735
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,851
You're not gonna
find too many people

736
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,619
who love packet
capture more than I do.

737
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,321
But it means you probably
shouldn't start there.

738
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,890
It means you should start
with constrained timeframes,

739
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,392
constrained host.

740
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,329
Don't pull 10 minutes of PCAP
for a whole network segment.

741
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,731
Don't pull an hour of PCAP
for an individual host.

742
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,666
Narrow down to the specific
timeframe you need,

743
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,235
the specific host you
need, and start there.

744
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,738
Flow data is a great
way to do that.

745
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,940
There's a talk coming up a
little later on Flow data

746
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,041
that I highly
recommend you watch,

747
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,610
'cause Flow data's amazing.

748
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,879
I would say I love Flow
data more than PCAP data,

749
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:14,779
and I know that's a
little sacrilegious,

750
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,548
but it is what it is.

751
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,751
Next question, and
this is a new one.

752
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,485
The experiment I
just talked about,

753
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,355
I've done a writeup
about that on my blog.

754
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,723
If you wanna read more
details about the methodology,

755
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,658
it's all out there.

756
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,325
Now, for the next
question I asked,

757
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,594
"What data transformations

758
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,197
"were most often used
in positive findings?"

759
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,600
I did this specifically for
learning more about hunting.

760
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,703
I started out, and I
looked at all of the

761
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,639
declared incidents I found that
were spawned from an alert.

762
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,908
So, someone had an alert.

763
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,910
They investigated, and
it led to an incident.

764
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,013
Most of these I'll say are
just commodity incidents.

765
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,680
We're not talking
about really high-level

766
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,750
nation/state stuff.

767
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,787
I looked at these four types
of data transformations.

768
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,222
I'll list these really quickly.

769
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,392
A pivot means you have results
from some type of query,

770
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,860
and you take a field
from that result

771
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,027
and use that to search

772
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,529
in a completely
different data source.

773
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,165
So, like pivoting
from Flow to PCAP.

774
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,968
An aggregation is
taking a specific field

775
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,202
within a dataset,

776
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,238
like, let's say, the
user agent field,

777
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,574
and sorting on all
the unique values.

778
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,609
That's an aggregation.

779
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,778
Expansion/reduction,
simply making a search,

780
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,348
and then reducing or enhancing
the scope of that search.

781
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,350
And visualization's
pretty self-explanatory,

782
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,217
visualizing the
data in some type of

783
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:28,820
hopefully useful way.

784
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,456
For alert-driven investigations,

785
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,924
we see here, first of all,

786
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,293
expansions/reductions were
used 100% of the time.

787
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,094
That's what that
means, right there.

788
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,464
Pivots were used quite
a bit, 76% of the time.

789
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,499
Aggregations only
23% of the time,

790
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,734
and it's hard to
see visualizations,

791
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,704
but that was less
than 1% of the time.

792
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,906
Now, this is fairly
interesting itself,

793
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,874
but let's compare
that to hunting.

794
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,943
I did the same data
review, but in this case,

795
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,579
I did it specifically
for cases I found

796
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,047
where it started with someone

797
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:58,116
manually hunting
for observations,

798
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,384
and then going through
the investigation process

799
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,620
to find something bad.

800
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,588
Here's what that looks like.

801
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,689
In this case you see again,

802
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,558
expansions and
reductions, still 100%.

803
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,426
We've got those going
on all the time.

804
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,196
We do have quite a bit
more pivoting as well.

805
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:12,397
That makes sense.

806
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,598
You're gonna be
doing a lot of that.

807
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,599
You're not gonna stay
within the context

808
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,601
of one individual data source.

809
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,802
The thing I thought
was really interesting

810
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,170
was how many more
aggregations went on.

811
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,607
What I found anecdotally,
it's not represented here,

812
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,442
was that most of these
hunts generally started

813
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,944
from some type of aggregation,

814
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:27,412
just like the one I
mentioned a second ago,

815
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,982
where you're taking all the
user agents in your organization

816
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,417
and sorting on those,

817
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,584
and looking for the least
frequent occurrence,

818
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,353
and that's an outlier, right?

819
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:39,024
The great talk earlier
about the ShimCache parsing,

820
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,191
and that awesome tool and how
it did some of that for you,

821
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:42,694
that's amazing.

822
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,229
That's the kind of stuff
hunting often starts from.

823
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,064
So, we see aggregations are
a much bigger part of that.

824
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,000
We see visualizations still
not a big part of that,

825
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,703
and I will say that
this was a case where

826
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,937
visualizations
could've been used,

827
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,808
but were generally not used
in a way that was meaningful.

828
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,577
This isn't a way for me to
say, "Damn all visualizations,"

829
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,079
I don't think that's
the case at all.

830
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,481
They just weren't used
tremendously here.

831
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,949
I think this is neat.

832
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,152
I think this points out a
little bit of the difference,

833
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,086
what little difference
I think there is

834
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,988
between hunting and alerts,

835
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,891
in terms of how they actually
manifest in dealing with data,

836
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,392
and it also tells
us a little bit more

837
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,661
about maybe what we need
to teach to and build to.

838
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,496
If aggregations
are so important,

839
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:19,998
well, we darn sure
better make sure

840
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:22,500
the folks we're training
know exactly what one is,

841
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,968
how to build one,

842
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,503
make sure we have tools
that allow them to do that,

843
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,938
and help them find great
locations within the data

844
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,808
to do that in, right?

845
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,876
Just listing out place where
aggregations make sense,

846
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,979
and doing those on
a periodic basis.

847
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,314
So, pretty neat.

848
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,250
We're gonna wrap up here.

849
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,352
One of the questions
I get really often is,

850
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,687
"How can I do similar research?"

851
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,022
And I think that's important.

852
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,322
This research is hard.

853
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,658
I'm having to build custom tools

854
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,392
to do some of this research.

855
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,428
I think the best way I
can encourage folks here

856
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:53,398
is simply with the concept
of positive deviance.

857
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,301
If you haven't heard of the
concept of positive deviance,

858
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:57,302
very simply,

859
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,705
if you look back at most
of the significant changes

860
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:04,141
or positive events that have
occurred through history,

861
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,410
in our field or
any of the other,

862
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,644
they've been traced
back to someone

863
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,979
who was considered
a positive deviant.

864
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,681
That means a couple
simple things.

865
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,282
Number one, ask questions.

866
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,283
Ask questions of the
world around you,

867
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,353
and this applies well
beyond just threat-hunting.

868
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:17,489
Look at your SOC,
look at your data.

869
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,557
Look at how people are
interacting with your data

870
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,360
with sincere focus
on that last part.

871
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,296
Not every compromise has
the same threat actor,

872
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,801
has threat actors, has
human threat actors in it.

873
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,069
They don't all have malware.

874
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,270
They don't all have
threat intelligence.

875
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,671
They're not all
related to hunting.

876
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,441
They are all solved with humans.

877
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,077
I'm very thrilled to see that
that was the common thread

878
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,545
amongst all the talks
I've seen thus far,

879
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,413
is human at the center
of the investigation.

880
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:44,883
The human will always be the
center of the investigation

881
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,417
for as long as we're all alive,

882
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,119
and I'm certain of that.

883
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,755
So, ask questions of what you
see in the world around you.

884
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,859
When you do that, don't
complain about it.

885
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,327
It's very easy to
look at something,

886
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,262
'cause you're probably
asking questions about it

887
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,062
'cause you don't like it.

888
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,099
Don't complain about it, 'cause
complaining's not useful.

889
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,667
Instead, take that energy

890
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,702
and apply it towards
measuring something.

891
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,572
The key to doing anything
positive in life,

892
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,506
I feel a lot of the time,
is measuring something,

893
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,242
so that you can actually
see if it's a problem

894
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:12,744
and learn about that problem.

895
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,445
That's exactly what I did in
some of these scenarios here,

896
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,947
is measured something

897
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,247
to see if there's something
that can be done about it,

898
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,150
or to enhance it.

899
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,252
Once you measure
it, write about it.

900
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,789
Even if it's not something
necessarily consequential,

901
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,257
there's not a
significant finding,

902
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:28,159
write about it so that other
people can see you measured it.

903
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,160
That way, they don't
have to measure it

904
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,295
if it's not worth measuring,

905
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,496
or if you did measure it

906
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,697
and it's worth doing
something about,

907
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,033
they can also do
something about it.

908
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,734
And finally, don't
be afraid of change.

909
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,336
When I say that, I
don't mean necessarily

910
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,405
trying to change
whatever you've measured,

911
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,273
but also changing yourself.

912
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,908
If I've learned anything
through my study of the brain,

913
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,912
it's that mindsets are
incredibly quick to form

914
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,248
and entirely
resistant to change.

915
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,516
In my opinion,

916
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,984
that's one of the bigger
problems in the world

917
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,452
at scale today,

918
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,288
is that mindsets are
very resistant to change.

919
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,623
One of the things I've learned

920
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,158
to teach in my
investigation theory class,

921
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,827
where I have people go through
a lot of these simulations,

922
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:04,762
is the people who are
very new to the field,

923
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,031
they really excel in the class.

924
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,765
They really embrace the concepts

925
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,301
and they learn about
how to investigate.

926
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,604
The people who have been
doing this for a long time,

927
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,339
they really struggle.

928
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,107
That's because mindsets
are quick to form,

929
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,575
but resistant to change.

930
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,545
We have a really hard
time unwinding our brains

931
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,814
and unwinding how we
learn to do things.

932
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,649
I think if we really
wanna approach this

933
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,119
from a very
fundamental standpoint,

934
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,120
where we actually
really understand

935
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,588
our thought processes,

936
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,857
which we know, scientifically,
we know that's important,

937
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,225
it requires a little
bit of change,

938
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,561
it requires a little bit
of positive deviance.

939
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,330
(drums pounding)
