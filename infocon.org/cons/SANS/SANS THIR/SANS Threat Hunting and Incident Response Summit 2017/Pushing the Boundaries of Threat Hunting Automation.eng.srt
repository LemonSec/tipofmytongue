1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,411
(audience applauding)

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,213
- Anyway so my
name is Alex Pinto,

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,648
and this is biting into the,

4
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,550
this is one of the longest
titles I've ever done.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,652
Biting into the Jawbreaker:
Pushing the Boundaries

6
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:21,354
of Threat Hunting Automation.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,857
And the hashtag for
this talk is hamm,

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,759
with two M's and there's a
very good reason for that

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,195
that will be revealed as the
presentation goes forward.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,663
Actually the title
will also be revealed

11
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:33,967
so anyway trust me
we're gonna get there,

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,902
we're gonna get to the
other one and hopefully

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,637
this will not be a complete
waste of your time.

14
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,939
So anyway basically

15
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,975
what we're gonna be
talking here is about

16
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,209
pushing the boundaries

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,478
of threat intelligence
automation, right?

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,415
And I'm gonna address a
little bit of what Rob said

19
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:52,052
on the keynote as well
but before I get there,

20
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,554
just wanna cover, there's
gonna be four barriers

21
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,990
we're gonna be
talking about in a way

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,061
four boundaries we have to
push in order to really achieve

23
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,563
whatever this fully
automation things mean

24
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:08,701
and hopefully this is something

25
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,904
that's gonna make
sense to all of you.

26
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,873
So anyway who is this guy?

27
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,775
So I'm a security data scientist

28
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,577
and I'm a Capybara enthusiast,

29
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,513
so Capybaras are the
chilliest animals

30
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,348
in the animal kingdom,

31
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,785
I achieve to be one of

32
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,455
the nicest people in
InfoSack in the world

33
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,090
but actually David Bianco

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,925
is the nicest person in
InfoSack in the world

35
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,259
so I'm working to get there.

36
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,996
So anyway I'm a
cofounder at Niddel,

37
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,363
and I've been doing a
lot of presentations

38
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,633
under the MLSec project.

39
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,902
So the MLSec project
is a kind of community,

40
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,706
it's, think about
meetingless slack rooms

41
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,508
where people were
exchanging ideas about

42
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,277
what work and doesn't work in
machine learning for security.

43
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,449
And I'm a cofounder at Niddel
and Niddel is self named,

44
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,788
self described as an autonomous
threat hunting system.

45
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,226
And I can see a lot of
your faces curling here.

46
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,062
Which brings me to the point
of why are we having this talk?

47
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:14,233
This talk exists because Rob
Emily which is a good friend,

48
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,237
he's also in one of
the thousand slats,

49
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:20,406
he looked at the
tagline and just like

50
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,877
dude I really respect you
I think you do good work

51
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,011
but this is absurd.

52
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,579
You cannot say that.

53
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,047
People are gonna laugh
you out of the room.

54
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,384
And I'm like I'm not so
sure, I'm very fundamented,

55
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,754
I have a very clear definition
of what the automation is,

56
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,257
I have a very clear definition
of what threat hunting is,

57
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,258
what's your definition?

58
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,660
No, humans have to do it.

59
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,595
That's my definition
and I'm like

60
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,598
that sounds a little
bit self serving.

61
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,102
So can we define this
a little bit better?

62
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,105
So my job on this
presentation is

63
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm gonna try to
draw some boundaries.

64
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,042
So every time someone tells you

65
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,745
that they're automating
threat hunting,

66
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,780
or they're not automating
threat hunting,

67
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,182
you ask them to
point at the diagram

68
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,951
and say where the
bad man hurt you.

69
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,819
Which one is the barrier

70
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,721
that you're talking
about right now?

71
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,426
And I just think it just makes
this discourse so much easier

72
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,329
and I think Rob gave me
a gift in the beginning

73
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,201
because the problem that I find

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:25,370
with fully automated threat
hunting is what does fully mean,

75
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,074
what does automating mean,

76
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,376
and what does
threat hunting mean?

77
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,945
If I was to sit down
here and explain

78
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,179
what threat hunting means,

79
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,547
that would be my
whole 30 minutes,

80
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,516
so gladly we're not
gonna have to do that

81
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,319
but he used the spell
checking example.

82
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,787
We all know what
spell checking is.

83
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:45,491
In my perspective we have
fully automated spell checking.

84
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,328
There's no like imps
behind the screen

85
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,464
telling me what the
new word should be.

86
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,133
We haven't automated
remediation of spell checking,

87
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,637
if i don't want to click on
the thing to change the word,

88
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,273
it's not gonna change.

89
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,174
So I think there's a problem

90
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:06,346
between that action
and remediation maybe
on the definitions

91
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,315
but we'll get to that,
we'll get to that.

92
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,317
And I'm pretty sure Rob
on his presentations

93
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,720
will have the same Little
Bobby's comics that I have

94
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,655
by the way which
is gonna be fun.

95
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,459
So this is the threat
hunting jawbreaker.

96
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,862
And this is, when was
it, DFIR last year?

97
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,835
Anyway this is Rob Lee's
and he made it as a joke

98
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,338
because of course
perimeter of pain,

99
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,975
everybody needs to
have one of those.

100
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,378
I mean those are
very good points.

101
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,046
He puts very good points on his,

102
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,550
the things that are important
on the threat hunting.

103
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,120
But again the fully automate,

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,556
what does automate mean,
what does hunting mean?

105
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:54,060
So based on this and based
on the discussions we had

106
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,763
I pretty much said
okay I'll bite.

107
00:04:56,763 --> 00:05:00,733
So this presentation is me
biting into the jawbreaker.

108
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,037
He baited me to making this
presentation and Bianco

109
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,638
because he just wanna
watch the world burn

110
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,575
he actually accepted my
CFP to talk about this.

111
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,211
So I'm gonna defer
to him, I'm gonna get

112
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,281
one of the greatest
works that Mr. Bianco

113
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,217
has ever presented
to the community

114
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,120
and I'm gonna use it
as a point of argument

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,424
to what I'm going to do and
it's not the perimeter of pain,

116
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,560
it's actually the
hunting maturity model

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,028
that he put together.

118
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,596
By the way this is like
the first presentation

119
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,066
I didn't use a perimeter
of pain in like four years

120
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,566
so I'm recovering.

121
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,105
So yeah a maturity model.

122
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,308
Why don't we talk about
hunting as a maturity model?

123
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,545
Sorry, hunting automation
as a maturity model?

124
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,383
Because then we can be much
clearer in our descriptions

125
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,318
and when a vendor
knocks at your door,

126
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,820
I am automating hunting,

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,423
you actually have the tools
to laugh him out of the room.

128
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:01,694
And not just do finger pointing
or something like that.

129
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,564
So not to delve
too much into this

130
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,065
I would not give it justice

131
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,969
but this is the idea that
we're gonna follow here.

132
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,871
And I don't know how many of you

133
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,272
managed to go to the CTI summit,

134
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,943
there was this great
presentation by Cliff Stoll,

135
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,880
and they were handing
out these as T-shirts.

136
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,282
This is also a maxim
that I see all the time,

137
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,784
that data is not information,
information is not something,

138
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,722
something else is not whatever
the other next thing is.

139
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,558
And I think this also
ties into this maturity.

140
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,061
In a way you've
got to fully grasp

141
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,895
the first stage that you are

142
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:40,733
in order to be able to
evolve to the next one.

143
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,103
So anyway without further delay,

144
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,306
the first barrier
we have to break

145
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,710
in order to automate something
is to actually automate it.

146
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,712
So it's very appropriately
called the automation barrier.

147
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,215
So we have to do something
in an automatic way.

148
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,619
So what is the first
order of automation?

149
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,455
This has nothing to do with
Star Trek, Star Wars by the way,

150
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,825
god I almost got thrown
out of the stage right now,

151
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,060
this has nothing to
do with Star Wars,

152
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,530
the thing about the first order.

153
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,366
I was, the idea here I'm
gonna use first order,

154
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:17,736
second order, is like I
don't know how many of you,

155
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:21,908
probably not, are into math,
I know it's kinda, eh math,

156
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,145
but the idea here
is like degrees of
freedom or degrees of,

157
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,849
think about degrees of infinity

158
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,819
like how the natural
numbers are infinite

159
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,354
but if you take the
real, not the real,

160
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,056
the integral numbers,
integer numbers

161
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,927
which has negative
numbers as well,

162
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,563
it's also infinite but
it's a larger infinite.

163
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,966
Larger infinite, who cares,
well mathematicians do a lot.

164
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,634
This actually makes
a lot of difference.

165
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,803
So think about this as
like the first order,

166
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,539
the data part or that
Cliff Stoll thing

167
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,776
and when people are talking
about automating technology,

168
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,211
nine out of ten,

169
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,946
and this is a completely
made up statistic by the way,

170
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,249
think that this is
what you're doing

171
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,152
when you're automating
and that's the only
thing you can do.

172
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,622
You can write some rules, you
can check some file hashes,

173
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,191
you can have some domain names,

174
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,628
and this is definitely
the lowest possible bar.

175
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,830
If someone tells you they
are automating the hunt,

176
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,366
odds are they have somewhere
you can put a list of hashes

177
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,436
that they're gonna look
through in the machines.

178
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,570
And that pisses me off too.

179
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:26,772
That's not even close

180
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,207
to what I would consider
to be automation.

181
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,379
Any, I'm trying not to
curse on this presentation.

182
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,284
Anyone with a shell
script can do that.

183
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,987
And I'm just
automating the person

184
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,923
that's clicking the
button, the shell script,

185
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,192
that's not a very high bar.

186
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:50,329
So I would get frustrated
as well as a customer

187
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,763
if someone came to me and said

188
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,834
this is automated threat hunting
so I understand the pain.

189
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,502
So anyway let me give
you some examples

190
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,439
and this is some examples I
also used in the CTI summit

191
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,943
about the idea of
using indicator data

192
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,279
for this first
order of automation.

193
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,847
So I'm not even gonna go into

194
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,781
blocking the actual
domains you've got

195
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:14,353
but you can start
to do something,
looking at the actors,

196
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,388
the rest of the
domain, you know.

197
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,625
Maybe you don't like
Mr. Miroshichenko,

198
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,995
maybe you don't like him, right?

199
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,797
So maybe you look at
everything he registered,

200
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,632
oh yeah, looks all pretty bad,

201
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,334
doesn't look like
there's anything active,

202
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,734
it's not even domain shadowing

203
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:33,339
so he's not hijacking
someone's Go Daddy thing

204
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,341
so yeah I'm totally
gonna block this guy

205
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,679
I just automated the threat
hunting for this specific actor.

206
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,347
This is the first order thing.

207
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,117
But then as you start to
look into this technique

208
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,852
okay a lot of emails,

209
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,956
this is all Rig from October
by the way this is all like

210
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,626
stuff that really happened
in October, it was active.

211
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,429
So you can start to see okay
the emails for registrant

212
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,600
seems okay but you look at the
AS numbers, hmm, OVH, right?

213
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,202
So OVH was terrible,

214
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,641
got pretty good because of
someone who used to work there,

215
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,409
and now he left, so
everybody's betting

216
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:14,113
that's gonna be pretty
terrible soon again.

217
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,649
But should I block OVH?

218
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:20,319
The vast majority of
things coming from Rig,

219
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,320
by the way the
background here is that,

220
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,390
I don't know the
CEO got owned by Rig

221
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,324
and no more Rig or
something like that

222
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,793
so this is your mission

223
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,763
so how do you protect with
this level of tooling?

224
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,831
So ITGRAD.ru,

225
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,502
maybe if you don't have
any Russian offices, right?

226
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,773
So you lose, you
start to lose freedom,

227
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,410
you start to lose the capability

228
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,747
to effectively automate this
because there's more nuance.

229
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,752
If you look at the TLDs that
were more frequent on Rig,

230
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,186
the number one was .com, right?

231
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,789
Of course you can block .com

232
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,093
but you're gonna be looking
for a job the next day.

233
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,930
Right? So the problem
here, and this is again,

234
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,970
we don't have enough tooling
at this order of automation

235
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,373
in order to fully grasp
this is the idea of context

236
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,076
that you know what I've
been doing this for a while

237
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,011
and .com's pretty okay,

238
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,049
so I'm probably not
gonna block .com,

239
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,084
I'm gonna do
something different.

240
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,719
We just reached the
context barrier.

241
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,289
So whatever system that
you're trying to automate,

242
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,460
if it doesn't have any context
in what is normal, normal,

243
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,797
in your environment

244
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:41,901
or what's more likely or
not in other dimensions.

245
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,038
You're probably, you
probably have an issue.

246
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,275
So we had add another
order of analysis

247
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,780
which is pretty much
the context analysis.

248
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,882
And I have no idea,
is it cutting there?

249
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,219
No it's not, it's
only cutting here.

250
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,323
So the idea here is maybe we
can get statistical summaries

251
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,629
to try to get a better
idea of our internal data

252
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,134
so a lot of the lateral
movement stuff nowadays

253
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,970
which is being
delivered by UEBAs.

254
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,842
Some of them sometimes
do some good work

255
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:27,012
and a lot of that is done
through statistical analysis.

256
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,617
No you're not looking
for a signature,

257
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,218
you're not looking
for an IP address,

258
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,988
but you're looking for the
second order of context

259
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:40,159
which is oh these guys are
talking a lot amongst themselves

260
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,697
but they don't normally do that.

261
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,266
And I'm just giving
some examples here

262
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,502
of ways that you
can automate that.

263
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,935
These are all numbers
you can generate

264
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,272
so Bianco again did a great,

265
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,477
I don't know if
it was a blog post

266
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,514
or if it was something on
threathunting.net about

267
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,283
PCR, the producer
consumer ratio.

268
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,521
I'm in love with that stuff

269
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:13,259
it's a very stable metric
of behavior deviation

270
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,594
that's not sensitive
to outliers.

271
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,830
So this is a great idea,

272
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,031
he's gonna have a
presentation I think,

273
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,766
is it today or tomorrow?

274
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,300
- [David] This afternoon.

275
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,370
- This afternoon about some
other techniques you can do.

276
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,938
This is all second order stuff

277
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,139
and this is so easy to automate,

278
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,941
the example that
Tim was doing here.

279
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:31,143
It's a second order automation.

280
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,947
He's not specifically
looking for a signature

281
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,550
but he's using his
knowledge of signatures

282
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,286
in order to expand
his knowledge,

283
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,255
expand his understanding
of the things

284
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,957
that could be good or bad.

285
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:48,794
So there's a lot of different
things that you can add

286
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,797
so again at the CTI
summit I promise

287
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,434
this is the only equation,
okay, nobody panic,

288
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,904
this is the only equation I'm
gonna put on the presentation.

289
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:02,508
So I was talking about
a maliciousness ratio

290
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,679
tied to that other example,
a way for you to figure out

291
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,749
if you should care
about a TOD or an ASN

292
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,651
or something like that
as a decision point

293
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,786
for you to block or not.

294
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,591
So just count the
number of bad stuff

295
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,459
and the number of good
stuff that you have

296
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,962
maybe that's the ratio
of how much bad you know

297
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,763
in the pool of
everything that you know

298
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:25,931
and of course this varies

299
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,034
from customer to
customer as it should.

300
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,436
So whatever's normal,

301
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,405
if you have a lot of
offices in Russia,

302
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,576
going to mail.ru, it's everyday,
all the time, everyone.

303
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:44,483
If you don't, if you are
a credit union in Alabama,

304
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,554
one mail.ru hit, you can
sound the claxons Right?

305
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,125
It's all relative, it's all
relative on your context

306
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:57,096
and your understanding
of the environment.

307
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,331
I clicked, click again.

308
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,700
So again this is just some ideas

309
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,037
from that example
I was showing you

310
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,273
so the rate of all the ASNs

311
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,542
that that specific data
set I was looking at

312
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,012
was visiting was 0.6

313
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,582
so 0.6 of the entries
of badness that I had

314
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,019
versus the entries of
goodness, this is like,

315
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,756
this is almost the base
rate of how much badness

316
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,492
you usually find in a
domain, this is very,

317
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,593
this is a very like you know

318
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,497
background radiation
of the internet.

319
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,098
But then you say that ITGRAD,

320
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,303
the data that I had
collected on ITGRAD,

321
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:41,473
87% of the IP addresses there
I only had bad data about,

322
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,143
I didn't have good data about,

323
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,880
so this is telling me that
someone going to ITGRAD,

324
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,516
that ASN for that
specific environment

325
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,016
where I took this measurements

326
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:56,088
is probably almost 150 times
more likely to be a bad place.

327
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,796
Then if you was going to, I
don't know, an ASN in Google.

328
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,164
So these are numbers,

329
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,067
these are all easy to
understand numbers,

330
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,237
easy to, that you
could potentially be
using to automate,

331
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,240
sorry, that you could
potentially be using

332
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,844
to support your decision
making on hunting.

333
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,614
And this is a type
of automation.

334
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,818
Nobody here is
counting every time,

335
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,387
okay, okay Jim I need
you to run that report

336
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,854
so I want you to
open the log data

337
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,291
and I want you to write and see

338
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,894
how many good and
how many bad we have.

339
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:39,465
So we can add context
and by adding context

340
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,703
we can make our tools or
automation tools better.

341
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,272
What's the problem, right?

342
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,310
And that's our next barrier.

343
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,146
The problem is okay
ITGRAD is bad or seems bad

344
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:04,056
for these objective measure
of second order evaluation.

345
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,259
But does that mean the
whole thing is bad?

346
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,563
What if it was a really,
really reputable domain

347
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,234
that was registered
in mark monitor,

348
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:17,368
and just happened
to have an IP there,

349
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:21,240
you know, maybe one
of the CDNs messed up.

350
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,877
How do we as hunters,
we look at this data

351
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,213
that's presented to us about
a specific communication

352
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,784
or a specific data point and
we make the decision that

353
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,253
okay this is probably bad

354
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,789
because I've seen
enough stuff like this

355
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,959
or I know that this actor
is now using mark monitor

356
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,499
because anyway whatever all
the reputable registered

357
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,203
which is likely easier to hack

358
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,671
which there are a ton of them

359
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:56,108
so but and they
have been hosting,

360
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,878
I know that because I've
been looking at the data

361
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,014
so I have years of experience

362
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,482
because I have all
of those things

363
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:07,653
so I know which one of
those signals matter, right?

364
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,291
In order to make
the final conviction

365
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,927
so to speak of something
that's happening.

366
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,362
So here we are at the
experience barrier.

367
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,702
And this is pretty much what
I was telling you about,

368
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,237
how do you combine all this

369
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,140
first order or second order
signals and you make a call,

370
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,276
right, what do you
need to convict, right?

371
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,913
And the point here is
that this gut feeling

372
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,782
that I'm pretty sure all
of us in this room have

373
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,953
if we have worked more than
15 days in the threat hunting

374
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,590
actual doing threat hunting,

375
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,658
this comes from
knowledge and experience

376
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,228
and looking at past incidents

377
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:53,165
and compiling all these
lists of information of

378
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:58,102
oh this was good but they
had these bad markers,

379
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,572
this was bad but
this had this markers

380
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,774
and these markers helped
me make the decision,

381
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,543
this was good and this is
the associated information,

382
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:08,280
this was bad and this is
the associated information,

383
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,415
these are all the things
that I've learned in my time

384
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:14,418
as a hunter and this is
how I make my decisions.

385
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,958
Wow, my friends, this
sounds suspiciously like

386
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,794
supervised machine
learning to me.

387
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,500
The secret of any
machine learning model is

388
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,471
how you encode the
information, right?

389
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,642
So if I'm trying to build a
model to teleport cats and dogs,

390
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,313
I need to figure out
how am I going to tell,

391
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,516
this is not like oh
I look at the image

392
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,386
and I'm trying to
create like the script,

393
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,954
I'm trying to describe
it to a computer,

394
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,157
oh yeah cats are
fuzzy, they have fur,

395
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,725
that's not a very good one.

396
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,459
So dogs are majestic,

397
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,865
they have this
insightful look on them.

398
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,333
So that's the point,

399
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,202
whatever you feed the system

400
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,306
and however you describe
to the system, right?

401
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,907
Obviously changes

402
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:13,544
what the machine learning
is capable or not of doing,

403
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,715
so for instance if I
only had grumpy cats

404
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,485
in my sampling table,
I could write a feature

405
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,423
where all cats are grumpy,

406
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,693
so this guy is never gonna
be classified as a cat

407
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,863
because all cats are grumpy,
and if all dogs are majestic,

408
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:37,269
this guy, poor guy, I don't
even know what that is, so.

409
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,105
So if you think
of this problem as

410
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,512
you have enough signals
from your hunting,

411
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,683
if you have enough first
order and second order tools

412
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,554
and hunting aids and all
those different things

413
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,357
that you have deployed
in your environment like,

414
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,994
again, Tim just gave a
great example of a tool,

415
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,030
a focus tool, the more
focused those tools are,

416
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,500
the better they are,
this is 100% correct,

417
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,504
so that's an input on
your human decision engine

418
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,310
if you were going to convict
something or not, right?

419
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:24,016
Maybe if you can just describe
it well enough to a computer,

420
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,853
maybe a computer would
be able to do this too.

421
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,225
So this is an
example of a computer

422
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,394
doing something like that.

423
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:38,997
This specific example,

424
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:43,101
the system only knows that
the one that has a triangle,

425
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,140
that's the only data
point, the only IOC it has,

426
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,643
it knows that that was
involved in a scam.

427
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,479
But when it looked
across the board all the,

428
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,481
what it knew about the IP
addresses was resolving

429
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,451
to what it knew about who
registered the domain,

430
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,119
who didn't register the domain,

431
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,288
what were the NS systems, right?

432
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,325
It actually found
related things to it.

433
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,327
And you'll see that
it's trying to tell me

434
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,761
the second order things,

435
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,497
it's telling me there's
a low likelihood

436
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,734
that the registrant or
the register is bad,

437
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,370
it does, for it the
registered email

438
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,771
is as good as it can get,

439
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,907
it has absolutely no
information on that.

440
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,909
But it pretty much
convicts the IP address.

441
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,647
But it really, really
doesn't like the name server.

442
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,014
And why is that?

443
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,416
These are actually,

444
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,720
this is a register
that's hiding the domain,

445
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,422
it's hiding the registrant
information, right?

446
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:42,260
So trying to match those
guys by email is pointless

447
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,598
but you can easily match these
guys by the name servers.

448
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,265
So here's the thing.

449
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,338
I've just shown you something

450
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:57,209
that any threat hunter
can do very easily.

451
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,411
If it was happened to be looking

452
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,912
at those specific
number of events

453
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,116
but there's no
driver in this car.

454
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,485
This is the point
I'm trying to make.

455
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,553
It's not impressive when
you see a car making a turn

456
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,457
but if there's no driver, oh
holy shit, what's happening,

457
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,226
oh damn I cursed, ah!

458
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,964
I apologize, I apologize.

459
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,800
Anyway, and finally we
reach the final barrier

460
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,803
which I call the
Lee-Bianco barrier,

461
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,441
which you can also call
the creativity barrier

462
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,943
which is anyway, it's your call,

463
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,646
I like the Lee-Bianco
barrier better.

464
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,817
So here's the thing you
cannot make stuff up, right?

465
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:45,490
As threats evolve, as you
need new pieces of data

466
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,926
in order to make a conviction,

467
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,762
as attackers get smarter, right?

468
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,299
You're gonna get oh now I need
to look at this thing now.

469
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,336
If I don't look at this
thing I cannot fully decide

470
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:02,340
if something is, I can
convict something or not.

471
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,476
So I mean there were,
recently there were two

472
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,313
that I think of that
were interesting.

473
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,450
With the domain
fronting thing, no?

474
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,351
How many of you were
actually looking at

475
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,520
the byte counts of
the communication

476
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,023
before in your hunting process

477
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,860
before you saw the thing
about domain fronting, right?

478
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,062
How many of you on
the IDN phishing thing

479
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:27,732
were actually doing the
puny code conversion

480
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,571
on the domain that
you saw there, right?

481
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,972
To make it puny code

482
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,310
and then you could in somehow
string compare, right?

483
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,481
We are learning this as humans
as well as we see the new,

484
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,451
whatever the new threats
are and what we're doing,

485
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,919
we are writing playbooks,

486
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,922
we're writing playbooks so then
our teams can see that yeah

487
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:55,093
so we as humans on this,
above the Lee-Bianco barrier,

488
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,732
what we have to do is write
the playbooks for our team

489
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:04,202
or god forbid our
automation systems

490
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:06,705
in order for them to
be better at this.

491
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,907
So I really don't think,

492
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,543
I really think the Lee-Bianco
barrier is here to stay,

493
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,445
I don't think there is a,

494
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,746
you can transpose the
Lee-Bianco barrier,

495
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,817
even if people start to
sell you deep learning,

496
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,318
this doesn't work.

497
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,989
Okay let me be a
little bit more precise

498
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,657
about that statement.

499
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,694
So the argument would be that
convolutional neural networks

500
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,731
are very good at
finding hidden features,

501
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,500
so I don't really need to
define what I'm looking for,

502
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,536
the system will just
figure itself out.

503
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,438
The problem that nobody
tells you is that

504
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,806
convolutional neural networks

505
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,543
are only good at
environments where

506
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,979
A, you have a lot of available
data but it's not like,

507
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,484
think about data, think about
how much data you would use,

508
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:55,587
okay that's not
even nearly enough.

509
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:00,292
So and those things need to be
classified by humans, right?

510
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,028
So somebody has to go
through all those images

511
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,597
and tell that there's
a dog in the image

512
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,499
or there's a mountain
on the image.

513
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,501
Who's doing this work,
you know, you know,

514
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,969
you guys know who's
doing this work,

515
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,239
we are all doing this work
for Google when we do captcha.

516
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,707
This is what we're
doing for them.

517
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,143
We're the humans clicking on

518
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,712
here there's a dog on
this picture, right?

519
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,881
But you know what, so cool.

520
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,884
We all know what
a dog looks like.

521
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,853
It's a very evenly
distributed scale, right?

522
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,623
Almost every one in the world
knows what a dog looks like

523
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,858
so they will be able
to click correctly.

524
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,861
How many people in this
room, you don't have to,

525
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,331
please don't tell them

526
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,700
because I don't want
a fight to break out,

527
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,268
how many people in this room

528
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,905
do you trust to classify
an event correctly?

529
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,473
Ask yourselves that.

530
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,741
I trust Bianco.

531
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,178
But that's the thing.

532
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,747
This is why it doesn't work.

533
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,550
This is why anything
that you would put like

534
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,620
oh yeah I'm just gonna
have the analysts classify

535
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,023
the tickets and then it
will train them auto.

536
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,292
Dude have you ever run a sock?

537
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,463
Are you gonna put a like a okay
guys your mission for this,

538
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,131
your goal this month is gonna be

539
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:18,303
how many tickets you can close
and classify correctly. Dude.

540
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,108
Anyway if anybody
says deep learning,

541
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,010
go away, that's my tip.

542
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,713
So I wanna talk about HAMM.

543
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,954
So HAMM is the
hunting automation
maturity model, right?

544
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:39,724
And this is what, this
is what we want to,

545
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,493
this is the thing that,

546
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,561
I mean I don't know if you
guys are gonna like it or not,

547
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,964
it's fair, but at least
it's how I'm gonna,

548
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,099
if somebody comes to me,
oh you can't fully automate

549
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,934
I'm gonna like
okay point at the,

550
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,370
please point at
the diagram, right?

551
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,104
So anyway, here's Hamm,

552
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,875
okay no sorry, not
this one, not this one.

553
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,810
So here is HAMM, right?

554
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,580
I'm not gonna read
what's on the side,

555
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,349
it's just that you
know if you guys wanna

556
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,553
just one slide that pretty
much has everything,

557
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,988
this is pretty much it.

558
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,491
And I'm putting the human domain
there on the fourth order,

559
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,860
which is the ability to create

560
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,562
completely new detection things

561
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,798
that doesn't exist

562
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,167
but if you guys have
been paying attention,

563
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,602
even the second order
descriptions I was doing

564
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:30,008
is way ahead of any signature
based matching today.

565
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,177
It's where all the UEBA vendors,

566
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,846
do we have any UEBA vendors
here in the audience?

567
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,781
There should be a couple,
there should be a few,

568
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,717
okay I apologize to all
the rest but UEBA guys

569
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,885
you can now just say

570
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,554
you are automating
threat hunting as well,

571
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,656
just do that, just
tell your sales guys.

572
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,827
So, so to try to conflate
automated threat hunting

573
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,565
with variety signatures
is misguided.

574
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,036
There's so much more we
can do and I think I've,

575
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:02,140
I'm trying to build out the
case of the different layers

576
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,776
where you can look
at this problem,

577
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,079
the different ways you can
organize and almost obviously

578
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,448
trying to anchor that
into our human experience.

579
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:15,019
If we're not trying to do the
work a good human would do,

580
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,589
what the hell are
we going to do?

581
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,524
So I have an alternate,

582
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,660
I have an alternate
representation of HAMM,

583
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:27,132
maybe some of you
guys will be more,

584
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:31,302
you like this one better, so
this is also HAMM, okay, so...

585
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,740
So on the final level,

586
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,344
if you're not Rob
Lee or David Bianco

587
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,112
you're probably screwed, right?

588
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,848
So show of hands, how many
of you here in the audience

589
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,985
are either Rob, Lee, either
one's fine, or David Bianco?

590
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,890
I count two, I don't
see Lee or Rob so yeah

591
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,558
so there may be 200 people,

592
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,727
so less than 1% of this room

593
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,029
is actually operating on
the fourth level right now,

594
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,366
this is not good, we
need to work harder.

595
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,635
So finally just to cap off,

596
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,305
if we're going to be picky about

597
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,742
automation and threat hunting,

598
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:14,412
I mean I'm happy to
choose another name.

599
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:16,347
I mean I like threat farming,

600
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,450
I think threat farming is funny,

601
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,319
because instead of you
going down and hunting

602
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,553
you're just like
growing your crops

603
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,455
and then the
threats come to you.

604
00:30:24,455 --> 00:30:25,622
It sounds a little bit like

605
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,425
oh wait I'm creating
my own threats

606
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,661
so it's kind of
cognitively weird,

607
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,098
but I'm happy to pick
another name, it's fine,

608
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,769
but you cannot tell me that
those ideas and those processes

609
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:39,204
that I just described

610
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:43,174
are not what we all commonly
call threat hunting.

611
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,177
(suspenseful drums)
