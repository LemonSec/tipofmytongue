1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,869
(chords ringing)

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,310
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,911
- For those of you
who don't know me,

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,580
I'm Rob.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,482
That's my stuff.

6
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,550
Basically the only thing
that's important up there

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,852
is I write comics.

8
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,353
So those are pretty sweet.

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,356
But I also do some of the
cyber things out there.

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,592
I have the CTI course
that I authored.

11
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,560
And so how many of you are
in my CTI course this week

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,994
by the way?

13
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,064
Yeah, looking around
gotta, all right perfect.

14
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,499
So I got the CTI course

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,634
and then I've got the Incident
Response course for ICS.

16
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:36,603
It's kind of like a hunting
incident response course

17
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,971
for ICS that I do.

18
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,471
A little bit about
my background.

19
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,341
So I started off
as an Air Force guy

20
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,544
and went over to the
intelligence community.

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
And when I got there they said,

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,748
"Here's your team, now
we want you to do stuff."

23
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,251
And I started off and said,
"Cool, what's my requirements?

24
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,318
"What am I supposed to do?"

25
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:57,757
And the feedback I got was
find the unknown unknowns.

26
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:59,826
I'm like what does
that actually mean?

27
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,661
And they're like,
"You'll figure it out."

28
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,364
Which is a horrible tasking.

29
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,466
But what I ended up
saying is you know what

30
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,833
I like control systems.

31
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,269
Control systems are sweet.

32
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,770
I'll focus on control systems.

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,705
And I generated
my hypothesis that

34
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,408
new nation state teams

35
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,377
that the intelligence
community wasn't tracking

36
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,312
could probably be found
targeting control systems.

37
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,482
I figured if you're
a cool nation state

38
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,517
doing cool offensive stuff,

39
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:27,053
at some point you're
gonna overlap with

40
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,455
industrial control
system environments

41
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,456
like power grid,

42
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,323
water infrastructure,

43
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,523
oil gas.

44
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,560
I bet we could find
some sweet stuff there.

45
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,428
And that ended up
leading us to finding

46
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,598
new quote unquote "APT threats"

47
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,866
that the intelligence community

48
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,334
had never been tracking before.

49
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,303
Nation states that we
didn't even think were

50
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:45,972
to the brink of doing
these type operations

51
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,806
were operating
these environments.

52
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:50,243
And that in essence
was a mix of a hunting

53
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,777
and an intel focus.

54
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,814
And so I'll talk from my
perspective in this presentation

55
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,750
basically about that
kind of material.

56
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,586
So let's talk about
the three takeaways.

57
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,654
And you'll notice I put a
lot of Little Bobby comics

58
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,189
in my slides.

59
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,625
I usually like explaining
things to large audiences

60
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,994
in small, condensed,
three pane comics.

61
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,762
I feel it goes well.

62
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,431
Down there at the bottom
we're just talking about

63
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,932
the CTI Jedi Council

64
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,801
which sounds like a joke.

65
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,369
But we arrogant few

66
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,472
actually created that group.

67
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,107
And so Rebecca and Sergio,

68
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,809
and all the folks that
are here this week,

69
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,412
we have this group and that's
where this talk spawned.

70
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,849
Alex Pento and I got in a
little bit of a heated exchange

71
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,351
about automation when it
comes to threat hunting.

72
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,421
And my position was very,
very straightforward.

73
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,923
You can't do it.

74
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,558
You should leverage automation.

75
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,060
Every smart hunter
leverages automation.

76
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,363
But automating the entirety of

77
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,965
the Hunting Maturity
Model is not gonna happen.

78
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,467
And you can't,

79
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,302
and we see a lot
of filth and hype

80
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,805
and sort of rhetoric in the
community about don't worry,

81
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,341
my AI magic solution
will take care

82
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,543
of everything on the network.

83
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,478
We've got human threats.

84
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,846
We need human defenders.

85
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,182
We want a defensible
environment with all that stuff.

86
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,617
But it's human v human.

87
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,251
Of course, if there is
anybody in the community

88
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,353
who would figure it out,

89
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,855
it would be Alex.

90
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,523
Him and his company are
doing some amazing things.

91
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,759
But that's the
nexus of this talk.

92
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,560
That's what I'll
talk about today.

93
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,897
So, I won't bore you with
the 20 minute version

94
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,899
because obviously you
all know what this is.

95
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,301
I just thought it'd be sweet

96
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,969
to look at a historical view.

97
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,406
I skipped Alex's
presentation so that I won't

98
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,908
biasedly talk to things
that he did or didn't.

99
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,577
So I don't know if he
covered any of this.

100
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,345
But when we talk
about threat hunting,

101
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,348
a lot of people miss out
where it actually started.

102
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,517
And I thought just one
slide on the history of it

103
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:38,851
would be fun.

104
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,621
Early 2000s is when
we started seeing that

105
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,223
threat hunting term pop up.

106
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,857
Richard Bejtlich wrote
a great blog post there,

107
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:45,858
I have a reference
at the bottom,

108
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,594
that goes over this.

109
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,429
And actually one of
the first articles

110
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,863
in the community on it

111
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:53,967
was 2011 in Information
Security magazine.

112
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,035
Not cyber warrior extreme,

113
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,270
or cyber cyber cyber stuff,

114
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,571
but Information Security.

115
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,273
It's almost as good as
like Sys Admin Weekly.

116
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,374
So, anyways.

117
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,977
Information Security magazine,

118
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,145
he wrote this article saying,

119
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,948
we're doing hunting
in the GE CERT

120
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,451
based off of what we were
doing in the AF CERT,

121
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,386
the Air Force Computer
Emergency Response Team.

122
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,654
That's actually where
a lot of it came from.

123
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,224
It kind of dual came out
of the NSA and AF CERT

124
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,459
around the same time.

125
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,827
Can't figure out
which one actually

126
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,495
came up with the term first.

127
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:23,963
But back in the early 2000s,

128
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,598
people focusing on that
dedicated hunting approach.

129
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,100
Thought that was cool.

130
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,736
A little bit of hat tips
where that term came from.

131
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,105
But to lead into this
discussion I'll note

132
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:36,009
that everything about
hunting from the beginning

133
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,910
before any marketing
and buzz terms,

134
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,080
every bit of it was
focused on humans

135
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,984
looking into their
networks past automation.

136
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,787
So whatever IDS is, and AV,
and everything was catching,

137
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,255
that's all the automation stuff.

138
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,991
Looking past wherever the
automation was getting to them

139
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,558
and going on hunting trips

140
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,362
to look for things that
weren't getting caught.

141
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,731
It was the whole
nexus of the term.

142
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,134
So why can't it
fully be automated?

143
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,303
This is my comic for Alex.

144
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,937
So I've got Little Bobby here.

145
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,139
And Matt runs up
to him and says,

146
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,307
"Little Bobby, what
are you doing?"

147
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,908
He's like, "'Hunting threats.'

148
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,477
"'Well threat hunting does
require the human focus

149
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,780
"'but more with forensics
and security automation

150
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,782
"'than bows and arrows.'"

151
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,582
And Little Bobby looks
very upset and says,

152
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,986
"Well, I can still fully
automate this right?"

153
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,989
And he goes, "Nah,
maybe removing the
human would be wrong."

154
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,792
So, again I'm a big fan of
keeping that human in the loop.

155
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,561
And I would note,

156
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,796
for those of you that
come up with the mindset

157
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,500
that human focus is the
one percenters, right.

158
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,402
Only the one percent
can do hunting.

159
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,837
I would disagree.

160
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,272
I think there's definitely
some of those people

161
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,973
that are just rock stars
and doing cool stuff.

162
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,242
David Bianco's obviously
been referenced

163
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,645
probably in every
presentation here this week.

164
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,847
But I very, very
much believe that

165
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,084
any of the community
that goes forward

166
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,186
and just does something
a little bit more

167
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,721
than their day to day job

168
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,955
and says you know what,

169
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,690
I'm gonna open up
Wireshark or Snort.

170
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,925
I don't care what it is.

171
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,093
Doesn't have to be
your fancy tool.

172
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,627
But anything where they say

173
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,896
I'm gonna go a
little bit further.

174
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,665
That's the one percent
of the community.

175
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,367
The people that go
past eight to five

176
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,369
just to say I'm gonna do
something a little bit more.

177
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,504
I mean, my entire career
has been inspired by

178
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,039
people like that.

179
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,306
The reason I'm here today
is 'cause of those people

180
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,175
that wanted to go just
a little bit more.

181
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,377
And I thought they were awesome,

182
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,344
and I thought we were
doing cool things,

183
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,879
and it inspired me.

184
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,282
So, it doesn't have to lead
to the discovery of the APT.

185
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,818
It can just be a focus of trying
to be a little bit better.

186
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,821
So that's what I
want to talk about.

187
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,090
For anybody that's seen anything
I've ever presented before,

188
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,657
you've probably seen
me throw this at you.

189
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,128
The sliding scale
of cyber security.

190
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,695
The whole focus here,

191
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,131
and I won't bore you
to death with it,

192
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,965
but the whole focus is
there's different categories

193
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,101
of things you can
do for security.

194
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,836
I wrote it specifically because

195
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,706
I operate not only
with technical folks,

196
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,941
and leading my company
in doing cool stuff

197
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,544
in ICS environments and
SANS courses and all that,

198
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,080
but I also work
over at New America,

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,416
which is a think tank
with policy folks,

200
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,885
and I get to play with
congress critters all day,

201
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,486
and like meeting all these
congressional members

202
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,921
and their staffers,

203
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,790
their view of security
versus our view of security.

204
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,591
It's very interestingly
different.

205
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,460
And it always boggles
me when I ask people

206
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,760
what do you do?

207
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,363
They're like, "I
do cyber security."

208
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,731
Like, what does that mean?

209
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,965
That's not a thing.

210
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,034
What do you actually do
on a day to day basis?

211
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,905
So I said, here's the five
categories you can focus on.

212
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,940
What's most relevant here is

213
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,210
offense is a horrible
return on investment,

214
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,611
and getting it right from
the start with architecture

215
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,314
is a great return on investment.

216
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,016
So you basically have
this sliding approach

217
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,018
that as we learn and do things,

218
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,753
we should be driving
as much as possible

219
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,755
to that left hand
side of the scale.

220
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,190
We should be trying
to figure out

221
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,358
how to make and build better
systems to start with.

222
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,027
So to me, when I
talk about hunting,

223
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,829
I'm talking about
active defense.

224
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,530
Humans involved.

225
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,532
You've got all your tools,
and your architecture,

226
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,234
and your sensors, and sims,

227
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,168
and whatever else.

228
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:50,636
That's all your passive defense.

229
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,505
It's technology on the
environment doing stuff

230
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,940
without human interaction.

231
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,341
But the active defense,

232
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,344
the human focus
is human v human.

233
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,580
We want good architecture
and passive defense

234
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,448
so it's a defensible
environment.

235
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,217
But what takes a
defensible environment

236
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,818
and makes it defended
is only the human.

237
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,455
So when I talk about
threat hunting,

238
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,491
I put it in that
active events category.

239
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,526
By my own way of
looking at the world,

240
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,194
which is not necessarily yours,

241
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:16,963
but my own way of
looking at the world,

242
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,265
if you automate it completely,

243
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,167
you move it to a
passive defense.

244
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,835
That's the point,
that's awesome.

245
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,637
The more that Alex
and people like him

246
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,472
can focus on
returning automation

247
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,541
and driving it back to the
left hand side of the scale,

248
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,810
the more we're gonna get
out of that investment.

249
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,010
That's awesome.

250
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,813
But by its very core,
the human process,

251
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,914
that's the hunting focus.

252
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,283
Obviously you've seen this.

253
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,451
I just kind of had
to throw it in there.

254
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,685
What I did want to note though

255
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,152
is down at that bottom,

256
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,789
for those of you who are
brand new to the community,

257
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,824
and you're like yeah I've
heard this term all week.

258
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,127
David Bianco and I
published a SANS paper,

259
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,328
and it's down at the bottom,

260
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,295
on the who, what, where,

261
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,198
why, and when of threat hunting.

262
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,665
What's all the stuff you
need to know about it

263
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,868
and understand sort
of where to go.

264
00:08:55,868 --> 00:09:00,172
So that's a good approach
if you're interested.

265
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,976
Also, here's my manger
defense to Alex.

266
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,546
Quoting Sergio is
always bonus points

267
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,080
for anybody in the
community by the way.

268
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,582
Anybody that's been in
the community long enough

269
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,384
is usually doing something
based off of what Sergio

270
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,119
wrote at one point in his life,

271
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,921
which is almost
depressing and exciting

272
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,422
all at the same time.

273
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,224
So I loved this when he said,

274
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,525
"Look, it can't be
fully automatic.

275
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,593
"Otherwise we'd just
call it an IDS."

276
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,564
And that to me is the
easiest way to sum it up.

277
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,266
It's amazing if it's automatic.

278
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,803
But hunting by its core is
the extent of automation,

279
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,973
exhausted and I'm going a
little bit step further.

280
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,641
So what does that mean to me?

281
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,712
And this gets back to what
I coined as the jawbreaker.

282
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,681
I mainly did it as
a joke at first.

283
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,316
I have to be honest with you.

284
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,953
David Bianco has his like
pyramid of pain thing going on.

285
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,254
And I'm like yeah,
that's awesome.

286
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,389
How do I do something
entirely stupid too?

287
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,924
I was like jawbreaker.

288
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,693
Jawbreaker would
be really cheesy.

289
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,194
That sounds awesome.

290
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,228
So I created it and then
people ended up liking it

291
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,164
and using it.

292
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,365
I was like, oh crap,

293
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,333
now I've actually
gotta make it useful.

294
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,300
So here it is.

295
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,834
Here's the useful version.

296
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,172
And this is what I think Alex
was referring to this morning

297
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,541
with the whole biting
the jawbreaker.

298
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,710
These are the things
in my opinion,

299
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,612
if you're talking about hunting,

300
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,514
you need to have as sort of
core tenets in your mind.

301
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,550
Number one, threat
hunting requires the focus

302
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,483
to be on people.

303
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,086
Obviously that's my big opinion.

304
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,321
That's the whole point of we're
not gonna automate if fully.

305
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,023
But number two,

306
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,692
your job focuses on
human adversaries,

307
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:30,429
but you may not
encounter adversaries.

308
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,799
That is really hard for people
to get their minds around.

309
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,167
It sounds like a really
trivial statement.

310
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,169
But let me explore
it a little bit.

311
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,206
I'm usually a very ADD,
kind of tangent storyteller,

312
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,074
so I'll break away
from this for a second

313
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,944
and tell a story that
brings up the point.

314
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,579
I was in the US
intelligence community,

315
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,283
stationed in Germany in the
era of the Snowden leaks.

316
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,119
What a fun time to be alive.

317
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:53,953
So in my,

318
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,056
working in this
intelligence agency,

319
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,624
you take your pick
which one it is,

320
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,459
in Germany, got all these people

321
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,893
that have known
me for years there

322
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,596
and I've always told them hey,

323
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,797
I'm US intelligence community.

324
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,931
That way you don't have
to associate with me

325
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,433
if you don't want to.

326
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,001
But if you do I'm gonna hang
out in these hackerspaces.

327
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,670
And I'd go teach
and I've have fun.

328
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,838
And I would
constantly go to CCC,

329
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,140
the Chaos Computer Congress.

330
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,941
Wonderful, amazing people there.

331
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,209
But after the Snowden leaks,

332
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,813
we saw a bunch of
influx of those people.

333
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,649
The you're spying
on me all the time

334
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,117
and oh my gosh my
life is ruined,

335
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,853
tinfoil hat kind
of wearing people.

336
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,522
Anyways, so because
they knew who I was,

337
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,358
I would consistently get
people coming up to me

338
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,926
and were like, "I know
you're spying on me."

339
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,295
I'm like what?

340
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,865
"Like, I know you
are spying on me."

341
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,001
Dude, I have three
easy questions

342
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,602
that can solve this right now.

343
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,737
Number one,

344
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,939
do you run operations against

345
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,641
industrial control system
environments around the world?

346
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,910
Like, "What?"

347
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,578
Do you attack ICS
infrastructure.

348
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,411
No, cool.

349
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,316
Do you research nuclear weapons

350
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,752
with the intent of
blowing up people.

351
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,286
"What, no, God no."

352
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,656
Cool, number three.

353
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,324
Do you hang out with terrorists?

354
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,392
Not like friends of
friends of friends,

355
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,361
but like tea time
with terrorists.

356
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,696
And they're like, "No."

357
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,531
I'm like, "Then I
don't care about you."

358
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,301
Okay, like your not
important in my life.

359
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,437
Going back to the
adversary discussion,

360
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,873
the downfall of all
of this hunting stuff

361
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,008
is you could spend a
whole lot of money,

362
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,710
do a lot of cool, fancy things,

363
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,579
spin up the best
team in the world

364
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,080
and be stupidly bored.

365
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,883
You might not get targeted.

366
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,651
You might not be
important to an adversary.

367
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,019
And that's hard for everybody

368
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,488
to get wrapped
around their mind.

369
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,857
'Cause everybody likes to
think you're super important.

370
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,592
Like, yeah I'd
totally get targeted.

371
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,127
That's a weird thing by the way.

372
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,995
But a lot of people
have this view of

373
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,797
of course the ATP
is coming after me.

374
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,998
Maybe not, dude.

375
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:47,700
Understand your risk profile,

376
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,568
what makes sense in investment
in your organization

377
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,337
to mitigate that
risk and go forward.

378
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:54,372
For some people, it's a really
experienced hunting team.

379
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,542
For some people,
patch your systems.

380
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,676
You know, there's a balance.

381
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,879
So, number three.

382
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,081
You need the open
mindedness of a new person,

383
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,183
but hunting is not
for new people.

384
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,154
And although I said we want
everybody to do cool stuff,

385
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,623
and I do think that
everybody can hunt,

386
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,926
if you're gonna have somebody
in a position to do hunting,

387
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,795
like an actual dedicated focus,

388
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,930
I think it is entirely
wrong to put a new person

389
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,332
in that position.

390
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,168
I don't think it's beneficial
to their development.

391
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,303
Go focus on something first.

392
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,571
Malware reverse engineering,

393
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,672
network analysis,

394
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,808
go learn policy for all I care.

395
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,777
Do something cool that
you get hyped up about.

396
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,712
Then bring that talent in

397
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,948
and operate as if
you are a new person.

398
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,284
Open mindedness
to ask questions.

399
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,286
One of the best
operators I ever had

400
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,954
was this young Marine.

401
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,223
And we had all these
wonderful people on my team.

402
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,458
We had 30 really,
really sharp folks

403
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,959
in the intelligence community.

404
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,462
And this one young Marine
would consistently just ask

405
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,531
the stupid questions that
nobody wanted to ask.

406
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,166
And it would lead us to
these beautiful discoveries.

407
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,102
And I also liked him because
when I told my Air Force guys

408
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,637
like hey, I want
you to find China.

409
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,872
I was like what would China
do and think and whatever.

410
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,842
I'd be like Marine, find China.

411
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,009
Control Alt kill sir.

412
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,877
I'm like yeah, good.

413
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,145
All right so.

414
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,847
Sometimes you need a
little bit of focus.

415
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,249
But asking questions
is also good.

416
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,084
The other thing I'll note
is that product vendors

417
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,651
will pitch you hunting,

418
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,154
but it's not about the product.

419
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,056
And I know this one
sits a little bit weird

420
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,757
at this event with
all the vendor booths.

421
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,559
So, let me say this nicely.

422
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,627
I am a dirty vendor.

423
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,296
I have a technology product.

424
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,166
Not pitched to any of you
guys because I focus in ICS

425
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,468
but I'm a dirty vendor too.

426
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,938
And with that I will say,
it's not about vendors.

427
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,007
It's completely about people.

428
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,575
Do we want cool tools
to do cool things?

429
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,479
Absolutely, but if I was
gonna spend one dollar

430
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,780
and what percentage
of that dollar

431
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,048
would be focused on people?

432
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,250
All of it.

433
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,718
I would figure out
the technology later.

434
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,952
No matter where I go,

435
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,487
no matter how many
companies I see,

436
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,954
ho many people I teach,

437
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,791
the singular complaint I
always get is human focused.

438
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,326
Nobody comes to
my class and goes,

439
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,862
"I really hate QRadar and I
want to use QRadar better."

440
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,430
I'm like what do you
actually want to do?

441
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh my management sucks.

442
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,967
That's the one I always get.

443
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,401
My manager sucks.

444
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,105
Or I don't know what I'm
doing and I want to do better.

445
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,606
I prefer the latter

446
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,109
because by the number of
people I've heard tell me

447
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,310
my manager sucks,

448
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,877
and it's the entire industry,

449
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,381
like somebody's not being
honest with themselves.

450
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,983
Not all the managers can suck.

451
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,450
Some of you apparently
are just maybe

452
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,619
coming up a little short.

453
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,854
But either way,

454
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,455
you need to rely on automation,

455
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,624
but you can't fully automate it.

456
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,293
Again, the whole
point of my talk.

457
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,828
If you're not using
automation in today's world,

458
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,730
you're doing it wrong, period.

459
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,865
And I guarantee you are,

460
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,366
even if you don't realize it.

461
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,936
And like David talked about in
the Hunting Maternity Model,

462
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,871
move it across just
like Alex hit on.

463
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,739
I really like the whole

464
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,508
let's try to move
the model along

465
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,944
to make sure that we're
using automation effectively.

466
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,478
Like, rock on, everybody
can get around that.

467
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,582
But be careful with what
you're teaching your systems.

468
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,184
Be careful with what you're
teaching your people.

469
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,319
Am I teaching my new analysts
as they come on the team

470
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,355
that don't worry, the
box is gonna tell you

471
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,423
when something is wrong,

472
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,024
and I want you to respond to it.

473
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:02,194
Well, they're always
gonna be tied to that box.

474
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,896
And they're never
going to progress.

475
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,966
Or do I want to say go figure
out the science behind this

476
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
and then use the cool tools.

477
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,336
When I stand up teams,

478
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,437
or I had to stand
up the Dragos team,

479
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,271
I as like hey cool.

480
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,472
Congratulations guys.

481
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,906
I'm gonna hire a
bunch of fun people.

482
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,941
You get no budget.

483
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,009
Like, what?

484
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,277
Like, nothing.

485
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,545
I want you to use
open source tools.

486
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,913
I want you to use
open source feeds.

487
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,147
I want you to use
everything that requires you

488
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,782
to learn about the community.

489
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:26,118
Then when you can make
the justification later on

490
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,420
of what you actually
want to do, go do it.

491
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,621
Go buy the product.

492
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,090
Because if you just
go to a vendor,

493
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,458
and I get this question all
the time from customers.

494
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,358
Like, "Cool

495
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,830
"does your product
do these things?"

496
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,666
Yes, awesome, good
targeted question.

497
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,167
Or is it the reverse?

498
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,669
"What does your product do?"

499
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,006
It makes you milkshakes and
gets you presents on Christmas.

500
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,140
Man, it'll do whatever you want.

501
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,375
Sign the check.

502
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,309
Like, if you ask
a product vendor,

503
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,209
no matter how good they are,

504
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,444
are you amazing?

505
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,579
They're gonna come
back and be like

506
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,147
"I'm so stupid amazing,
it's ridiculous.

507
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,449
"You should buy my product."

508
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,784
Come in with targeted questions

509
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,286
based on doing it
without fancy tools.

510
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,888
Cool, so let's get into
the ICS case studies,

511
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,156
which I find to be more fun.

512
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,358
First part of the
talk is very much

513
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,960
you can't automate
hunting fully.

514
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,062
And I'm happy to have any
sort of debates with people.

515
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,231
But I think just on the
nexus of what that term is,

516
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,665
you cannot do it.

517
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,002
But the case studies are
what I find to be really fun.

518
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,904
So I like industrial
control system environments.

519
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,472
It tends to be my passion.

520
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,040
I mentioned this,

521
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,708
same thing at the CTI Summit.

522
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,445
But I don't really
care sometimes

523
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,182
when students are like I lost
another 10,000 credit cards.

524
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm like that's cool man.

525
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,185
It sucks, you'll get over it.

526
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,953
Like I really care
about power being there,

527
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,488
oil and gas pumping,

528
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,090
water being available
in the community.

529
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,259
I get really jazzed
up about ICS.

530
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,262
And nothing is
more exciting to me

531
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,364
than one, educating people.

532
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,565
I love that.

533
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,701
Or two, really screwing
up an asshole's day.

534
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,503
Like that is so much fun.

535
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,306
So I love hunting
in ICS environments

536
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,974
because we deal with
the types of threats

537
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,010
that are like national
level programs

538
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,511
of I need this capability

539
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,580
to be able to turn off the
power for wartime scenario,

540
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,880
and wherever else.

541
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,917
Awesome, I love denying
that capability.

542
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,019
That just feels super exciting.

543
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,588
And I love hunting
that's trivial.

544
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,391
The more basic your
hunting hypothesis is,

545
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,559
and still works,

546
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,194
the more excited I get.

547
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,462
Like I will tell you

548
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,696
before you even get
to the case studies,

549
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:18,930
my favorite thing in
the world to look for,

550
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,366
going into an ICS
environment is Bing.

551
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,068
Bing.com, why?

552
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,203
Because nobody uses Bing.

553
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,604
All right, like nobody.

554
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,039
(audience laughing)

555
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,407
So when I go into an industrial
control system environment

556
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,375
that's supposed to be
disconnected from the internet,

557
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,010
guess what, I
shouldn't see Bing,

558
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,379
I shouldn't see Microsoft
Windows downloader update,

559
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,680
you know updates.com,

560
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,149
any of that crap.

561
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,450
But what happens is I see
internet checking for malware

562
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,153
before they connect up to
command and control servers

563
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,888
and go oh that one's infected.

564
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,724
Or an electric utility
we were in recently.

565
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,695
There was a call out to an
NTP server at Microsoft.com.

566
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,230
That seems completely legit.

567
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,931
Calling out for
Network Time Protocol

568
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,166
from Microsoft.com.

569
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,667
Problem one,

570
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,503
probably wouldn't be
reaching out to the internet.

571
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,870
Problem two,

572
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,372
the bigger problem,

573
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:03,575
is because there were such
time sensitive systems,

574
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:05,744
don't rely on
external NTP servers.

575
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,279
Rely on GPS.

576
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,882
So anybody doing a Network
Time Protocol query

577
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,217
from a sensitive environment
like electric utility,

578
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,318
that's wrong.

579
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,586
And it was malware on the system

580
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,321
just trying to figure
out how to connect up.

581
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,255
So, cool stuff.

582
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,757
Let's talk about case studies.

583
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,359
To get into case studies

584
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,095
and to understand a little bit
of the difference to an ICS.

585
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,429
I've done a paper on this.

586
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:25,931
You can go research it.

587
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,767
I'm gonna give you the two
second Little Bobby version.

588
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,670
The kill chain, useful tool.

589
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,273
Lockheed marketing has really

590
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,274
made it interesting for
folks to use the kill chain

591
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,843
with a straight face.

592
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,179
But it's great about
putting data into buckets

593
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,681
and being able to analyze
adversary patterns over time.

594
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,515
That's the whole point.

595
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,750
Not predictive anything.

596
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,585
It's just about being
able to observe patterns

597
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,587
across different schemas.

598
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,155
It still works at an ICS,

599
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,723
but it's only stage one.

600
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,158
So in an ICS attack,

601
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,825
the types of attacks
we're worried about most.

602
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,728
Power going out,
water stopping, etc.

603
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,463
That's just stage one.

604
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,465
What ultimately happens
is the adversaries

605
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,167
have to pivot to stage two.

606
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,702
They do the actions
and objectives

607
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,137
and things they need
in the environment

608
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,572
to glean off knowledge

609
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,573
of the industrial control
system environments.

610
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,976
And they say, "Hm,
engineering drawings,

611
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,045
"schematics, PLC layouts.

612
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,413
"These are all cool things.

613
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,216
"Now I know how this
system operates."

614
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,251
And the substation
in New Orleans

615
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,653
is way different than
a substation in Biloxi.

616
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,155
There's not a lot
of commonality.

617
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,024
So it really is a focused
effort by the adversary.

618
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,427
So then, they'll have
to develop something,

619
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,230
either knowledge or a
capability like malware.

620
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,698
They have to test it out.

621
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,266
Why do I assume they
have to test it out?

622
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,400
This is an axiom I have.

623
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,202
It's an accepted assumption.

624
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,071
The reason I say they're
going to test it out

625
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,773
is because no smart adversary.

626
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,308
Not all your
adversaries are smart,

627
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,509
I've met some of 'em.

628
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,278
They're, you know, whatever.

629
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:50,582
Anyways, any smart adversary
running a multi-million dollar

630
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,417
operation over months or years

631
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,019
is not gonna
develop a capability

632
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,454
and launch it at you going

633
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,255
I hope this works, click.

634
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,424
You know, you're actually
gonna do some level of testing.

635
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,059
And then delivery, install,

636
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,494
and execute of
the actual attack.

637
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,029
Interesting thing in ICS

638
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,632
is it's actually likely
not to be malware.

639
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,033
It can.

640
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,834
But more of the
scenarios we're seeing

641
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:13,305
is adversaries learning the
ICS to use it against itself.

642
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,807
If the system can take
down power itself,

643
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,409
why don't I just learn
how to use the system

644
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,378
and use it to take down power?

645
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,912
So that's what happened
in the Ukraine.

646
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,115
For those of you that
are uninitiated into ICS

647
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,383
and want to learn
a lot about ICS,

648
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,617
I wrote a paper.

649
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,319
I was one of the
lead investigators

650
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,455
for the Ukraine
cyber attack in 2015.

651
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,957
An adversary, maybe
Russian, maybe not.

652
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,827
An adversary broke
into Oblenergo's

653
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,730
energy companies in Ukraine,

654
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,166
and for the first time in
history took down power

655
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,833
as a result from cyber attack.

656
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:43,902
That's pretty cool.

657
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,304
So we detailed the entire attack

658
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,538
and all the things that happened

659
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,607
and structured along
that kill chain.

660
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,311
The reason I highlight it
ahead of the case studies

661
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,879
is because if you want
to generate hypotheses,

662
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,049
and this is what I'm going
to focus the last portion,

663
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,084
the big portion of my talk on.

664
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,654
If you want to focus on
hypothesis generation,

665
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,790
which is the core of hunting,

666
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,992
coming up with a good
hypothesis you're going to test,

667
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,629
you must have expertise at
some point in your career

668
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,267
on the systems you're
touching, period.

669
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,402
Why do I not think
the IT security folks

670
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,504
coming into the ICS are
gonna do a good job?

671
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,039
'Cause they don't
understand the systems.

672
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,941
And a well intentioned
IT security person

673
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,010
is more harmful to an ICS

674
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,446
than Russia, China, and
Iran combined, okay.

675
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,749
I need people to have
expertise on sensitive systems,

676
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,118
especially if they hope
to hunt for adversaries.

677
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,352
Why?

678
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,454
'Cause the adversaries
have spent the time

679
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,687
learning those systems.

680
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,956
And if you want to
have a playing field

681
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,457
that's anywhere close to equal,

682
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,992
you have to do the same.

683
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,928
So understanding how those
attacks work is useful.

684
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,765
Let's get into
hypothesis generation.

685
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,333
David and I wrote a

686
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,536
paper on this.

687
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,505
And so Rob Lee and I, and David

688
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,906
really wrote the first one.

689
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,408
I forgot Rob was on there.

690
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,908
He's gonna kill me later.

691
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,511
Rob was on that first who, what,
where, when, and how paper.

692
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,113
David and I wrote this one,

693
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,281
which says if you're
going to do hunting,

694
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:07,018
you're generating one of
three types of hypotheses.

695
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,220
Just, if you're hunting,

696
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,721
it's coming from
one of three places.

697
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,524
One is friendly or
threat intelligence.

698
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,725
So some form of intelligence.

699
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,060
Maybe your folks
are doing something

700
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,528
and you're aware of that.

701
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,729
And maybe the adversary's
gonna do something different.

702
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,097
So you create a
hypothesis on that.

703
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,633
Or you read a report
and understand that

704
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,436
how an adversary is gonna
work and you look for it.

705
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,239
Situational awareness
is larger awareness

706
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,507
around what's going on

707
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,875
in that industry,
the organization,

708
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,144
technical as well
as non-technical.

709
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,912
And then domain expertise.

710
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,247
When people say things like,

711
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,449
it's an art, it's not a science,

712
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,717
that's bullshit.

713
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,252
They just don't know
that it's a science

714
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,787
and they haven't figured out
a way to articulate it yet.

715
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:44,623
So, we have to
understand it's actually

716
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,425
a domain expertise aspect.

717
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,026
And we gotta figure
out why it works.

718
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,594
It frustrates me to no end

719
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,263
walking into some senior shop

720
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,197
and the senior hunter
or whatever else...

721
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,133
You're like, "What do you
do on a day to day basis?"

722
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,768
"I don't know man,
figure it out.

723
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,869
"Like we just find stuff."

724
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,603
Like, you need to be fired.

725
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,906
Like that is not
an appropriate way.

726
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,407
What are you actually doing

727
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,109
that's repeatable
and successful?

728
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,377
"I just get lucky."

729
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,610
No you don't.

730
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,746
Figure out what it
is if you ever hope

731
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,014
to make that
organization better.

732
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,247
All right, so.

733
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,583
Case study number one.

734
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,852
Let's look at an intelligence
driven hypothesis

735
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:17,155
based case study
in manufacturing.

736
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,591
So we had a
manufacturing client.

737
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,459
When you think manufacturing,

738
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,795
it runs everything
from Campbell's Soup

739
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,264
to like weapons and missiles

740
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,765
and all that kind of good stuff.

741
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,367
Manufacturing is a
large, large field.

742
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,503
Anyways, a
manufacturer customer.

743
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,172
And they were concerned
about their security.

744
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,741
So one of the hypotheses
we generated was

745
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:41,446
if an adversary is gonna
do anything destructive,

746
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,014
they need to understand
the environments,

747
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,683
going back to that
kill chain model.

748
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,218
And it was an intelligence
driven hypothesis

749
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,786
'cause we'd already knew

750
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,921
that there were adversaries
operating in the world

751
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,556
that specifically
wanted to go after

752
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,758
these types of
manufacturing lines.

753
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,428
So we knew there was
a threat out there.

754
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,263
We were informed by that.

755
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:00,564
And we knew the model
for doing an attack.

756
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:02,534
So we had an intelligence
inject if you will

757
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,236
from a mindset of

758
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:07,472
there's badness, how
do I find it now,

759
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,008
based off what I know
the adversary's doing?

760
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,776
So the thought process was

761
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,714
if they're going to go after
and do anything destructive,

762
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,616
they've gotta get the
engineering documents

763
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,384
and understand how
the systems work.

764
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,020
Okay, where is that located?

765
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,258
And we found that all of these
sensitive ICS related files

766
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,360
weren't held in that facility.

767
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,663
The system integrator and
deployer of the system

768
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,131
is the folks that actually
have all the schematics

769
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,133
and engineering drawings.

770
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,801
So we ended up working with them

771
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,970
to see if they
had been breached.

772
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,639
It's always great when
you find a hypothesis

773
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,973
that's not successful.

774
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:43,375
Lot of good learning there.

775
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,677
Unfortunately, this
one was successful.

776
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,445
They had been breached
and they were saying,

777
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,347
"Oh yeah, some of
these engineering
documents were stolen

778
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,815
"but it wasn't a big deal."

779
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,083
It is a huge deal.

780
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,419
Not to them but to
their customer, right,

781
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,154
to the folks that rely on them.

782
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,124
So an intelligence driven
hypothesis helped us realize

783
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,326
that there was nothing
going back and making sure

784
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,194
that the integrator
was informing

785
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,263
the people that they
set up the networks for

786
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,598
and set up the ICS for

787
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,966
that they had been breached

788
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,900
and very sensitive
documents were being stolen

789
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,370
that was needed to target
that customer's environment.

790
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,606
So the fix for that was policy.

791
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,542
Boring, Rob talking about
policy at a hunting conference.

792
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,944
Yeah, it was a policy thing.

793
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,110
They specifically went back

794
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,279
and looked at the master
services agreement

795
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,414
and SLAs and said,

796
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,882
"You must inform
us in the future

797
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,917
"when these types of
things occur in general.

798
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,019
"And these are now a
priority one event for us

799
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,321
"and you have to tell
us in the future,

800
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,754
"like within six hours."

801
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,657
So good information
being driven back to

802
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,858
a future approach,

803
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,393
even though it's not
automation of the thing

804
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,462
in the way we would
think about it.

805
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:40,432
One of my favorite case studies.

806
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,034
So situational awareness
can be difficult for folks.

807
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,870
'Cause it requires you to look
away from packets sometimes,

808
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,772
or away from memory forensics,

809
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,206
and things that excites us.

810
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,542
In this case,

811
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:53,544
I had this hypothesis around

812
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,147
large construction
projects in Africa.

813
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,984
Specifically, there was a lot
of announcements going out

814
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,918
about new construction projects.

815
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,254
About new, cool places
that were ICS related

816
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,122
like hydroelectric facilities.

817
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,026
And we usually give
adversaries too much credit.

818
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,361
We say, "Oh, they
know how to target us.

819
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,695
"They know all these things."

820
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:12,129
No, they don't, they're humans.

821
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,466
Your adversary has management
and PowerPoint too.

822
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,934
They're just trying
to get by, right.

823
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,435
They're doing their thing.

824
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,971
So I know that they've got
to have a way to figure out

825
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,773
who to target in the world.

826
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,109
They've gotta do
target development.

827
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,443
So a great way to do
target development

828
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,479
is to look for giant
RFP announcements

829
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,180
or construction
project announcements

830
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,582
and new things
that are going on.

831
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,916
Get in at the ground floor.

832
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,283
Then if you ever need
the access later on,

833
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:34,719
you're part of the baseline

834
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,388
and you can take advantage
of it when you want.

835
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,956
So we came up with
the hypothesis,

836
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:39,456
based on the
situational awareness

837
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,326
around what was going on with
these construction projects

838
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,727
to say hey,

839
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,196
let's build out some
infrastructure sites

840
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,098
that are mimicking the ones
that are getting built.

841
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,399
Let's do some of
the honeypot stuff.

842
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,235
I didn't anything
about deception.

843
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,803
Please don't go down
that rabbit hole.

844
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,905
But looked at like
some honeypots

845
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,173
and light well level stuff,

846
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,875
and then also offered
some free services

847
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,876
to folks in the region

848
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,310
to be able to find stuff.

849
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,578
We ended up gaining access
to some environments

850
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,981
and finding some
early adversary recon.

851
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,649
An awesome opportunity to say,

852
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:07,052
yep, it looks like adversaries
are being interested

853
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,285
in these environments.

854
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,821
And of course, big
announcements like,

855
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,590
the most controversial dam
in Ethiopia getting built

856
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,125
is gonna draw some attention.

857
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,493
So that's what you
want to focus on.

858
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,028
Good hypothesis.

859
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,397
Last one I'll highlight, and
one of my favorites as well,

860
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,466
is a really basic one,

861
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,101
and again, I love basic stuff,

862
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,271
with domain expertise.

863
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,139
So I know in most
infrastructure sites,

864
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,643
but especially in utilities
like water and electric,

865
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,145
that there's nothing that
happens on that network

866
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:37,282
in a good way, outside
of maintenance periods.

867
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,617
I just know having
done it before

868
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,453
that if you're gonna
do updates or patching

869
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,155
or any sort of maintenance
or updates to the system

870
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,623
which classifies
under maintenance,

871
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,358
it's going to be a
maintenance window,

872
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,128
a specific time of year
they actually do this.

873
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,361
So, I had the hypothesis,

874
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,364
why don't we look for
patching and updates

875
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,467
to occur out of cycle?

876
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,401
I don't know why.

877
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,836
Maybe an adversary is doing...

878
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,571
I don't know, but that's
a good hypothesis.

879
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,172
Let's come up with a way
to look for adversaries

880
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,308
doing stuff in environments
outside of maintenance windows.

881
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:04,809
So at first, there was not a lot

882
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,344
of data collection available.

883
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,379
So it was a lot of manual
checking of patches

884
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:09,747
and the systems.

885
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,916
But also, doing some
base-lining of the network data.

886
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,452
'Cause you can usually get
network data at an ICS.

887
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,054
Turns out, they were.

888
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,856
They were infected and
there was an adversary

889
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,691
who kept patching
their systems for them.

890
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,192
And that's what we found.

891
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,994
We're like, why
is this adversary
patching these systems?

892
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,696
And by all accounts,
it looked like

893
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:26,531
they were doing bitcoin
mining on the systems,

894
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,899
and they kept patching 'em up

895
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,367
so nobody else would infect 'em.

896
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:31,569
That's great, like you
outsource your IT support help.

897
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,872
But preferably not
to your adversary.

898
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,808
So future automation is just
around collection of that

899
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,610
to be able to see and include

900
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,145
the temporal aspect of

901
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,113
when things should
happen in a network

902
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,215
with our collection to make
sure that we're actually

903
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,417
tying up our hunting efforts.

904
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,419
But you'll notice a theme here
as I sort of end this out.

905
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,757
Nothing I've said is
super sexy, crazy,

906
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,293
amazing, oh my gosh,
next level stuff.

907
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,695
And nothing I've talked
about is things that

908
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,532
couldn't use automation
after the fact.

909
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,001
But the initial
hypothesis generation

910
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,304
is how we slowly move that
automation umbrella forward.

911
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,507
Whether it's in an
IDS, an SLA, or AI.

912
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,209
Don't care what it is.

913
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:12,644
Don't care the hype
in the industry.

914
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,345
All of it has its place.

915
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,548
But we move that needle forward

916
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,117
through the human v
human aspect of it.

917
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,151
That's what it's about.

918
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,553
That's why we're here.

919
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,488
And it is entirely
accessible to all of you.

920
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,989
All of you can do it.

921
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,692
Your adversary may not
care about you, but I do.

922
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,227
You can do it guys, all right.

923
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,461
So recap.

924
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,097
Threat hunting is
a human process.

925
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,666
Anybody that tells you different

926
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,400
is likely trying to
sell you something.

927
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,471
Automation is key to
doing everything we do.

928
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:42,073
But you can't solely rely on it,

929
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,542
and you better understand
what's being automated.

930
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,444
Otherwise you'll never
know why the alert occurred

931
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,946
and what to do about it.

932
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,214
Number three,

933
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,715
hunting for threats
in places like ICS

934
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,417
ends up being really awesome.

935
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,084
I highly encourage
anybody that's interested

936
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,221
in the ICS community
to go check it out.

937
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,056
I have a blog out there as well

938
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,524
with a whole list of resources

939
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,292
about how to get started
in the ICS community.

940
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:02,526
If whatever else,

941
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,962
you can hit me up
after the fact.

942
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,496
I have like a fourth
point that you can't see,

943
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:07,165
'cause it's invisible
and it's new product.

944
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,933
Number fourth point is

945
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,635
Alex is doing some great stuff.

946
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,971
So a lot of this started
off with Alex and I

947
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,706
debating each other.

948
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,139
But the dude is frickin' awesome

949
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,375
so I'll just give a
hat tip to Alex up here

950
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,910
while I'm on stage

951
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,211
to note that he and his folks
are doing some amazing things

952
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,746
on the automation front,

953
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,081
and I'm really excited
about the developments

954
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,514
we're seeing in the community.

955
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:26,117
So with that, I'll close it out.

956
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,086
Thank you so much for your
time and patience today.

957
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,487
Enjoy the rest of
your conference.

958
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,390
(lively drumming)
