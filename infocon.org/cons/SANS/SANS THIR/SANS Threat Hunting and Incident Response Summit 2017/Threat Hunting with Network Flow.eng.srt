1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,169
(airy chime music)

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,210
(applause)

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,345
- So, when I was in grad school,

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,814
I had this internship
where I was asked

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,917
to write a paper on how
to profile a network,

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,652
or baseline a network,

7
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,322
using just network flow data.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,224
I said, "Okay,
sure, sounds good."

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,626
But what I was
really thinking was

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,496
what is network flow data?

11
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,730
And to make matters worse,

12
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,201
I was gonna use
this tool that was

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,270
a Linux command line tool,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,840
and I had actually
never used Linux before.

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,080
So, my boss at the time
was a really good mentor

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,416
and he gave me an
outline for the paper

17
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,985
and he showed me basic
commands to get me started.

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,853
And I did manage
to write the paper

19
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,389
and I actually got a job
offer after the internships,

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,525
so, I guess I did okay.

21
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,960
But that was my first
introduction to network flow

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,064
and since then I've
done a lot more complex

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:06,699
analyses using just
network flow data,

24
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:07,934
and it's actually kind of cool

25
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,869
what you can do with
this type of data.

26
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,138
So, lemme back up a minute for

27
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,175
people who maybe aren't
familiar with it.

28
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,277
I'll give you a quick
rundown on what it is.

29
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,279
Many of you probably
know what this is.

30
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,314
It's a Wireshark
packet capture, right?

31
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,616
So, you can think
of network flow

32
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,087
as essentially the
metadata of packet capture.

33
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,321
Packet capture,
of course, is when

34
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,623
you collect everything
coming across a sensor.

35
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,093
Network flow is a
stripped-down version of that.

36
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,695
It's things like IP
addresses, ports,

37
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,765
protocols, TCP flags, byte
counts, that sort of thing,

38
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
but no actual user data.

39
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,572
Typically doesn't have
application layer data either,

40
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,741
unless you're using
special collection sensors.

41
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,911
I'm not gonna get into the
types of collection sensors,

42
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,680
or the different
tools you can use.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,550
I want this presentation to
focus more on what the benefits

44
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,088
and some of the drawbacks
are for using network flow.

45
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,690
So, if network flow is just

46
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,325
a stripped-down version
of packet capture,

47
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,261
how could it be any better
than packet capture?

48
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,331
There are actually a lot of
different reasons to use it.

49
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,167
The biggest reason for some
people is that it's small.

50
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:16,803
Which means the query
time is very fast,

51
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,974
you can store it for
long periods of time
for your network,

52
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,275
and the bandwidth
required to pull queries

53
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:28,114
back and forth is a lot smaller
than if you're using Pcap.

54
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:30,817
It's automatable, like
a lot of datasets are,

55
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,687
depending on what tool
sets you're using.

56
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,855
And you generally
don't have to worry

57
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,290
about privacy concerns,

58
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,358
especially if you're
keeping the data in-house,

59
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,328
cause there's no
user data involved.

60
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:46,132
It's kind of like the
difference between a call log

61
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,835
versus a recording of
a phone conversation.

62
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,237
You know who called
whom and when,

63
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,408
but you don't know what
they actually talked about.

64
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,379
As with everything,
there's some cons as well.

65
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,579
The biggest one's probably that

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,682
there's no true way to validate

67
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,518
what's going on if you're
just using network flow data.

68
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,489
For example, I was
troubleshooting a network

69
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,491
in an exercise that
we'd built once,

70
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,361
and I saw what to me was
very obviously a DDoS attack.

71
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,230
There are a whole
bunch of IP addresses

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,399
attacking this one IP
address that happened to be

73
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,901
at a domain controller
on a network.

74
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,436
But when I looked closer,

75
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,538
I saw that it was a bunch
of internal user machines

76
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,608
that were booting up and going
to the domain controller.

77
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:31,344
They were just registering the
machines, it wasn't a DDoS.

78
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,515
But I couldn't validate that
with just network flow data.

79
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,285
It's a summary of
a conversation.

80
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:43,055
So, if your analysis requires
your data to be more granular,

81
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,793
network flow's not gonna be
your first choice for that.

82
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,394
And it's yet another tool.

83
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,663
It's yet another data set
that you have to collect,

84
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,333
provision, maintain and analyze.

85
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,202
So, all of that said,

86
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,471
what can you actually
do with this data?

87
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,740
I mentioned network
profiling up front,

88
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,774
that's an important thing to do,

89
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,509
it's all well and good,

90
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,978
but you can also use
it for threat hunting.

91
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,748
You can find known
malicious IPs,

92
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,584
you can look for
anomalous traffic,

93
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,587
beaconing, XFIL,
all kinds of stuff.

94
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,190
Now, lemme be clear,
I'm not advocating

95
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,958
that we just throw
in another tool set,

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,996
another data set and
hope for the best.

97
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,399
I think that the most effective
method of threat hunting,

98
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,868
as many people here
have already mentioned,

99
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,872
is to have analysts
who are well-trained

100
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,041
and capable of
critical thinking,

101
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,509
and then give them
the tools and the data

102
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,445
that they need to
do their mission.

103
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,114
And I'll admit I'm
a little biased,

104
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,582
but I think that
network flow should be

105
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,851
one of those data sets
that they have access to.

106
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:45,785
Here's why.

107
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,689
If you're an effective analyst,

108
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,191
you can use network
flow to find an attack

109
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,361
at almost every stage
of an intrusion.

110
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:57,930
I have the kill chain
up here just because

111
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,666
I think everyone in the
room is familiar with it

112
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,001
and I wanted to give us
all a frame of reference

113
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,871
for some of the examples
I'm gonna talk about.

114
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,539
Kill chain may or may not
work for every analysis,

115
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,412
but at least gives
us a framework to
be on the same page.

116
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,080
Active reconnaissance
is pretty easy

117
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,914
to find in network flow.

118
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,552
You would see maybe an
IP address, external IP,

119
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,254
hitting your web server
a bunch of times,

120
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:22,722
maybe they're looking
for information

121
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,157
about a corporation.

122
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,159
You would definitely
see port scans,

123
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,561
ping sweeps, stuff like that.

124
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,964
Weaponization, of course,
happens on the attacker side,

125
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,200
so you're not gonna see
that in network flow

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,202
unless for some reason
you have network flow

127
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,337
from the attacker's network,

128
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,839
which would be awesome.

129
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,908
But most of the time, we don't.

130
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,710
You might see if
it happens to be

131
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,244
an insider threat that
you're looking at,

132
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:49,082
you may see someone going
to a known hacking website

133
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,851
and pulling down
a bunch of data.

134
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,453
If it were someone in
this room, no big deal.

135
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,220
But if it's someone in
your finance department,

136
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:59,826
that's kinda weird, maybe you
should take a look at that.

137
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,295
Delivery. Assuming
it's a remote attack,

138
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,231
you're gonna see
it in network flow.

139
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,733
Delivery, of course,
there are a bunch

140
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,201
of different options for that,

141
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,237
so you might see someone
hitting a web server a

142
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,773
whole bunch of times over and
over and over and over again.

143
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,944
Or you might see a
bunch of large packets

144
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,247
on an email protocol sent
to everyone in your network.

145
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,816
Maybe spam, or maybe fishing,

146
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,352
it's something to look at.

147
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,822
All kinds of options
for delivery.

148
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:33,292
Exploitation is generally
thought of as a host-based step,

149
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,527
so you're not gonna see
that in network flow,

150
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,296
but what you can do with it is,

151
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,733
if you have a box that has
been successfully exploited,

152
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,402
and especially if
for some reason

153
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,805
they've cleared the logs, you
don't have forensics on it,

154
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,242
you can use the network
flow from just prior to that

155
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,711
to get a picture of next steps

156
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,945
and what you should look for.

157
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,782
So, for example, if
that was a web server

158
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,549
that just got popped,

159
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,419
then you saw that
traffic hitting

160
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,053
your web server over and over,

161
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,489
you might think it
could be a SQL injection

162
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,724
if that's a SQL back end,

163
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:07,960
or you might think brute
force password attack,

164
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,628
something like that.

165
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,633
If there's an
installation phase,

166
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,034
you'll probably see
that in network flow,

167
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,301
it'll probably show
up as a whole bunch

168
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,871
of large packets
going to the machine.

169
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,207
That data in and of itself
is not really interesting.

170
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,710
But if it comes from
a known malicious IP,

171
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,546
or if it comes
from an IP address

172
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,548
that just scanned your network,

173
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,417
that makes it a little
more interesting.

174
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,018
It would also be interesting if

175
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,788
it's a bunch of large
packets on a protocol

176
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,959
that shouldn't have large
packets, like DNS or SNMP.

177
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,363
Command and control
again, you'll see

178
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,332
we're assuming these
are remote attacks,

179
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,568
so it makes them
interesting, I think.

180
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,669
You'd see beaconing
definitely is

181
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,772
very easy to detect
in network flow,

182
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,674
whether you're looking
at a visualization,

183
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,941
a traffic graph,

184
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,110
or you can also do it
in streaming analytics

185
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,480
with network flow data as well.

186
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,649
If you're looking at an external

187
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,918
connection coming
inbound for C2,

188
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,154
you might look at
RDT connections

189
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,722
that aren't supposed
to be there,

190
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,224
external connections that
start from the outside

191
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,560
that an internal
host doesn't start,

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,296
which is normal for
web servers maybe

193
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:20,132
but not normal
for user machines.

194
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,002
Or you might see
odd-hours traffic.

195
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,270
Stuff like that is
what you'll look for

196
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,371
with command and control.

197
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,875
Actions on objective, of course,

198
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,077
can be a whole bunch
of different things.

199
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,112
Data XFIL is really easy
to see in network flow,

200
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,350
spike in traffic
line, real simple.

201
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,885
Lateral movement
is also easy to see

202
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:42,320
if you're instrumented
for network flow

203
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,759
inside of your network, not
just at your access points.

204
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,896
You might, for example,
notice that your

205
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,632
web server is scanning
your domain controller.

206
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,567
That's bad.

207
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,137
So, some of these examples
might seem maybe a little

208
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,641
contrived or a little
basic or you might say,

209
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:05,645
"Well, I can find that Pcap
or I can find that in my SIM.

210
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:09,081
"You know, why do I need
network flow anyway?"

211
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,584
When Sergei was up
here this morning,

212
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,051
I dunno if he's still here,

213
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,322
he talked about
the diamond model.

214
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,424
I think that the diamond
model is a really effective

215
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,560
framework for doing
intrusion analysis.

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,896
I've seen a lot of high-end
organizations using it,

217
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,464
albeit informally and sometimes

218
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,067
without even know
that they're using it.

219
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,537
But one of the main
analysis approaches

220
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,239
that relates to
the diamond model,

221
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,774
and I'm glad someone
asked the question

222
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,208
earlier and pointed it out,

223
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,810
is the pivot.

224
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,546
And network flow is perfect
for using as a pivot.

225
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,116
If you have, for example,
a malicious IP address

226
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,086
you know is malicious from
some intel or something,

227
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,056
you can look that
up in network flow,

228
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,224
and see if any of your
internal IP addresses

229
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,693
have touched that.

230
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,328
And if you find those,

231
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,697
then you can look those
up in network flow

232
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,634
and see if there's any anomalous
traffic coming from that.

233
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,403
If you have a timestamp
from anomalous traffic,

234
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,539
you can look that up in Pcap,

235
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,275
she thought I was
gonna say network flow,

236
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,346
you can look that up in Pcap
or any other tool, and so on.

237
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,448
So you start with
your first query,

238
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,016
you look it up in network flow,

239
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,819
pivot off of that, change
to a different tool,

240
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,889
and you build out your
picture of your adversary.

241
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,727
So, real world example of this.

242
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,962
One of my colleagues
was looking at

243
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,831
couple of IP addresses that were

244
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,334
known malicious addresses
from a particular APT.

245
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:39,438
He's using network
flow to look those up.

246
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,741
He didn't find anything.

247
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,543
So what he did was he
took those IP addresses

248
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:48,014
and expanded them to a
slash 24 network block.

249
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,615
Now, something like this is

250
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,651
really easy to look
up in network flow,

251
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,185
to take a whole slash
24 network block

252
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,188
look it up for a
year's worth of data

253
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,191
on a massive network
is no big deal.

254
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,394
So that's exactly what he did.

255
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:05,631
He looked those up, and
here's what he found.

256
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,767
He found several
multi-gigabyte spikes

257
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,005
in traffic outbound
over several days from

258
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,176
one internal IP address to
three external IP addresses.

259
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,746
He took that data,

260
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,016
and since we have the
internal IP address now,

261
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,084
he and the customer at the time

262
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,354
looked that up in their logs,

263
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,323
and they were able to determine
that this was a breach,

264
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,793
that it was data exfiltration,

265
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,829
too late, unfortunately,
to stop this one.

266
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,497
But they were at least
able to take those new IPs,

267
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,933
those new indicators,

268
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,602
and toss them back into the IDS.

269
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,608
One of the things
that I really like

270
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,643
about network flow is
that it's so quick.

271
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,312
Like I said, you
can do that full

272
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,582
slash 24 block, 30
seconds, no problem.

273
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,555
When we do exercises,
sometimes we'll have

274
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,291
analysts,

275
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,358
hunters,

276
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,460
whatever you wanna call them,

277
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:09,829
working on different tool sets

278
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,298
to find a particular
indicator or particular event.

279
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,532
There'll be someone on the IDS,

280
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,235
someone on SIM, someone on Pcap,

281
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,803
and someone looking
through network flow

282
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,372
usually for the first time ever.

283
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,540
And generally what happens,

284
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,943
and I might be a little biased,

285
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,645
but generally what
happens is that the person

286
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,880
looking through the network flow

287
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,515
is able to find
the indicator and

288
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,584
make a real quick interpretation

289
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,819
before anyone else has
really gotten a handle

290
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,923
on what's going on
with the other tools.

291
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,358
Which brings me
to another reason

292
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,626
why I like network flow,

293
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,560
and some of you may
disagree with this.

294
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,732
It forces analysts to use
their critical thinking skills.

295
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,202
If you don't have an IDS
telling you what happened,

296
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,504
you don't have Pcap,

297
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,472
but you can look through
to figure out the story,

298
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,942
you have to make an
interpretation based on

299
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,277
your experience and your

300
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,679
foundational
knowledge of networks.

301
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,914
And you might say,

302
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,848
"Well, you know,
that's not good.

303
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,518
"I want even my
most inexperienced

304
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,987
"analyst to be able to do this."

305
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,723
I think it was Robert
Lee who mentioned

306
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:14,126
yesterday that we really
want the threat hunters to be

307
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,461
the more experienced analysts,

308
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,930
and I tend to agree with that.

309
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,733
The easy queries, the things
like looking up an IP address,

310
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,570
those can be
automated, no big deal.

311
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,439
I'm talking about the
type of analysis where

312
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,675
you have to be able to
understand and explain

313
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,144
what happened during an event.

314
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,679
You have to be able to tell the

315
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,982
who, what where, when and how.

316
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,983
And you have to be able
to make recommendations

317
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,954
on how to mitigate
it in the future.

318
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,623
For example, I was running
an exercise once where

319
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,661
we had set up a
simple beaconing,

320
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,564
internal IP address beaconing
out to a malicious IP.

321
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,565
Fairly simple set up.

322
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,802
And the group knew that the
external IP was malicious,

323
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,239
so it was really easy for
them to find the activity.

324
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,976
But we asked them to
explain what was happening.

325
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,578
Now, the particular
analyst that was

326
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,413
working on this
was pretty junior,

327
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,815
and he wasn't able to
tell me anything beyond

328
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,250
what the IDS was telling him,

329
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,487
which honestly wasn't much
other than there's a connection.

330
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,122
So, what I did was
I walked him through

331
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,825
the network flow data.

332
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,527
We started with
that external IP,

333
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,028
we looked at who
it connected to,

334
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,764
who that connected
to, et cetera.

335
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,067
And through that process,
we ended up going over

336
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,036
how the NAT routing was
set up in that network,

337
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,271
we went through
the DNS recursion

338
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,107
set up in that network,

339
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,507
we talked a little bit about

340
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,111
standard versus
non-standard ports.

341
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,779
And we talked a little bit about

342
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:44,183
standard or typical
web traffic patterns.

343
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,020
And after going all
of that with him,

344
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,622
he was able to make
a determination about

345
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,725
what his next step needed to be

346
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,927
to do the rest of his analysis.

347
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,996
In that case, it was
he needed to pull Pcap

348
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:01,100
from a particular internal
IP address to finish it off.

349
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,839
So, hopefully I've
given you at least

350
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,574
a little bit of a picture about

351
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,376
what some of the benefits are,

352
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,944
and of course there
are drawbacks as well.

353
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,015
I'm gonna leave you
with one more thing.

354
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:20,586
I mentioned network profiling
at the beginning and,

355
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,254
or you can think
of it as baseline,

356
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,023
or finding your cyber terrain,

357
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,792
however you wanna talk about it.

358
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,861
And this is, of
course, extremely

359
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,795
important for network defense,

360
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,264
figuring out what's
on your network,

361
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,134
who it's talking
to, when it changes,

362
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,368
and you can automate this,

363
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,536
you can do it with all
kinds of data sets,

364
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,037
you can do it with network flow,

365
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,008
run it every day, week,
month, whatever you want.

366
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,911
So, I was doing this process
once on a particular network,

367
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,713
and I was doing it
manually for some reason,

368
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,180
I have no idea why,

369
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:52,685
but I was finding
DNS servers manually,

370
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,387
I was manually
finding NAT routers,

371
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,357
I was manually finding
VPN concentrators ...

372
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,358
By the way, I think
one of the important

373
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,094
skills to have as an
analyst or threat hunter

374
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,630
is the ability to
do inscripting,

375
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,132
so, maybe I shoulda done that.

376
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,171
When I got to the web servers,

377
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,707
there were a bazillion of them.

378
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,442
There were orders of
magnitude more than

379
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,779
what I had found for any of
the other hosts on the network.

380
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,749
And typically, when you do
profiling or baselining,

381
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,217
especially if it's
the first time

382
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,251
you're doing it on your network,

383
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,187
you'll find some weird stuff.

384
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,991
You might find a web server
that you thought was unplugged,

385
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,360
but it's still sitting
there active on the network.

386
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,029
You might find some FTP traffic

387
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,398
that you thought that
you had locked down.

388
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,801
Or you might find
something weird like this.

389
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,403
To know what was going on here,

390
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,705
I'd have to tell you what
I actually queried for so,

391
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,774
for simplicity's
sake, let's say that

392
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,411
I was looking for outbound
traffic from source 80

393
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,580
for my internal IP
address's web port.

394
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,886
So why would I have so many
web servers on the network?

395
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,154
I don't, right?

396
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,925
For this analysis, all I
had was network flow data,

397
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,194
so I had to figure
it out through that.

398
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,931
After doing some different
analytics I realized that

399
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,968
all of these hosts
were responding to

400
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,238
a low slow stealth
scan on webport 80.

401
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,807
Went across the entire network.

402
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,609
And there are a whole
bunch of problems with that

403
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:28,046
from a network defense
standpoint, right?

404
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,617
The scan got in, nobody
alerted on the scan,

405
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,585
there are a whole bunch
of user machines that

406
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:34,820
are supposed to
be locked down but

407
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,557
are responding on port
80, that's not good.

408
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,659
But the extra cool part was that

409
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,828
we ended up with a couple
of extra indicators

410
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,264
that turned out
to be IP addresses

411
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,565
that are being used
by a particular known

412
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,237
APT that was specifically
targeting this network.

413
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,173
And in addition to that,
we had the indicator

414
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:58,010
of a new type of scan
that that APT was using.

415
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,582
So, that's my plug for
using network flow.

416
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,387
I can talk a ton more
about what analytics to use

417
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:11,623
or what tools to use
or that sort of thing.

418
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:16,028
But I think one of the
biggest pros to this

419
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,598
is that it doesn't
require any fancy tools.

420
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,002
Just Linux skills if
that's all you have.

421
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,772
(sinister music)
