1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,520
uh we're gonna go ahead and get kicked

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,920
off with our

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,799
next presenter who i am really excited

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,960
to introduce

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,400
it's kind of funny um peter and i worked

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
together in former life

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,160
uh where he was on our team uh with a

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
contracting company

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,960
and we kind of had you know

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,560
he was in a different office and we kind

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,599
of you know moved to different roles

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519
different jobs

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,679
and i want to say it was two years ago

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,800
peter at the d first summit

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,079
in austin somebody had mentioned oh yeah

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,919
yeah peter's here and i'm like wait a

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,960
minute the same peter ortiz that i used

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,800
to work with and and

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
obviously it was so it was kind of cool

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,718
reconnection and uh and now we've got

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,079
you on board here with uh with speaking

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,480
at the summit too which is uh

23
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,600
is really cool so small world indeed

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,919
um anyway yeah so

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
uh so anyway peter comes us uh now with

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,239
a cyber reason uh where he is

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,078
uh focused on incident response and

28
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,279
threat hunting obviously a perfect fit

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
for the uh for the summit

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
and he's gonna be talking about building

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
a threat hunting program and this is

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
really important because so many times

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
people will come to us or

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,280
just have conversations in the physical

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
or virtual hallways and say

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400
i want to get started with thread

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
hunting how do i start where do i where

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
do i begin that process

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
and it's not an easy answer to to

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,119
provide it's not like there's a simple

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
checklist for it but i'm excited for

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
these these approaches that you're going

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
to be bringing to us because i think

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
the folks who are going to be watching

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
this now and in the future will be able

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
to apply

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
the the findings and and the lessons

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,240
learned that you're bringing here today

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
and figure out how that applies best to

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,000
their own requirements for their own

51
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,559
security

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
program so that said uh we're really

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
glad to have you here peter and uh

54
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,479
excited for your uh your tale of two

55
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
hunters

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,840
thanks so much thanks so much for that

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,880
uh let's see

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,600
can i click around and here we go

59
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,119
all right so hi everyone uh thanks for

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,679
attending this talk today uh

61
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,360
as uh as i said my name is peter ortiz

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
i'll be walking you through some of the

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
approaches used to build

64
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
um threat hunting teams that i've been

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,280
part of personally part of developing

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
um one of the things i'd like to preface

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,200
here is that

68
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
everything i'm going to say um i i

69
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
didn't start

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
building these teams on my own it took a

71
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,679
group of talented individuals

72
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
uh but hopefully there are some

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,599
perspectives here that can give you an

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
idea

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,799
of the things you can do to help

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,920
progress your own program's

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
uh maturity uh so

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,119
a little bit about myself uh i'm the

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,480
senior director of global solution

80
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
services for cyber reason

81
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,000
i've been uh with cyber reasons since

82
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
2016. uh

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,760
before this i've had multiple roles in

84
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,319
digital forensics incident response and

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
even

86
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,839
uh dipped in my toe in that e-discovery

87
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,679
world

88
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
um but i spend the most of my the

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
majority of my free time advocating for

90
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,800
families in scouting

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,080
since i have a son who's a bsa tender

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,239
foot and a daughter who

93
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,599
is a cub scout wolf uh here we go

94
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,200
yes okay so let's take a moment to set

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,839
up what we're going to go through

96
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,440
we'll be talking about two teams both

97
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,159
with the same vision

98
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,159
and goal to be hyper-mature teams

99
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,679
capable of delivering their idea of

100
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,120
threat hunting in a reliable and

101
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
repeatable manner

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,040
we'll do a year-by-year breakdown of the

103
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
key initiatives each team undertook

104
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
and how those initiatives benefited the

105
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
respective teams

106
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
and we'll also talk about uh how you can

107
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,359
take some of these techniques and make

108
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
them work for yourself

109
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
um you know as phil said we we often

110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
hear about

111
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
these are the things you should do in

112
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
threat hunting these are the things you

113
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
should go look for these are

114
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,760
this is how you should do it uh

115
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,760
hopefully this will show you that it's a

116
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,518
it's a it's a it's an approach that

117
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,679
you're going to have to work at

118
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
that it's not going to be an overnight

119
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
turned on turnkey solution

120
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
it's it takes years of work it takes

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
years of determination

122
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
um and the skill sets and the people to

123
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,439
be able to do it

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,360
um where we begin is we have

125
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
let's start about talking about the two

126
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
types of teams we had

127
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,640
uh on one side we had a team of scrappy

128
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,560
do-it-yourselfers

129
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,319
and on the other side a team that was

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
afforded the privilege of having that

131
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,518
executive buy-in that we always talk

132
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,920
about and the tech stack

133
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
that gave them you know a leg up on

134
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,079
everything

135
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
also take note of the years here one

136
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,959
team

137
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,280
uh was being developed when apts were

138
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
really beginning to emerge as a publicly

139
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
known commercial threats operation and

140
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
aurora had just been publicly disclosed

141
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
a year earlier

142
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,638
and many non-tech companies were barely

143
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,520
getting beginning to understand the

144
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
severity

145
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,440
associated with that knight dragon

146
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
night dragon operation would soon be for

147
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
this team

148
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
something that they would have to be

149
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
aware of or something they would have to

150
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
deal with

151
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,198
uh we also have to take into

152
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
consideration the tech and the mentality

153
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
of the time

154
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,960
security teams were still focusing on

155
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
those perimeter firewalls looking to

156
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,960
av tech for solutions and cc

157
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,520
and the only executives who were uh kind

158
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,198
of

159
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
pushing the charge or leading the charge

160
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
here were those who kept their ear to

161
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
the ground to hear more

162
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
uh more rumblings about apts and

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
corporate espionage

164
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,120
and uh it would be these two campaigns

165
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,400
so operation uh operation aurora

166
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,800
and night watch uh night dragon um that

167
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,638
later became uh breaches for these

168
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,600
companies or motivating factors to

169
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,000
mature security organizations

170
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
when we talk about this scrappy group of

171
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,639
diy-ers

172
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
they really were a group of

173
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,039
self-starters sometimes scrounging

174
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
together pieces of tech to make things

175
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,520
work

176
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
the the team itself was involved in the

177
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,880
defer sans

178
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
infosec communities uh listening and

179
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
talking to peers

180
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
um you know the the main goal here was

181
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
to protect the enterprise

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,240
so in order to do so they would have to

183
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,800
mature the program

184
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,600
um and at the end of the day we knew

185
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,520
that uh

186
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
we were going to be our own customer uh

187
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,318
that we would have to prove

188
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,239
our value back to the business and with

189
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
any established company you know that

190
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
there's a lot of red tape to make your

191
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,520
way

192
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,520
through so everything has to be very

193
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,000
business oriented

194
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,799
the second security team they had the

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
experience

196
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,199
of a of a very hyper mature

197
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,120
cyber executive cyber executive staff

198
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,600
who were completely bought into the idea

199
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,360
from day one this made progress a lot

200
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
easier to realize because they had

201
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
that executive buy-in they had we had

202
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,758
alliances

203
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,600
with the devops team we had resources

204
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
that we could throw at projects

205
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,160
and i would say most importantly we had

206
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,039
an agile mentality that was already kind

207
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
of existing

208
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,000
that we just adopted so those are all

209
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
things to just kind of keep in the back

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
of your mind when we're talking about

211
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
these two teams and the challenges they

212
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,360
uh during the process of building the

213
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,360
teams

214
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,280
so now that we have a high level

215
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,960
overview of kind of the stakes that both

216
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,359
uh the stakes that both teams

217
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,719
were facing uh we'll go through each one

218
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,080
of the teams

219
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,280
one at a time and we'll start with our

220
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
scrappy diyers

221
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,599
our first year about covering the basics

222
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,599
so

223
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,080
understanding what the table stakes were

224
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,360
for having a solid security practice

225
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,039
one of the things we really had to be

226
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
cognizant about was the fact that

227
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,800
everything had to be

228
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,479
very well calculated again this is a

229
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,039
large global organization

230
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,758
and things just take time lots of red

231
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,639
tape

232
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,240
um the founding team really was just

233
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,160
three members a

234
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,960
a seasoned uh a seasoned air force osi

235
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
vet um a seasoned i.t forensicator who

236
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
had been with the company for a long

237
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
time that just happened to be

238
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,039
involved with sans and a dfir automation

239
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,919
guy

240
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,280
we had this base level of skill set of

241
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,719
someone you could understand the

242
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,719
policies

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
understand the tech and the business and

244
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,879
understand the gaps

245
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,759
and what you're trying to do and is any

246
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
good team

247
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,800
does when they first enter uh a new

248
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,599
organization

249
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,240
is we did stack review we really took a

250
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,400
look at

251
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,560
uh examining what tools we already had

252
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,520
at our support at our disposal

253
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
and where there were gaps in those tools

254
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
for us

255
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,160
we had your standard perimeter

256
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,440
technologies and some basic endpoint

257
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,919
tech

258
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
for the parameter technologies it was it

259
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,039
was standard stuff

260
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,878
firewall logs proxy logs vpn logs

261
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,719
that just needed to be centralized which

262
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
led us to a large investment in sim

263
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
technology

264
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,760
there were also existing security tools

265
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,640
such as ips

266
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
avs those proxies we talked about and

267
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
enterprise forensics tools

268
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
and these enterprise forensics tools are

269
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
the same ones we used for dead box

270
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
forensics on the investigation side just

271
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
over the wire

272
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,040
um and these same tools were leveraged

273
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
also for e-discovery

274
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
had some had some traditional incident

275
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,480
response capability

276
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
um but when you think about where we

277
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
were then and where we are now

278
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,199
nowhere near the capabilities where we

279
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,120
have now um

280
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
and we were really trying to push that

281
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
envelope for the kinds of live responses

282
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
we were trying to get to

283
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,600
um the last area we had to review was

284
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,519
what kind of policies we had in place

285
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
what did our incident response plan look

286
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,160
like did we have compliance requirements

287
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
we had to also figure out what we were

288
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,600
going to try to map to how we were going

289
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,079
to hold ourselves accountable for this

290
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
program that was being built

291
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
the other thing we had to keep in mind

292
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,160
is this team was actually a sub team

293
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,880
of a digital investigations team so that

294
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,719
means

295
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,399
that many of us were dual rolled in

296
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,680
digital forensic investigations

297
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,839
and leading this ir charge so we had to

298
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,599
balance where our focus was going to be

299
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
on on really on a daily basis

300
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,839
um when we when we talk about year two

301
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
when we when we look at the

302
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,680
things that we accomplished for some of

303
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,959
the key initiatives for that second year

304
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,800
it really was making cyber a thing for

305
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
the business

306
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,880
we're now getting a lot of data into the

307
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
sim we start analyzing that data that

308
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
was coming in

309
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,839
and writing those sim based correlation

310
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,479
detections

311
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
and and honestly this rule writing took

312
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,079
up a huge chunk of our time

313
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,839
between writing the rules and managing

314
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,439
the sim itself

315
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
i can remember we would actually spend

316
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
days on days having white board sessions

317
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
workshopping rules based on the data

318
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
that was coming in from the from the

319
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
different data sources

320
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
trying to go through a standard that you

321
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,479
know that standard hunting logic

322
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,640
where we develop a hypothesis and then

323
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
we test it on the data that we had

324
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
and then we continuously refined that

325
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
detection until we said something with a

326
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
low false pos

327
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
full positivity rate and a high

328
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,279
confidence rating

329
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,399
um and and that was just that was just

330
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,279
daily standard daily operations for us

331
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,440
uh we also built a diy soar platform

332
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,240
before soar platforms were a thing

333
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,959
um which was built from scratch using

334
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
sharepoint

335
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,599
and a custom built python back-end uh we

336
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
essentially built an orchestration

337
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
platform

338
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,040
and ticketing system and and for us that

339
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
was a major accomplishment because now

340
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
we could

341
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,760
start producing metrics on what we were

342
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
doing and how we were getting

343
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,279
how we were performing as a team

344
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,279
but we knew early on that we had to

345
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,279
automate as much as we could

346
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,760
and we were able to a lot automate a lot

347
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,000
of the mundane tasks such as ticketing

348
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
help desk submissions live response

349
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
collections

350
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,480
and data enrichment so on the data

351
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
enrichment side

352
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,959
correlating to vt threats um as well as

353
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
pulling in

354
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,599
business intel data from business

355
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,399
systems that were already existing

356
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
from a documentation perspective we

357
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,959
began to look at how we could

358
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,560
measure our program we be we also made

359
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,959
the decision to start aligning

360
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,800
to a measurable framework which brought

361
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,680
us to evaluating the nist framework and

362
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,680
understanding the

363
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,439
lift associated with you know checking

364
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
those check boxes

365
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
we also began response readiness

366
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,000
planning to make sure we had that

367
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,480
documented procedure

368
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
for any event that may come our way we

369
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,040
started building playbooks on how to

370
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,079
respond

371
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,360
to the alerts that were coming out

372
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,599
one of the biggest things that really

373
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,920
helped us in this time

374
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
was an initiative that our cso really

375
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,240
pushed for us to deliver

376
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
um he wanted us he wanted the experts in

377
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,639
cyber

378
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,639
uh to get in front of the people who

379
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
could talk cyber talk cyber to the

380
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,160
business

381
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,240
he wanted us to brief different portions

382
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,639
of the business on cyber threats

383
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,279
cyber risk and why it's important and

384
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
what those

385
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,200
what are those threats um he was really

386
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,480
trying to get us

387
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,480
bought into the business

388
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,239
and we would also go through these

389
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,079
tabletop exercises

390
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,440
um with these kind of these same

391
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,359
business entities

392
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,200
uh to understand where we are as a

393
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
company when it comes to executing a

394
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,079
response plan

395
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,760
um we decided early on that there was a

396
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,638
large lift in work here

397
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,560
um we have these foundational table

398
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
stakes that we need to work on

399
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,279
but we also need to kind of up level

400
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,479
up up up level the uh the detections

401
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,360
piece that we're doing

402
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,000
um so we we brought on some additional

403
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
support

404
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
as a stop gap to help us focus on

405
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,880
maturing the program

406
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
um and we also brought in some of the

407
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,600
early

408
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,599
early stages of tiered triage

409
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,880
um so we brought in some folks to help

410
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,880
us we brought in someone

411
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,439
one person uh to help us uh do those l1

412
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,200
alerts from both the manage provider and

413
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
the alerts that we were writing

414
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
that the three of us were writing off of

415
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,320
the

416
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
off of the sim detections

417
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,959
um year three we really kind of

418
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,920
turned a page um we we started focusing

419
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,800
really on

420
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,240
threat based hunting um sometimes the

421
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
data that you have is

422
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
all that you have we we've heard some

423
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,880
talks today talking about

424
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,319
modeling data and and putting data into

425
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,959
into certain into certain

426
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
structures so that you can look at it we

427
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,920
were we were doing

428
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
where we were doing that we were looking

429
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,160
at the behavior of the data

430
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,120
uh the behavior of the attackers and

431
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,040
trying to make

432
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,920
uh detections based on that

433
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
we needed uh we needed a reinforcements

434
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,719
obviously

435
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
we brought in an additional tier one

436
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,079
analyst to help us you know

437
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,680
over those additional hurdles that were

438
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,519
coming in

439
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,359
but more importantly we needed someone

440
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,760
with threat knowledge

441
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,320
and that understood the geopolitics

442
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,920
since we are a global entity

443
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
we needed someone who would understand

444
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,479
those geopolitical issues

445
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
and on top of that we brought in a

446
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
tooling engineer

447
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,319
to free up analysts from troubleshooting

448
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
cause calls we were spending a lot of

449
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,680
our time

450
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,719
not only writing detections

451
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,479
understanding data

452
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
making sure data sources were being

453
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,920
brought in but just

454
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,480
working with the tool itself um

455
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,959
we brought in uh we started to really

456
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
lean into our diy soar platform build

457
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,359
out

458
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,000
uh we were bringing in more automation

459
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
more tasks we were doing automated

460
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
triage for a while

461
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,360
um building those little bits and pieces

462
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,040
that just made it faster

463
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,800
um a big a big hurdle we we overcame was

464
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,839
launching live response collections with

465
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
sim alerts

466
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,760
um we knew that as the alert was coming

467
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,240
in we needed to be able to go

468
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,839
do something pull data off and have that

469
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,639
data for an analyst

470
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,040
um and since we now had some tier one

471
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,959
people

472
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,959
looking at these alerts we we were

473
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,880
getting a lot of feedback on

474
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,319
what was true positive false positive

475
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
and how we could work our way through

476
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,279
that

477
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,040
um and we we strive for more visibility

478
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,560
um we've you know we've we've talked

479
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,319
about that we've heard about security

480
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
onion today and bro today and some of

481
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,399
the different

482
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,759
uh open source projects um but that's

483
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,199
really where we started going he said

484
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,800
okay if we can't if we can

485
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,800
if we can't pay for it and get something

486
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
else start getting our own

487
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,399
type of technology in uh and let's start

488
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,319
increasing the logging on our endpoints

489
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,320
for those dfir situations

490
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,639
when we actually just need to go grab

491
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,639
data

492
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,560
in year four is really when uh the

493
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,439
balance shifts for us

494
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,319
we actually start to outpace the mssp

495
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
that we had

496
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
so we actually are able to alert on

497
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,319
things and find things

498
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,880
faster than they are but it was about an

499
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,440
average of two days

500
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,959
so we are actually able to stay ahead

501
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,000
and start putting in compensating

502
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,439
controls

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
uh way before that happens um

504
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,600
we really embraced uh so we we brought

505
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
on two more tier two analysts

506
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,639
and this was this was a huge lift off us

507
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,160
so now

508
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,320
they are helping with writing the

509
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,560
playbooks with with automations with

510
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,079
detections with with process and

511
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,119
and process flow and we really embraced

512
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,959
what would be the security onion alerts

513
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,199
we integrated more with the itt

514
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,039
ticketing system so that way we could

515
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,760
take more actions and have more response

516
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,839
actions kind of just automated

517
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,199
and it's this last point that we really

518
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,119
what we really

519
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,240
focused on we were a whole group of

520
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,760
digital forensic d4 people and we really

521
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,559
wanted a new tech stack

522
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,039
we wanted uh to be able to take our team

523
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,399
and say

524
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,039
look just give me data give me more data

525
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
give me an endpoint dvr you know so i

526
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,520
can go look through the data and

527
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,240
understand what's there and

528
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,679
we'll write rules we'll figure it out

529
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,200
and we also said we need you know

530
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,679
network monitoring we need some kind of

531
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,120
deep packet inspection technology to

532
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,120
see what's going on there

533
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
and i over clicked i apologize

534
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,000
um as as with anything though

535
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,760
there was we we knew what we we got more

536
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,799
than we bargained for

537
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,200
we had that buy-in but

538
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,559
the market just decimated the entire

539
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,240
industry

540
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,559
and things were cut and things had to go

541
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
we had that we needed full alignment and

542
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
we had about three quarters

543
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,679
of that which is which one voice can

544
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,159
really tip favors one way or the other

545
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,280
and occasionally in the business itself

546
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,480
we got

547
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:31,200
pulled way too far into the weeds

548
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
now we'll talk about uh the second group

549
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
that we had

550
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,120
so this is a team that uh is a little

551
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,480
bit more

552
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,760
uh that had some advantages to it um

553
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,880
this team was able to start over coming

554
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,720
in but not start from scratch

555
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
there was already a sock that kind of

556
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,559
handled alerts coming out of this this

557
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,879
platform

558
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,080
but the threat hunting site needed more

559
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,120
maturity

560
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,320
it was being performed ad hoc so um and

561
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,039
it was being you

562
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,159
and it was leveraging existing uh

563
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,400
technologies or

564
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
existing methodologies for performing

565
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
hunting

566
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,799
um we've seen these before baselining

567
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,799
stat counting clustering grouping

568
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,559
but when we're talking about uh

569
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,240
adversarial behaviors

570
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,240
it really it really didn't line up um

571
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,080
because there's so much there's so much

572
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,120
of a lift that's associated with that

573
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,039
but these were the

574
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,639
these were the thought processes that

575
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,960
this team had at the time

576
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
uh coming from the previous team uh the

577
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
diy-er group

578
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,120
um we knew that we could do better with

579
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
more behavioral focus analysis and if we

580
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,439
took that thread intel

581
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,760
and really leaned into it we could build

582
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
uh

583
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,960
detections that could uh you know

584
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,959
short-circuit a lot of the analysis

585
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,799
year two we we had a team that actually

586
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
used a scrum process for the sprints so

587
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,080
the sock actually had

588
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,439
a very um regimented process already

589
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,480
just for project management reasons

590
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,320
and we kind of adopted that same that

591
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,840
same methodology so that way we could

592
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,639
hold ourselves accountable and see

593
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,840
incremental

594
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,480
value and incremental change what we did

595
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,559
during those two weeks scrum spurns

596
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,559
that's the time that we took to go

597
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,918
through our hunting methodology

598
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,879
our pre-hunting methodology developing

599
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
hypotheses

600
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
off of research that we were seeing out

601
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
in the open

602
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,400
so looking at vendors looking for

603
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
looking at

604
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,640
information sharing groups looking at

605
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,720
peer groups looking at um

606
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,960
academic researchers that were out there

607
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,039
or twitter blogs

608
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,000
um testing that against the data set

609
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,080
that we had

610
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,400
um so making sure that we could have

611
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
something to translate in the translates

612
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,480
into the data we had

613
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,360
but not only that we we also took the

614
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,760
time to build

615
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,479
uh forward thinking rules so we built

616
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,919
yara

617
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,120
and um and snort rules just in case we

618
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,600
would ever have those kinds of

619
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,360
capabilities

620
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,959
at this point it was really just you

621
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,000
know one person hunting over

622
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,320
a small handful of our environments

623
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,520
and in order to expand you needed more

624
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,559
hands you needed

625
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,440
better processes and really

626
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,000
leaning into automation so there was

627
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,799
some time

628
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,320
spent learning what the apis were how to

629
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,840
leverage the apis

630
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,840
and which mundane tasks could be really

631
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,120
automated

632
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,120
um year three

633
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,959
um yep okay

634
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:46,639
uh year three um we really leaned into

635
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,360
now mapping to mitre this is where

636
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,440
we kind of moved away from those those

637
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,918
techniques of stat counting

638
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,559
and clustering and grouping and pulling

639
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,159
just these

640
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,240
two million rows of data now looking for

641
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,159
adversarial techniques that we know are

642
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,120
being used right now

643
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,840
um we brought in some uh additional

644
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,678
folks

645
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,360
who were threat hunters with reverse

646
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,320
engineering experience some d4

647
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,840
experience

648
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,760
um but really had a passion for

649
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,039
reading about threats understanding the

650
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
threats and

651
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,799
wanted to tear every bit and piece apart

652
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,919
to understand

653
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,320
how we could find something um some of

654
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
the

655
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,439
the things that that this team kind of

656
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,760
said was

657
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,080
look um we're spending way too much time

658
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,280
on just the reverse engineering piece

659
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
um so we we put a we put an investment

660
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,799
into

661
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,559
our analysis sandbox for them um so that

662
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,000
they could speed up that part of their

663
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,320
process

664
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,480
um the other piece that they they wanted

665
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,918
was hey we need access to

666
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,480
to more data to more threat intel repos

667
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,120
um and so that's where groups like

668
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
maupedia came through or virus total

669
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
enterprise descriptions you know those

670
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,919
pieces

671
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,559
getting them access to the data that

672
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
they wanted

673
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,158
introducing them to peer groups um so

674
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,520
they have someone else to talk to

675
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,159
um but it was really focusing on that

676
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,520
on moving over that reliance away from

677
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,799
uh that that align

678
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,200
reliance on that outlier analysis and

679
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
focusing more on those indicators of

680
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
behavior

681
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,960
um mapping to mitre attacks so that way

682
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,918
you could have now this rich

683
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
data set that we know that adversaries

684
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,679
are actually using

685
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,879
and using that to go in and look for

686
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,640
things

687
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
because when really what we're trying to

688
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,840
do is

689
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,480
not spend as much time

690
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,439
digging through data to find a needle in

691
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,960
a haystack

692
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,960
if we already know how the adversary

693
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,360
acts how the adversary moves the

694
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,440
operations that the adversary takes

695
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,120
why not spend more time looking for

696
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,240
those things than

697
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,678
um let's say an outlier schedule

698
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,159
task you know that that's going to give

699
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,039
you

700
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,640
so much data we have to look for for

701
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,799
other ways to say look let's

702
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,000
let's complement these two pieces if we

703
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,559
have a schedule task

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
plus we have something else over here

705
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,440
let's

706
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,679
reduce those two those two techniques

707
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
together and say now let's see when we

708
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,559
have

709
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,320
the a the one on the left and let's see

710
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,600
when we have on the one on the right

711
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:33,600
and see where they intersect as far as

712
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:36,959
as the data goes

713
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,120
year four um we we

714
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,159
we're taking a lot of the things that

715
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,080
the first team had

716
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,080
we're taking that behavioral base

717
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,559
hunting approach we're bringing in

718
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,158
uh threat intel data and using thread

719
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,639
intel data to move ahead

720
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,200
we're we're mapping to the behavioral

721
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,960
pieces

722
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
and and seeing where those behavioral

723
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,080
pieces kind of intersect with what we're

724
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
doing

725
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,158
um we were still doing it on on a

726
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,279
cadence basis but we were

727
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,039
we were wanting to get faster because um

728
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,200
there's there's no benefit when you're

729
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,640
hunting there's no benefit to doing

730
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,559
it later and later after

731
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,799
after these techniques are being used or

732
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,600
after reports or emerging threats are

733
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,559
showing

734
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,520
um so we moved kind of these individual

735
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,080
jobs off of

736
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,320
people's laptops and moved them into an

737
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,199
automated source into the soar platform

738
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,240
we didn't

739
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,039
build it this time we just got one off

740
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
the shelf

741
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,640
um and used that sore platform to

742
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,120
automate

743
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
a lot of this workflow um and we

744
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
integrated

745
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,960
with a lot of different pieces at this

746
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,520
time um

747
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,520
one of the things we noticed was that we

748
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,000
were generating a lot of content

749
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
um the thread intel team now uh the

750
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,159
threat hunt team

751
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,799
who's building the content is generating

752
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,640
a lot of this

753
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,360
it needed to go somewhere it needed to

754
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,120
be in a common format as well

755
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,600
and so this is where you start to look

756
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,320
at threat intel platforms you look at

757
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,158
miss or you look at yeti or you look at

758
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,520
any of those other technologies and say

759
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,600
look

760
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
i'm going to put this data in here now

761
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,199
sort

762
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,399
you come grab data and go look for it in

763
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,919
the platform

764
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
um and also a major a major hurdle that

765
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,320
we we lifted was

766
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,720
providing that data to the sock um so

767
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,918
that way the sock now had the additional

768
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,039
context and data of emerging threats

769
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,799
to kind of bump up against what this

770
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,000
allowed the sock to do was actually move

771
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,320
much faster

772
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,640
because the sock is now not spending so

773
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,279
much time researching and reading

774
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,880
but actually the threat hunt team is

775
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,799
going in and presenting

776
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,559
uh debriefs saying these are the threats

777
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,000
that are happening this week

778
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,840
these are the major campaigns we're

779
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,840
monitoring um these

780
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,158
are the techniques that you'll be seeing

781
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,199
uh as detections as alerts coming

782
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,159
through to you

783
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,240
um and anything that's a high fidelity

784
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,159
alert we're going to go submit tickets

785
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,480
for the product team to go put those

786
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,000
into that uh into that detection

787
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,400
platform

788
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
um so that's talks to a lot of you know

789
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,360
standardizing the packages

790
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,279
leveraging uh a platform uh and getting

791
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,279
the sock involved so that way they can

792
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,720
understand and we were actually able to

793
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:20,399
use the sock as a tier one analyst so

794
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,080
you know someone someone earlier in one

795
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,439
of the talks said you know leveraging

796
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,000
the the folks that you have

797
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
this is really where we transform the

798
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
data

799
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,679
and transform the alert into something

800
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,918
that was um

801
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,200
that was researchable a good lead to go

802
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,600
follow on

803
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,960
plus they had the thread intel data to

804
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,080
kind of marry those

805
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,080
two pieces together

806
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,000
when we uh when we're when we're looking

807
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,399
at why

808
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,520
this team was also successful both teams

809
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:54,719
were successful in their own ways

810
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,960
this team the buy-in really for them

811
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:02,080
was their large crucial point

812
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,279
in the diy team we were

813
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,360
this this our the cso at the time wanted

814
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,919
us to get in front of the business

815
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,360
um so we could so we could communicate

816
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,679
so we could socialize

817
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,120
and we could help build the case for why

818
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,880
cyber is important

819
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,559
why threat hunting is important why

820
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,159
understanding threats and risks is

821
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,158
important

822
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,000
this time we didn't have to spend as

823
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,760
much time

824
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,200
doing that in front of executives or

825
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,279
getting that senior management buy-in

826
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,840
and it really was the convergence of the

827
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,640
right tech and methodology at the time

828
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,320
um the the tech at first was right and

829
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,000
the methodology was wrong

830
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,360
and then we we kind of fixed that with

831
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,919
some of the things the first team was

832
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,240
doing

833
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
we brought in that that that threat

834
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,960
hunting methodology

835
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,880
um that behavioral-based analysis and we

836
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,039
married those two together and that gave

837
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,480
us kind of like a year and a half

838
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,480
of of lead uh on the other team

839
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
uh and being able to focus and lean in

840
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,120
on that threat intel

841
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,679
based that threat intel base hunting um

842
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,158
there are even though you have you know

843
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,720
mitre

844
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,679
as a framework when we when we go

845
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
through

846
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,679
the threat intel research that's being

847
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,719
published you will always

848
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,760
find unique pieces of information

849
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,720
that that are unique to that that

850
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,960
threat actor or that campaign that you

851
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,600
can go look for additionally

852
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,080
so being able to actually just spend the

853
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,678
time

854
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,879
to understand the threats to read the

855
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,880
reports to read the research

856
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,919
and not have to be bogged down with all

857
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
the other

858
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,399
business related pieces the

859
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,760
socialization the consulting of the

860
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,760
larger business

861
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,200
i mean actually just being able to focus

862
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:55,840
on those pieces

863
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,840
really made this team successful

864
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,200
um so when we when we talk about

865
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,959
about this um there was there will

866
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,919
always be someone who

867
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,360
who has their eyes on you um there

868
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,760
there's always going to be

869
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,439
a c-suite executive or a high-level

870
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,039
executive there is always going to be an

871
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,480
executive buyer

872
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,240
or someone you're trying to sell the

873
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,240
business to um

874
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,279
having their buy-in is crucial to the

875
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,000
success how do we get that buy-in

876
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,960
socialization understand the risks

877
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,960
understand

878
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,520
um how to talk to this in a business

879
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,320
context what is the risk to the business

880
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,520
um when we when we've talked

881
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,320
traditionally about

882
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,840
um different breaches that have happened

883
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,480
in the past

884
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,559
we've i've always heard you know the one

885
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,559
of the phrases that i i've heard a lot

886
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,039
probably in in my entire career is

887
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,799
always well we're not a bank

888
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,399
we don't have to worry about that

889
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,000
because we're not a bank

890
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,678
um and you know another phrase was well

891
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,399
you know we don't have to worry about

892
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:04,240
that kind of of espionage because

893
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,199
we do x instead to mitigate that

894
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,039
but now where we are in in the today

895
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,559
since this pandemic has started

896
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,760
is we are now looking at every company

897
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,440
that has a footprint on the internet um

898
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,440
is exposed to different threats now

899
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,799
uh they're exposed to this ransomware

900
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,919
piece they're exposed to

901
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,840
to everything that's there um and it's

902
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
it's a real business for these

903
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,840
adversaries now

904
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,679
and it's a real threat to the business

905
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,840
so being able to communicate

906
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,679
what that change is and how that change

907
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,918
has happened over time

908
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,120
is going to be crucial to your success

909
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,600
um

910
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,399
the the technology also affects how

911
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,158
agile

912
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,719
that we can be um don't be afraid to

913
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,000
change your technology in five years

914
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,080
um because when we look at the

915
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,480
technology from five years prior

916
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,600
and then five years prior to that so we

917
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
look at technology

918
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,240
five years ago and then technology 10

919
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,760
years ago things have come a long way

920
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,080
um so keeping up with a technology or

921
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,039
or looking forward at a technology in

922
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,918
five years

923
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,960
um there will be dramatic technological

924
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,159
improvements

925
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,640
that will help us become more agile

926
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,039
as defenders to these threats that we're

927
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,799
facing

928
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,640
making sure you understand what your

929
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,039
mission is and what your requirements

930
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,240
are for your different projects

931
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,000
don't be afraid to spend time building

932
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
out requirements for anything that

933
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,600
you're looking for

934
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,880
if you're looking to bring in a thread

935
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,719
intel platform

936
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,399
build requirements what do you want to

937
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
do out of what do you want this thing to

938
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,039
do

939
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,840
what do you hope to get out of it and

940
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,840
does it fit your needs

941
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,480
and understand what those needs are and

942
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,439
how that's going to affect the business

943
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,760
and really spend time developing the

944
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,399
people in the in your process

945
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,200
there is there's no real substitution

946
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,158
for that

947
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,559
take the time to make sure that everyone

948
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,600
is

949
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,799
getting or has access to some breadth of

950
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,639
knowledge above their own knowledge um

951
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,840
and if if if you don't have that

952
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,480
knowledge go

953
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,240
find someone in the community spend time

954
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
in in these different groups or these

955
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,039
different settings

956
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,960
to find mentors understand what the

957
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,440
processes of your business are and how

958
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,000
those

959
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
and how those processes uh have been

960
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,600
updated in the past

961
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,080
uh and leverage the strengths of what

962
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,840
you have

963
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,840
uh and with that i can open it up for

964
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
questions
