1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,600
um

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,280
it is my distinct pleasure to uh

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,000
introduce you to uh someone who i'm sure

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,799
a lot of you have

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,360
heard speak before ben johnson um it's

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,040
kind of cool

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,480
ben and i first started working together

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,000
back in 2003

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
you know that makes us sound really old

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,800
but uh seems sometimes like it was just

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
yesterday

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,880
uh when i think uh uh we probably had a

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,880
room

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
what was that room we worked in probably

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,640
like 20 by 20

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
yeah and there were six or seven of us

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
working in that room doing some

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,680
pretty good stuff i was i was

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,040
reminiscing about that the other day but

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,280
um definitely a a long background

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,160
uh career-wise of uh of pretty

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
fascinating

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
efforts both company-wise as well as

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
just uh mission-wise

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,000
um formative years of carbon black uh

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,160
working with obsidian now as well

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
and uh always interesting to hear your

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,879
perspective so i'm glad to have you here

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
and i'm especially interested now with

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,879
us looking at the

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
service-based economy um at the way that

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
we might

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
extend the concept of threat hunting

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,799
into that

35
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
that world of of software as a service

36
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
which has been a bit of a

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,600
um you know a void in our sight picture

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
for some time so i'm

39
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,520
excited for some of your ideas on how we

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
can make good at that and

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,640
how we can improve the game so without

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
any further delay

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439

that kind of thing but um look uh you

64
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200

65
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,919
the last few years

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
is uh thinking about cloud security and

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,759
most

68
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,878
specifically sas and a lot of what's

69
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,119
been happening

70
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,079
in my discussions is that security teams

71
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,959
just don't really know

72
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,640
what they should be doing right you know

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,840
i'm talking straight up to csos even

74
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
though i'm a vendor

75
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
you know we have a very cordial like

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
friendly conversation it's not sometimes

77
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
the you know sort of

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
vendor versus uh you know buyer uh

79
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
conversation where everyone's guarded

80
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,599
it's like no

81
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
dude just help me like think about the

82
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,720
problem i'm not even looking to buy tech

83
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
or do whatever right now it's just like

84
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
help me think about the problem so i can

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
educate the business right so

86
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
um i'm spending a lot of time thinking

87
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,000
about that and then i really love threat

88
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
hunting

89
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
and incident response so it felt like a

90
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,399
a really good uh

91
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,160
pairing of topics now my background and

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
yeah hopefully i've i've spoken with a

93
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,959
bunch of you before

94
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,599
uh got my start at nsa uh in 2000

95
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
and uh you know saw the whole uh 2000s

96
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,440
basically of a lot of you know conflict

97
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
out there and get to you know work with

98
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,879
great people like uh

99
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,440
like phil and uh and rob lee and and

100
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,679
others um just just a great team

101
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
incredible talent density we did some

102
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,319
amazing things that uh

103
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
i would have done i think we all would

104
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,119
have done for free and they they

105
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,000
actually paid us for so it was pretty

106
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
phenomenal

107
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,879
uh and then i got a little bit tired of

108
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,560
the the government world so i wanted to

109
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,200
do something on the commercial side so i

110
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,720
ended up

111
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
uh working with a few friends and the

112
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,080
idea for carbon black came up and so i

113
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,119
became one of the founders there and the

114
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
cto and

115
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,200
get to travel the world speaking to lots

116
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,200
of different organizations i i estimated

117
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
about 600 different enterprises

118
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,798
uh globally about uh you know endpoint

119
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
security but really everything

120
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
uh and then uh we grew to about 800

121
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,280
people and i kind of want to do it again

122
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,640
so

123
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,799
started obsidian with a couple other

124
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,079
guys glenn and matt and

125
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,920
we're focused more on you know kind of

126
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
cloud detection response and

127
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,518
and threats in in your sas and stuff

128
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
like that so this is not

129
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,200
meant to be a vendor pitch or anything

130
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,959
like that but you know really focused on

131
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,280
on kind of what's going on with you know

132
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
all these different applications

133
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
and then i love the national security

134
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,920
mission so i was fortunate enough to

135
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
join the us fisa court and get to work

136
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,839
with some really

137
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,159
interesting people we'll say on some

138
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
very interesting cases

139
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
so that's enough about me i just want to

140
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,839
dive in now um

141
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
you know i think if you've seen me speak

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
before i almost always

143
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,959
have this slide or something very

144
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,638
similar it's i just hope that

145
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
i guess we have about 40 minutes total

146
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,080
at the end of the 40 minutes hopefully

147
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,440
you felt this was time well spent right

148
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,599
and so hopefully you get some forced

149
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
reflection time some contemplation

150
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
you know give you some stuff to remember

151
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
that kind of thing you know usually if

152
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,320
it's an in-person conference it's like

153
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
hopefully you get some time to shut off

154
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,599
the laptop put down the phone and

155
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,359
actually consume some information

156
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
think about your your challenges your

157
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
goals your strategies with your security

158
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,758
program

159
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,960
uh a little bit more difficult maybe

160
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,400
like some of you might be on your

161
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,758
corporate slack right now or checking

162
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,159
email or whatever but at least hopefully

163
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
you're

164
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,400
you're listening in um and so uh

165
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
looks like we have a little bit of um uh

166
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,638
font

167
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,560
challenges but that's okay we'll we'll

168
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,120
roll with it cloud is accelerating

169
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,639
business

170
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,240
um and uh you know the whole really

171
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
notion of a security team right now is

172
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,759
to enable business to advance its

173
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,359
mission safely and i'm basically

174
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,360
stealing quotes out of

175
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
you know different cisos mouths of like

176
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
hey i just i just need to

177
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,758
enable my business to advance its

178
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
mission and do it with minimal risk

179
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
right

180
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,599
um and i think 2020 and the global

181
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
climate and the work from anywhere

182
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,400
really just kind of exacerbated the the

183
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
problem of how do we allow people to

184
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,599
connect from different places

185
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,440
now we have a thousand offices for a

186
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
thousand people or whatever right so

187
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,719
there's just a lot a lot going on and

188
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
you know cloud is really at the center

189
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
of it now

190
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,159
and especially sas right uh and so

191
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,680
um if you don't have sass yet it's

192
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,199
coming i probably don't even need this

193
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,199
slide anymore because everyone

194
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,759
is like on zoom for example or you're

195
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,759
using g suite or office 365 or probably

196
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,360
hundreds of other applications uh but

197
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
the whole point is you know it's

198
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,360
only going to continue to be part of our

199
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
businesses right you talk to

200
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
to csos and like i sort of said and i

201
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,639
think put in the abstract

202
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,880
the journey will end in sas like none of

203
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
us want to manage hardware none of us

204
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,240
want to manage really anything below

205
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
what the business needs

206
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,919
you know the business application the

207
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
business value so if we can outsource

208
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
that

209
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
to service providers we can outsource

210
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
that to the

211
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,880
actual sas applications you know we i

212
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
think would love to do it

213
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,000
and you know it's not just about an

214
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,520
individual sas app like

215
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
if you're not familiar with some of this

216
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,280
stuff like these apps talk to each other

217
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,318
there's integrations between so many of

218
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
them it's basically

219
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,039
n squared problem like pretty much

220
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
everything can integrate with everything

221
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,759
else

222
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,599
which makes our jobs as defenders

223
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
challenging to try to you know just kind

224
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
of defend all the ways in and all the

225
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,520
ways data can flow out right

226
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,359
now um this is probably something you've

227
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
already seen and certainly seen if

228
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,039
you've

229
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,639
gone to a cloud security summit or maybe

230
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,120
you've even used a slide like this but

231
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,599
you know essentially just as you go from

232
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,720
on-prem to is to pass to sas

233
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:58,159
you have less and less responsibility

234
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,479
however you still have responsibility

235
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
for things like who has access what

236
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,280
devices are being used to access that

237
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
what's the data inside it and how's that

238
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
data being used what's the behavior that

239
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,360
kind of thing so

240
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,120
even though it's someone else's

241
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,319
infrastructure and the data is living

242
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
there the accounts and everything else

243
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,120
is living there

244
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
you still have the responsibility to

245
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
defend it

246
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,400
right and a lot of cloud like a lot of

247
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,479
times when you hear cloud people think

248
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,758
is but a lot of it's sas and i'm

249
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,280
actually stealing this quote from from

250
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
one of the sans instructors

251
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,440
but uh you know 75 or at least the

252
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
majority of cloud is sas

253
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,960
and i think it's only getting more

254
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,960
popular with things like you know the

255
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
2020 climate

256
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,599
so sas security needs to be priority

257
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,280
apologize this was a white slide so it's

258
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,280
a little bit easier to see

259
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,799
i'll take the the fault of getting

260
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,239
jennifer the slides late so

261
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,240
so my fault but hopefully you can still

262
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,280
see this but

263
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
everyone's using sas uh you're going to

264
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,239
these applications uh and guess what if

265
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,080
you read like a salesforce article or

266
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,599
the documentation on microsoft's website

267
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,800
or other things like they're still

268
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,639
telling you like you need to be

269
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
regularly monitoring this and looking at

270
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,120
it and stuff like that right and you

271
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
have these always-on

272
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
targets you have users that are just you

273
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,840
know let's be honest it's it's tough

274
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,159
wrangling our employees our user

275
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,318
population

276
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,240
there's not a lot of expertise in sort

277
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,879
of detection or hunting that we'll talk

278
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
about

279
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,440
um because it's new like we all grew up

280
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,520
looking at malware looking at uh

281
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
you know iocs from the endpoint looking

282
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,719
at dns and other

283
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
you know i'm sure great talks that are

284
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
going on in the last couple days

285
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
uh you know we grew up with that stuff

286
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,679
we're more comfortable with that but

287
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,679
what does you know what do you do when

288
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,958
you have you know everyone using duo and

289
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,399
you have everyone on slack and these

290
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,518
kinds of things right so it's it's just

291
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
a new world

292
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,640
and then of course there's always over

293
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
access everyone has too much access

294
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,839
which just increases risk

295
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
and then all these different systems are

296
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
disparate and different logs and that

297
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,080
kind of thing which

298
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,680
we'll talk about in a little bit so it's

299
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
it's a little bit of a challenging

300
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,719
problem i just want to do a time check

301
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,560
cool um

302
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,760
and you know just again i like to quote

303
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,518
you all

304
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
i t is going from zero to 100 in the

305
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,880
cloud leaving us in the dust or we're

306
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,000
blind to all these new sas accounts

307
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,519
a lot of irs now or office 365 or other

308
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
you know sas based applications and

309
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
there's lots of accounts and often no

310
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,080
governance so

311
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
you know sort of stacked against us so

312
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,440
we have to do something here

313
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,880
okay now i'm kind of blending detection

314
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
and hunting and i'll tell you why in a

315
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
second but um

316
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,959
you know i i well maybe i'll just tell

317
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,719
you now um

318
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,399
i feel like if you're not already doing

319
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
detection

320
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
like good detection in some of these

321
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
applications it's really the same doing

322
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,279
detection and hunting now i don't think

323
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
those two things are the same thing and

324
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,200
in fact i think i have a slide

325
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
in a second about that but i'm going to

326
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
talk about them almost as if they're the

327
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
same thing but i'll explain why i think

328
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
they're they're

329
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,480
actually very different things in a

330
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920
second but when we think about cloud

331
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,000
so we said we want to enable the

332
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,120
business to advance its mission

333
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,839
safely right uh so we want to protect

334
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
the business

335
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,040
but a lot of these tools are in place

336
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
because they're

337
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,240
adding productivity gains they're saving

338
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
costs

339
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,600
like if you start to get in the way of

340
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
those things you're going to get yelled

341
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
at

342
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,640
right um and so you want to maintain

343
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
those good relationships you want people

344
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,079
to listen to you to come to you before

345
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,959
they install that application which

346
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,640
doesn't usually happen um so what can

347
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
you do well you do need to think do

348
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
things like reviewing access and

349
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
monitoring access you need to understand

350
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,279
privilege and i sort of break those

351
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
apart access versus privilege

352
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,760
and then you need to think about how

353
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,120
things are configured and ultimately

354
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,399
what is the behavior how are people

355
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
using these applications

356
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
and if you think about it it's really

357
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,839
not that different from on premise

358
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,479
however

359
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,920
most of the the the actual application

360
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,040
the stack the you know underlying

361
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,519
infrastructure that's not in your

362
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,439
control

363
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,040
you can't just go you know lock down

364
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,240
something in the os when it's a sas

365
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,360
application because you have no control

366
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
you might even be able to lock down the

367
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
sas application

368
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,279
so it is a little bit different you have

369
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,279
to kind of work around some of that

370
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,040
stuff

371
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,640
and so when you think about it you know

372
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,399
choose your your framework protect the

373
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,839
tech respond whatever but you want to

374
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,079
worry about like what's

375
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
going on with account access is there

376
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
responsible use is a responsible

377
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
collaboration

378
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
and then really can you detect misuse

379
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,839
compromise unwanted behavior and then

380
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
investigate right really detect and

381
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
respond

382
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
and just because you don't necessarily

383
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,560
see a lot of problems like

384
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
maybe at the newspaper headline level or

385
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,359
you know

386
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,439
your your company doesn't feel like it's

387
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,079
a you know on fire um that doesn't mean

388
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
it's healthy

389
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,920
right i stole this from a ted talk about

390
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
health but uh the absence of disease

391
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,880
does not mean health and often these sas

392
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,800
applications there's a lot of

393
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,760
just kind of risk and hygiene issues and

394
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,399
stuff too which we'll talk about as well

395
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,319
so thinking about hunting and i know

396
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,120
everyone has a slightly different

397
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,440
uh you know maybe definition of hunting

398
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
but

399
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,279
to me if you have a hundred percent of

400
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
all the unwanted behavior basically all

401
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,240
the threats

402
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,959
that are in your environment your

403
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,440
technology is never going to detect 100

404
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,880
so let's say your technology detects 80

405
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,920
just as an easy number

406
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,000
so that remaining 20 gap to me is where

407
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,040
human has to go in

408
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,800
with a thesis or a hypothesis or some

409
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,959
intelligence and go look for activity

410
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,560
access for other items that shouldn't be

411
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,239
occurring or existing in your

412
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,439
environment so it's the gap between

413
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,519
where the technology

414
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,200
has stopped alerting you and detecting

415
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,480
you and surfacing it

416
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,360
and the totality of threats so to me

417
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,120
really hunting

418
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,279
is you go find something that wasn't

419
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,040
automatically kind of surfaced for you

420
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,399
and then the idea is you go back and

421
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
improve detection so it gets

422
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
you know closer and closer to 100

423
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,040
knowing that there's always change

424
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,839
there's always karen feeding that kind

425
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
of thing so

426
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
that's where detection and hunting are

427
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,399
to me very similar but

428
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
you know if i hear automated threat

429
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
hunting to me that's detection that's

430
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,760
literally the definition of detection

431
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
but then when it's manual more of a

432
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,120
human uh activity

433
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
where you're applying your critical

434
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,160
thought your time your investigative

435
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
uh and sort of review skills that's

436
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,399
hunting

437
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
right and so it's it's kind of going to

438
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
be blended together here because i'm

439
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,079
guessing a lot of people are not doing

440
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,480
the

441
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,680
detection right so it's kind of like hey

442
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
a bunch of things you're talking about

443
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
should just be

444
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,720
detected well yeah but if you haven't

445
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,120
done that you have to go hunt for it and

446
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,959
then

447
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
turn it into a rule right so that's

448
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,399
where i'm coming from

449
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,399
uh and then when you're doing hunting to

450
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,079
me it's it's all about very fast

451
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,800
sort of left right left right left right

452
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,319
right similar to i think ir or triage

453
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,560
like you have a thread to pull

454
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
and then you start going down one path

455
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,920
well the goal is to very quickly

456
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,920
invalidate that path

457
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,519
because you could go down forever and

458
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,040
it's the wrong path so the quicker you

459
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,200
can invalidate that and go a different

460
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,399
direction or pivot on a different ioc or

461
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
different attribute

462
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,600
the better and hunting is kind of the

463
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,120
same way like the quicker you can

464
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,880
basically exclude uh the better you'll

465
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,279
do and to me hunting is really more

466
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,439
about

467
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,199
exclusion than inclusion you basically

468
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,160
see what's going on and you like filter

469
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,760
out a bunch of stuff

470
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,279
okay see what's left filter out a bunch

471
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,480
of stuff right that kind of thing but

472
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,439
it's all about trying to move fast

473
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
because none of us have enough time here

474
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
so uh think about detection what do you

475
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
want to detect what are your concerns

476
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
around external attackers what are your

477
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,560
concerns around malicious insiders

478
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
you could pick and choose what you're

479
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
thinking about but then with hunting

480
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
it's really like well what

481
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,359
what are you looking for what are you

482
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,959
trying to think about and then do you

483
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,160
have the data and do you have the time

484
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,359
right and then you know finally before i

485
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,880
dive into a little bit more

486
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,279
specifics uh i've given a couple talks

487
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,720
like at b-sides augusta besides columbus

488
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,680
where this is kind of blown up into a

489
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,279
whole talk

490
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,439
but it's basically like you can slow

491
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,000
attackers down you can speed defenders

492
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
up

493
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,959
you can encourage good you know choices

494
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
or discourage bad choices that's

495
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,359
basically

496
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,959
everything we do right and so my my sort

497
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,360
of question and we'll come back to this

498
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,160
is when you're hunting are you finding

499
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
things

500
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,439
it doesn't have to be a you know an

501
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,519
adversary or evil it could be

502
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,360
a gap it could be a misconfiguration it

503
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,000
could be other deficiencies in your

504
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,839
environment

505
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,160
that can be the outcome from hunting

506
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,600
from the you know sort of the reviewing

507
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,439
um that helps you actually harden

508
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,639
for making it you know harder for

509
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,800
attackers to get in or

510
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
you know you find some gaps in your

511
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,319
telemetry collection and then okay so

512
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,000
you're to actually speed defenders up by

513
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,639
fixing that so just want to throw this

514
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,320
out there but

515
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,000
it's not just about finding evil it's

516
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
actually about how can you use

517
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,279
these you kind of hunt missions to just

518
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,719
improve everything it's kind of like in

519
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,399
a tabletop exercise you

520
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,839
you probably improve all sorts of stuff

521
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,199
not just technical controls but

522
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,720
communication and all sorts of other

523
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,839
policies and such right

524
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
so same thing here and then

525
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,120
are you going to use native tooling or

526
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,519
are you going to pull telemetry

527
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
well i'll give you i'll give you a i'll

528
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,680
cheat and tell you that you can

529
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,160
pretty much use native tools but you're

530
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,839
going to

531
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,519
get very frustrated and so i'm going to

532
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,959
go actually more through native tooling

533
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
but what you're going to want to do is

534
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,160
probably centralize the telemetry

535
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,839
similar to what you'd want to do maybe

536
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,399
elsewhere in your your tech stack right

537
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,680
you're

538
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,160
you're you're not going to want to

539
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
bounce between you know specific uh

540
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
like windows event logs you'd rather

541
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,880
pull all that back to an edr provider or

542
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,758
something like that it's kind of the

543
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,680
same thing

544
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,440
uh in sas but probably even worse

545
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,880
because the logs are so different but

546
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,959
you know you can still do some things in

547
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
some of the native native ui's native

548
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,518
consoles right

549
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
so uh so

550
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
okay getting a little bit more detailed

551
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,959
here right the primary goal here is to

552
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
keep adversaries out but then you want

553
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,719
to understand

554
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
you know kind of what your privileged

555
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
users are doing any changes

556
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,719
and then you know understanding sharing

557
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,599
and things like buckets other things

558
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,279
like that

559
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,880
um and then you know any changes to the

560
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,079
surface area so these are all areas you

561
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
need to start thinking about if you're

562
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
not

563
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
really thinking about this in sas and

564
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,600
then this could lead to like okay maybe

565
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,920
we'll go hunt for this kind of activity

566
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,759
um and then insider threats uh we've

567
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,439
seen a huge uptake in uh people

568
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
concerned about insider threats

569
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,800
uh either a because they just feel like

570
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,160
they have more ip or more

571
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,160
uh concerns around uh insiders uh

572
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
having uncertainty about job prospects

573
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,719
and things like that so they might

574
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
you know have a little bit more

575
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,079
disgruntled employee population and

576
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
we've seen some pretty nasty uh

577
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,800
you know someone deletes all the s3

578
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,120
buckets on the way out the door kind of

579
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,959
thing

580
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
in production which is not fun for

581
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,160
anybody uh

582
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,320
but you know just especially if your ip

583
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,360
heavy company insider threats become

584
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,240
very interesting as well uh so if we're

585
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,399
thinking about

586
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,079
uh you know stuff like logins and let's

587
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
say you dove into

588
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,839
microsoft 365 um

589
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,520
they're going to give you like the list

590
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,958
of all the logins like who's logging in

591
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,760
and where they're logging in from right

592
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,199
so that's cool

593
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
and you can start to search based on

594
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
time stamp and you know date time and

595
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,520
things like that

596
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,480
however if you see it's not the best

597
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,760
kind of ui to to use for hunting right

598
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
it's it's really

599
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,799
um there's no geolocation information

600
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
it's

601
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,080
you know you can do some exclusion and

602
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
things like that so

603
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,280
i would rather have you start looking at

604
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,919
some of this data

605
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
than do nothing but you're probably

606
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,080
going to run into some limitations

607
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,879
pretty quick

608
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,000
and if you think about g suite and if

609
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
you've ever played around in g

610
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
suite you can kind of do the same thing

611
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,960
like you can log in you can look for ip

612
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,480
addresses and do some filtering and

613
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,080
stuff like that and start to

614
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
define like where are some logins coming

615
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,799
from because you know this might sound

616
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
super basic but

617
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,480
do you even know where people are

618
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,120
logging in from to your sas like to g

619
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
suite

620
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
like i'm guessing most people don't i

621
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,280
talked to companies

622
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,879
that have 183 countries logging in and

623
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,559
they thought they had like three

624
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
because they realized all their people

625
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,440
are all over and they have customers

626
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,678
logging into some of these sas apps and

627
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,679
stuff like that um but

628
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,200
it's just this hasn't really been

629
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
central to your you know sort of

630
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
visibility and monitoring so there's

631
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
often a lot of surprises here

632
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,080
now again the challenge here is you're

633
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,280
not necessarily getting geolocation

634
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,960
information so

635
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,320
you know something that something can to

636
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
consider but i would still recommend

637
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,280
diving in and starting to just look at

638
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,639
and get comfortable with

639
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,840
how are people logging in and what's

640
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,799
going on are they using password are

641
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,320
they using saml

642
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,480
you know other other kind of methods to

643
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
get in that kind of thing

644
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
and then if you look at something like

645
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,160
salesforce um salesforce does a little

646
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,520
bit better job i have plenty of issues

647
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,840
with salesforce

648
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,840
it's a huge application with all sorts

649
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,240
of craziness inside it

650
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,840
however if you look at it they do some

651
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,440
geolocation information they give you

652
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,959
the application

653
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
maybe even if there's different login

654
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
urls things like that sometimes they'll

655
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,640
there's none here but sometimes they'll

656
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,799
try to fill in the browser information

657
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
so this is where you can maybe start to

658
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
dive in and start to look for anomalies

659
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,360
and things like that like some

660
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
application you didn't expect was being

661
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,520
used to log in or some location

662
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,039
right so really you know really starting

663
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
to get a little bit more context here

664
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,760
which helps you hunt right you can't

665
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,760
really hunt if you don't have any sort

666
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,600
of understanding of the data or context

667
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,200
the more you can start to pull together

668
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,480
the better right so

669
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,880
salesforce is doing a little bit better

670
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,960
job here for stuff like logins

671
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
so if i summarize this and i have a few

672
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
of these little like

673
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,120
areas to discuss um you know like

674
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,080
to give you some ideas of where to maybe

675
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
start like simply looking at admin login

676
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,080
times and locations

677
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,280
your admins and i i've i've observed

678
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,000
organizations that have

679
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,320
hundreds of thousands of uh sas accounts

680
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
like

681
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,159
you know big organizations and such they

682
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,640
still usually have

683
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
pretty small admin population which is

684
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,960
great

685
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
and the admins are almost always in like

686
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
one or two countries even if it's like a

687
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,360
global company

688
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
right uh you know maybe the admins are

689
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,760
in the us and the uk or india

690
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
and uh and netherlands or whatever but

691
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,039
it's not like a hundred countries so can

692
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,360
you start to hunt for

693
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,720
suspicious kind of locations and things

694
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,158
like that and if you think about my

695
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,840
earlier comments

696
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,280
this should all be turned into a simple

697
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,879
detection rule

698
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,320
but the reason i'm calling it hunting is

699
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
because you probably are not

700
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
doing detection here yet so you have to

701
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
go hunt for it and then convert it to a

702
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,918
detection rule

703
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,120
right and then after the admin uh you

704
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,880
know sort of population you have the

705
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,239
overall user population which again

706
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,080
could be 10x 100 x

707
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,919
000x the the admin population so are

708
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,840
there unusual login locations things

709
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,280
like that it's kind of hard to predict

710
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,720
time stamps and such because everyone

711
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,240
has like their phone logging in all

712
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,840
night so it kind of looks like you're

713
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,679
you're pretty much logging in all the

714
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,559
time but

715
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,320
you know locations and such should be

716
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
should be uh useful and i'll give you

717
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
some hints like

718
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,879
slack for example on our phones logs in

719
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,360
all the time and is a great

720
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
uh sort of tracker of where you're at

721
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,918
when someone goes on

722
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,760
you know like we use slack it obsidian

723
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,440
when someone goes on on vacation

724
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,879
overseas you can basically see every

725
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,080
single city they've been in and stuff

726
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,520
like that because slack is always

727
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,639
logging in unless you you know shut it

728
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,158
down

729
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
but can you use some of that information

730
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,880
when you're when you're kind of looking

731
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,080
at the population

732
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,240
of course things trying to get ahead of

733
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,080
the problem you know spikes and field

734
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
logins for a particular user and again

735
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
all this should be detection rules what

736
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,360
i'm bringing up is hunting because

737
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,960
i just see so many companies that are

738
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
not doing any sort of detection like

739
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
this

740
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,480
and then if there's a particular country

741
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,080
that's just trying to log into a bunch

742
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
of users especially if you don't have

743
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,320
any people there

744
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,640
that kind of thing that's great and then

745
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,639
maybe you can convert that into a

746
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,080
conditional access policy or just block

747
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
some ips things like that some of the

748
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,399
sas applications support that

749
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,840
so that's it for logins i'm going to run

750
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,280
through a few of these and then kind of

751
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
kind of wrap up and you know hopefully

752
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,158
we're

753
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,520
we're not too far over time um so the

754
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
other thing to look at is access and

755
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,600
privilege changes right so

756
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,799
who's getting new privilege i mean that

757
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,480
should be rare enough in your

758
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,840
environment that it should be an alert

759
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,280
every time it happens but again if

760
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,799
you're not already alerting on it

761
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,960
can you go into your environment and

762
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
look for certain events like add member

763
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
to role

764
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,960
in microsoft and then go see what's

765
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
what's being give

766
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
user and sometimes they'll give you some

767
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,799
extended json extended properties etc

768
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,679
where you can dive into more of the

769
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,799
details and

770
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,919
and that kind of thing and this is one

771
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,039
of the areas where you have to start to

772
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
get a little bit comfortable with some

773
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,840
of these different logs

774
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,280
and and understand but usually you can

775
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,799
start to pull out like what's what's

776
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,639
going on here and then again if you can

777
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,320
convert that into a detection rule

778
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,760
never do it again like never hunt for

779
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
the same thing twice right i think you

780
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,158
know

781
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
hopefully you can quote me on that um

782
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,919
but uh you know that's

783
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
i think that's something to look for and

784
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,480
if you look at something like g suite

785
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,918
they often have quite a bit of

786
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,799
information around this

787
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,440
uh where users are created users are

788
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,360
maybe given

789
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,799
licenses or deleted or things like that

790
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,000
but you know certainly if they're given

791
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,400
extra roles uh you want to uh you want

792
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
to

793
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,360
you know look for that you want to go

794
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,639
hunt for that and then in g suite they

795
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
actually have some detection rules you

796
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
can turn on

797
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,480
that will email you last i checked it'll

798
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
only email the admins which is kind of a

799
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,080
deficiency because a lot of times the

800
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
security team is not the admin of these

801
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,360
apps you're sort of at the mercy of the

802
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,200
application owner

803
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,799
um but at least you know if users

804
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,159
granted admin privilege that kind of

805
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,440
thing they could get an alert and then

806
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,400
you don't ever have to hunt for this

807
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,520
again you just sort of

808
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
get told when this happens right um so

809
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,960
what you care about like of course new

810
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,000
privilege is granted this should be rare

811
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
enough that you should

812
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,080
flag every single time from a detection

813
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
rule but again if you're not hunting for

814
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,678
it right now

815
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,840
go hunt for that like immediately

816
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,240
removal of privilege access too this is

817
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,918
often just something good to check on

818
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
was this a person departing were they

819
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,240
changing job functions was it an

820
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
adversary who's

821
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,000
trying to remove privileges from the

822
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,360
global admins or things like that

823
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,960
and then if there's you know maybe some

824
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
other things like mailbox delegation

825
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
like

826
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,959
if i'm given delegation rights to the

827
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,158
ceo

828
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
i don't actually have to log in as the

829
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
ceo i log in as myself and then i can go

830
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,600
read the ceo's email or send email on

831
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,960
his or her behalf right

832
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,639
and then can you correlate some of this

833
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,320
stuff maybe to the source of truth like

834
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,000
the hr system and that kind of thing

835
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,439
and really keep an eye on contractors

836
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
consultants and service providers you

837
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
know you might see an mssp come into an

838
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,279
environment

839
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,639
and then they add a bunch of admin

840
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,080
accounts and things like that nothing

841
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
trying to be malicious but it

842
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,678
it maybe doesn't have necessarily the

843
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,120
best hygiene uh and then contractors

844
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,600
come and go and are there accounts kind

845
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
of left

846
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,879
left behind so you know just go hunt for

847
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
this stuff it's not necessarily saying

848
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,159
this is full on

849
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,600
you know adversarial trying to you know

850
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
compromise you left right and center

851
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,240
it's just

852
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
hey this is this is stuff we see all the

853
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,960
time and companies really care about

854
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
this because

855
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
you want to reduce your risk and you

856
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,439
might have compliance requirements and

857
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,799
things like that

858
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,559
uh and then when you look at admin

859
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,158
activity i mean this is always good just

860
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,520
to go in and look at the post login

861
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,720
admin activity like

862
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,320
what are people doing and some of it

863
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,640
overlaps with what i just talked about

864
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
but

865
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,960
you know our new users being created

866
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,480
suspended is data being copied from one

867
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
account to another which you know

868
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
usually the admins can do especially if

869
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,000
an account is suspended where did that

870
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,400
account's data go

871
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,679
um you know so go go looking for that

872
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
right that's that's kind of the stuff

873
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,799
that that i would say go look at right

874
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
away if you're not already kind of

875
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,240
doing some flagging and analysis of this

876
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
stuff

877
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
and if you go into something like

878
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,000
dropbox or box they actually give you a

879
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,080
lot of

880
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,919
a lot of verbose activity the one thing

881
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,000
i don't love about these

882
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,279
applications is that you kind of have to

883
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,039
know what you're looking for

884
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,200
so on the left side i have to literally

885
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,200
um add a whole bunch of

886
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,799
different kinds of data that i think are

887
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,799
all sort of admin data

888
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
and then i can export the logs or you

889
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,240
know kind of go look at it

890
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,840
um and same kind of on the on the right

891
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,840
side uh with

892
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,678
um i'm forgetting which one's box and

893
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,439
dropbox now i apologize but

894
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,720
um the whole point is like they have

895
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
some really good data it's a little bit

896
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
tricky to get to it

897
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,720
because you have to know kind of what

898
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,080
you're looking for but it's it's it's

899
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,799
pretty cool once you start to pull the

900
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,559
logs

901
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,960
so the data's there you just gotta go

902
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,080
kind of looking through it

903
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
and so what should you care about when

904
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,039
it comes to some of this admin activity

905
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,918
well provisioning and deep provisioning

906
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,400
of accounts

907
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,000
not necessarily anything nefarious there

908
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
but changing settings right i mean this

909
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,799
can be huge if all of a sudden someone

910
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,279
flips a switch

911
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,120
and mfa is no longer required for 100

912
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,559
000 employees

913
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,639
i would want to know about that again

914
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,720
that should be a detection rule but

915
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,320
we understand also it's hard to you know

916
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,679
maybe have detection rules and all these

917
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,439
different systems

918
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
and you know so can you go hunt for this

919
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,360
kind of activity uh and then user level

920
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,918
activity from an admin account what do i

921
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,439
mean well

922
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,480
you should have the separation of duty

923
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
right you should have the admin that

924
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,520
does

925
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,719
admin stuff and then that same human

926
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,918
should have a user level account that

927
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
does everything else

928
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,600
and what we see far too often is the

929
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,840
admin account

930
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,039
is doing all sorts of user level stuff

931
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
like checking email

932
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,919
and getting phished and all these other

933
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
things and it's like just break them

934
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,440
apart so go look for that

935
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,039
are you seeing you know admin accounts

936
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,640
do a lot of user level activity because

937
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
that's that should be a quick win

938
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,400
you know very quick win uh and then as

939
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,080
anyone granting themselves access to

940
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
resources to mailboxes

941
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
this could be insider threat this could

942
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,399
be an external adversary that

943
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,840
compromised wanted to get access to some

944
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
other things

945
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
and so really this is just a great area

946
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
to go looking for you know threats and

947
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,080
or

948
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,720
mistakes do a quick time check here

949
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
okay um and then you know broadly shared

950
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,159
files and that kind of thing

951
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
a lot of a lot of these systems the

952
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
whole point of them is to share files or

953
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,480
to share

954
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,158
content of some sort so if you go into

955
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,679
something like g suite you can actually

956
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,159
start to create filters

957
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,880
and go hunting through the data around

958
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,799
you know

959
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,039
what files were internal only that were

960
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,200
then exposed and changed to external

961
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,960
sharing right because that tends to be a

962
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,919
huge concern for companies is who's

963
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
sharing files

964
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,080
externally maybe internally sort of fair

965
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,320
game to share whoever

966
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,760
needs it but externally maybe it's not

967
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,360
you know allowed from

968
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,279
policy from compliance reasons whatever

969
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,600
but it's usually not prevented

970
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,440
in the application itself so who's you

971
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,799
know sharing things publicly on the web

972
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,559
or with a link that doesn't have a

973
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
password or things like that so

974
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,158
go in there and you know start to dive

975
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
in and hunt and by the way i realize

976
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,760
this is pretty different than looking

977
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,360
for

978
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,960
you know kind of yara rules or other

979
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,039
things in binaries but this is the

980
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
reality of sas as you're looking at

981
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,240
more kind of account based behavior and

982
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,080
that kind of thing

983
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,760
and trying to find both threats and risk

984
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,120
and you know really try to try to

985
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,000
get to a better place and then oauth

986
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,199
applications

987
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,480
uh you know it's it's incredible

988
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,120
how much power our user populations get

989
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,320
with oauth applications uh or at least

990
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,559
the ability to

991
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
install oauth applications so if you're

992
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
not familiar with it right you've

993
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,158
probably

994
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,080
are not familiar with maybe the the

995
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,679
terminology a lot of us have probably

996
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
logged into a different web app and said

997
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,039
hey this app's requesting

998
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,480
access to your you know google drive or

999
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,919
your you know just just your email

1000
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,080
details or whatever

1001
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,159
and we say yes well sometimes this is

1002
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,840
like hey this is requesting access to

1003
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,200
just like i said your entire google

1004
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,799
drive

1005
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
you click that now it can see all the

1006
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,679
files right

1007
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,439
even files people are sharing with you

1008
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
and stuff like that so um

1009
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,559
you know it depends on the scopes and

1010
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,279
you know permissions and things like

1011
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,799
that but

1012
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,880
this is just a massive area that is ripe

1013
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,639
for abuse it's not really called out

1014
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,440
enough um and

1015
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,840
it's it's a nice way for adversaries to

1016
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,320
get around multi-factor authentication

1017
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,678
because if i fish you and you have mfa i

1018
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,439
have to get through the mfa

1019
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
process and you know sort of trick you

1020
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,200
to give me mfa tokens and you know try

1021
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,799
to get a maybe a different mfa factor so

1022
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
that i can get back in if i get kicked

1023
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
out

1024
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
whereas if i just send you a message and

1025
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,440
saying hey you're invited to this brand

1026
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,159
new google drive

1027
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
uh you know beta click here to give me

1028
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,919
access to your account

1029
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,600
i have that oauth token i'm good like i

1030
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,960
don't i don't need to even really log in

1031
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,199
as you i can just go perform

1032
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,559
actions as you um and sometimes you can

1033
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,159
grant access on behalf of your whole

1034
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,320
company and things like that so

1035
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,440
this is really an area to focus on and

1036
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,480
it's not just things like

1037
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,080
like um microsoft and g suite

1038
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,799
it's uh you know these are some

1039
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,799
screenshots from from slack from zoom

1040
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,080
where you can add uh different

1041
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,879
applications

1042
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,918
and you know like who's adding what into

1043
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
your

1044
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,600
slack like what what have you

1045
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,000
contractually said

1046
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,678
you would allow in your slack and what

1047
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
kind of data cause we all know slack is

1048
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,799
often used to discuss maybe a customer

1049
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,080
issue a product bug

1050
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,720
those kinds of things where you might be

1051
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
sharing snippets of of literally like

1052
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,840
you know something that's that's quite

1053
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,640
sensitive well this person over here

1054
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,959
just installed this

1055
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
chess game i've seen all this stuff this

1056
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
chess game which is

1057
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,360
made by some developer who has no

1058
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,039
credentials and no you know

1059
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,639
haven't really been authorized maybe

1060
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,399
there's nothing bad but like

1061
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
you start to very quickly get uneasy

1062
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,520
about how fast your data could be

1063
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
flowing out and going to other countries

1064
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,879
or you know just at least get

1065
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,199
people in scope that really shouldn't be

1066
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,480
in scope um and so just being aware of

1067
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,000
these third-party apps and so if you

1068
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,720
have access to something like zoom or

1069
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,480
slack

1070
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,039
in some sort of privileged capacity you

1071
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,600
can go review what people have added

1072
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,039
and really dive in there right and so if

1073
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,320
you're thinking about sharing

1074
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,080
um you know what should you care about

1075
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,918
well sensitive scopes and grants like if

1076
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,559
you're adding an app that has full gmail

1077
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
access

1078
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,158
or you know similar um sharing

1079
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,600
externally with no password i would go

1080
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,919
look for those kinds of

1081
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,959
kinds of activities uh no password or

1082
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,520
restrictions like

1083
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,960
you know um you know so maybe it has an

1084
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,480
expiration but no password or maybe it

1085
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,679
has a password so that's cool but

1086
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,440
just going to look for some of that

1087
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
stuff and then the system level stuff

1088
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,559
hey this is granted access to

1089
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
everybody's mailbox right um okay maybe

1090
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,799
that's intended

1091
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,959
maybe it's like an email defense or

1092
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,799
something but you you

1093
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,399
it should be rare enough that go find it

1094
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,600
and then convert it into a detection

1095
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,239
rule right

1096
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,158
and then often we see things like

1097
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
sensitive access was granted by an app

1098
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,159
and only one person out of a hundred

1099
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,480
thousand

1100
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,240
is using that app okay might be fine but

1101
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
like go look at it right go look at it

1102
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,279
that's risk

1103
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,799
and then a few more things like users

1104
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,440
just adding applications

1105
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,879
to you know slack salesforce huge one

1106
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,679
zoom

1107
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,360
one thing that quite frankly scared me a

1108
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,679
lot the other day was when i realized

1109
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,559
that

1110
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
users can create shared channels between

1111
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,639
slacks

1112
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,000
right so if you're not familiar you have

1113
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,360
your slack you have someone other

1114
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,080
company slack they added this cool

1115
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,678
feature

1116
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,199
where you can create like a pipe between

1117
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,919
the two so everyone just logs into their

1118
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,039
own slack

1119
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,960
but now you have the shared channel

1120
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,720
between the two

1121
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,480
you can actually just accept shared

1122
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,360
channels as a regular

1123
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,799
user and now all of a sudden like other

1124
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,639
people in your company could get added

1125
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,080
to this slack and now maybe there's data

1126
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,919
flowing out to this whole

1127
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,039
other company and there's no admins

1128
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,760
involved and things like that so that

1129
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,519
scared me the other day when i saw that

1130
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,200
external sharing to domains like yahoo

1131
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,640
and gmail and stuff like that or you

1132
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,840
know mail forwarding rules or sharing

1133
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
files that kind of thing

1134
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,039
um and then something you know i think

1135
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,760
sans did a great job of of

1136
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,519
sharing their iocs with the recent you

1137
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,360
know kind of phishing attack and stuff

1138
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,039
um but you know applications that maybe

1139
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,158
manipulate mailbox to insert mail

1140
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,279
forwarding rules or other things where

1141
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,919
you're starting to combine stuff i'm

1142
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,600
talking about

1143
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,279
can you go look for that can you go see

1144
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,120
okay who who added this mail forwarding

1145
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,919
rule oh as an app that's really weird

1146
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,678
okay let me go

1147
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,279
you know sort of dive in and kind of see

1148
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,559
what's going on there so

1149
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,880
just a lot of stuff i know i'm throwing

1150
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,399
a lot at you happy to talk more offline

1151
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,320
or you know catch up some other time as

1152
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,279
well if anyone wants more details on any

1153
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,399
of these things but

1154
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,080
just trying to get you to think about

1155
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,719
some of these things because i know sort

1156
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
of sass

1157
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,919
hunting and detection and that kind of

1158
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,720
thing is is not usually on everyone's

1159
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,320
mind because we

1160
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,640
we all grew up in this sort of endpoint

1161
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,120
network and uh other areas of the tech

1162
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
stack

1163
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,279
uh type of hunting and and response

1164
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,760
so um i briefly touched on this which

1165
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,720
was

1166
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,279
really the totality of threats and then

1167
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,640
to me

1168
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,559
again we all have our own definitions

1169
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,919
but to me detection is going to get you

1170
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,760
some of the way hopefully

1171
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,600
99 but let's be real it's it's never 99

1172
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,600
um it's going to get you some of the way

1173
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,240
there and then the rest of it you get to

1174
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,240
go hunt

1175
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
and then tune and care and feed and you

1176
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,000
know improve automated processes so

1177
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
you're not always hunting

1178
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,799
and you know just really thinking about

1179
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,919
it like that at least that's how i think

1180
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,679
about it

1181
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,120
and then you know giving you a few tips

1182
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,399
to sort of take away pick an application

1183
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,039
like each one of these they have

1184
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,000
different logs different uis

1185
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,039
quite frankly the security team does not

1186
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,279
usually have

1187
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,799
access to the app it's the app owner

1188
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,279
maybe it's it maybe it's

1189
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,158
hr owns workday or sales team owns

1190
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,600
salesforce

1191
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,960
you know that kind of thing so you're

1192
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,000
gonna have to figure out how to get

1193
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,399
access

1194
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,679
if you can pull telemetry out so that

1195
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,360
you don't have to worry about being

1196
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,120
in their ui because those application

1197
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,639
owners are very concerned with uptime

1198
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
and availability as they should be

1199
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,000
can you get telemetry out so that maybe

1200
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,639
you can do your enrichment or you know

1201
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,839
do some

1202
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,119
some improvements so you're not just

1203
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,879
looking at ips you're actually doing

1204
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,480
geolocation or things like that

1205
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,319
i would just say like who's logging in

1206
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760
from outside the countries you expect

1207
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,879
sounds so simple but it's hard

1208
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,480
in sas can you go look at that go look

1209
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,319
at who's logging in from other countries

1210
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,000
you didn't expect

1211
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,919
then look at privileged activity you

1212
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
know shared files third-party apps

1213
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,199
and then once you start to get

1214
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,960
comfortable with that then there's this

1215
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,399
whole set of data that i haven't really

1216
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
even gone into which is just kind of the

1217
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,199
post login activity

1218
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,119
like the hundreds of different events

1219
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,678
that you'll do as you you know

1220
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,119
just use onedrive and sharepoint and

1221
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,480
google docs and all these other things

1222
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,240
like there's just a lot of different

1223
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,918
you know events you can start to see and

1224
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,439
dive into um

1225
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,199
but if you haven't already looked at

1226
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,560
things like logins and admins and you

1227
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,040
know shared files and things like that

1228
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
then

1229
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,279
you know you're probably missing some of

1230
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,880
the key you know roi and wins there

1231
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,480
and there's some gutches though right

1232
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,200
and i kind of mentioned the gotcha

1233
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,240
of getting the data uh my number one

1234
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,839
surprise

1235
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,279
straight up my number one surprise were

1236
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,920
about almost four years into the

1237
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,119
obsidian you know as a company journey

1238
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,200
my number one surprise was how

1239
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,440
disconnected security and the sort of

1240
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,118
application owners often are

1241
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,720
right so security now has to come to the

1242
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,640
table and you know kind of get a seat

1243
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,040
and access and that kind of thing so

1244
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,319
if you can navigate that get the data

1245
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,759
try to figure out how you can do it

1246
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,040
maybe even audit logging or things like

1247
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,640
that weren't turned on

1248
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,119
go check immediately you don't want to

1249
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,400
get an ir tomorrow and the ir firm says

1250
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,720
sorry you didn't have any logging turned

1251
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,720
on you know that that happens a lot

1252
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,799
um and then where to begin right i

1253
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,040
suggest where a lot of your population

1254
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,599
sits so microsoft 365 or g

1255
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,400
suite tends to have a huge number of

1256
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,320
users

1257
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,760
doing all sorts of crazy stuff even if

1258
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,000
you're like 100 employees

1259
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
in your company um so i would go look at

1260
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,359
that um and then

1261
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,520
there are these other tricks that will

1262
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,960
get you i promise they will get you if

1263
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,520
you don't think about it

1264
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,960
you might do something in sharepoint and

1265
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,320
microsoft is like

1266
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,760
hey i'm just going to run that query

1267
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,440
over in brazil for you even though

1268
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,520
you're in california

1269
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,000
it's it's i i don't know all the reasons

1270
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,680
why but you'll see events all over the

1271
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,800
world sometimes even if your people

1272
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,319
aren't there so you have to start to

1273
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,680
figure out like well is this microsoft

1274
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,040
running it in a data center

1275
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,640
on behalf of the user or things like

1276
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,920
that it's not just microsoft but uh

1277
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,879
calling that out

1278
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,800
and then you might have to stitch

1279
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,560
together account ids so it's like hey

1280
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,920
account id one two three four did this

1281
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,640
action and then you have to go look at

1282
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,560
okay which

1283
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,240
user in the inventory is account id one

1284
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,520
two three four so if you can start to

1285
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,200
you know stitch that together a little

1286
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
bit yourself or just have a have a way

1287
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,759
of

1288
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,800
of resolving that um you might have to

1289
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
do some of that stuff

1290
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,760
and then just you know probably what

1291
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
you're already doing in some other hunts

1292
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,240
take

1293
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
the most common events and just exclude

1294
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,879
them right and then start to narrow down

1295
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,119
to a much more

1296
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,800
kind of rare set of events you're gonna

1297
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,280
find some really interesting stuff going

1298
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
on

1299
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,040
um and then things like automated jobs

1300
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,800
or third-party apps you know the oauth

1301
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
apps they can be incredibly noisy like

1302
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,640
the

1303
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,079
the whole you know i'm gonna log into

1304
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,520
everyone's email box and look at every

1305
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,720
single email for phishing and stuff like

1306
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
that those are gonna generate

1307
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,078
millions of events so can you filter

1308
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,440
some of that stuff out right so that's

1309
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,880
just another gotcha

1310
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,119
and then um i i mostly mostly

1311
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,800
kind of mention this throughout but it's

1312
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,680
not just about finding the adversary i

1313
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,920
mean yes it is

1314
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680
about that first and foremost but you

1315
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,880
know every time you do a hunt

1316
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,919
can you find gaps weaknesses etc that

1317
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,000
either

1318
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,040
you know if you fix it excuse me just

1319
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,599
went through puberty there

1320
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,880
if you fix it um would would slow the

1321
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,480
attacker down more you know basically

1322
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,079
harden your environment more get rid of

1323
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,000
basic authentication because that

1324
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,480
doesn't require mfa et cetera

1325
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,680
can you uh speed your defenders up oh

1326
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,119
man if i just you know change the

1327
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,399
setting i'm gonna have better telemetry

1328
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,760
better you know better incident response

1329
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,240
better triage

1330
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,520
or hey i'm seeing all this activity uh

1331
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,200
can i go back to

1332
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
the population and say hey guys we

1333
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,399
really gotta start using passwords in

1334
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
file sharing or these you know

1335
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,839
just encourage good behavior or

1336
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,160
discourage bad behavior so can you start

1337
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,000
to

1338
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,598
you know kind of get all these outcomes

1339
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,280
as you're you're doing your hunt because

1340
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
it's such a valuable time

1341
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,280
you want to learn as much as possible

1342
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,119
sas is here

1343
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,440
we get tons of apps you know i think

1344
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,240
this is probably even outdated now but

1345
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,960
you know back back in 2019 18 employees

1346
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,040
would mean that you already had 81 apps

1347
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,040
it's just an explosion right explosion

1348
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,920
of apps

1349
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,800
and oops i have a wrong logo here so i

1350
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
apologize but

1351
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,520
um otherwise uh thank you i don't know

1352
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,800
if we have time for questions but uh

1353
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,320

1354
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,520
bit and would love to stay in touch with

1355
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,720
