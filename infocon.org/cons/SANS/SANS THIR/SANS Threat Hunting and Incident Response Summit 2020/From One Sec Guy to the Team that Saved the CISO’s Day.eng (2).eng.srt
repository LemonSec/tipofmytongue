1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,040
um i'm

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
excited for the next one glad to

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,000
introduce you to uh diego mariano

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,759
who is at as you can see here uh albert

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
einstein hospital but what i'm also

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,199
interested in is

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,240
he's got an interesting background that

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
uh includes

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
banging as well and he's going to be

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
talking specifically about

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,400
uh you know kind of growing to a a

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
capability that uh you know benefits the

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,679
cso saves the cso's day as he's gotten a

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,558
title here

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,920
but kind of showing how those uh small

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,919
progressions that you can make

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
end up being very tactically beneficial

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,559
and then grow into a strategic benefit

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
as well

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,800
so um that said uh glad to have you here

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
with us he is actually coming to us from

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,239
uh sao paulo brazil which is pretty cool

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,160
i believe this is

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,440
one of our first presenters from south

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,919
america we had one or two

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,519
uh that were in person last year and i

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
believe the year prior but first one

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,680
coming to us are virtually

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,879
from uh from south america but that said

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
uh diego welcome

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,960
and uh thanks for sharing your time and

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,080
your your findings with us

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,960
yeah thank you phil so my name is diego

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
mariano

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,640
i'm from brazil and it's a pleasure for

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,679
me to be

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,040
to be here currently i'm the chief

38
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,799
security officer at

39
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
opting hospital uh opt eisen is one of

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,840
the biggest hospital in the world

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,479
with almost 20 000 employees

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
and working the health healthcare field

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
is a new challenge for me

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
all maokai here was made on financial

45
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,799
institution

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,320
and to make marisma worse i started

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
working there only six months

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,000
ago exactly at the same time the global

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,079
pandemic

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,920
also starts so it has been crazy

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,679
during the pandemic advent of my studies

52
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,640
of yoga for example

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,240
playing bensuri is an flute and

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
speaking sanskrit

55
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,640
an ancient indian language so i

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,079
challenged myself to use some central

57
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
terms in this talk

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
i'm sure you'll notice when a word in

59
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
sanskrit appears

60
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,079
and the word i will not play than siri

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,119
the experience that i am going to share

62
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,519
today happened

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,239
at my former job at a huge financial

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,840
institution

65
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,840
around 90 000 employees at that time i

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
was a security engineer manager

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
responsible for the reddit team

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,920
vulnerability management program

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,959
application security operations and also

70
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,079
to create

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,720
a new threats hunting team

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
we started this adventure with only one

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,959
junior security engineer

74
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,840
and my goal today is to share what we

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,000
have learned on the hard way

76
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,040
okay let's go

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,599
what are our goals so what i'm going to

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,560
focus

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,238
is more about people and process and

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
just some important techniques

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
the intention here is not to bring new

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,640
techniques but new ways of dealing with

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,399
process and people to implement these

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,958
already know techniques

85
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
it is not about specific technology are

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
two

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
or the most important it is a viewpoint

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
on how to fail

89
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,760
fast and small we are humans right so we

90
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,920
are going to fail

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,200
at some time so let's fail fast small

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
and learn with our failures

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,720
so how did we start

94
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,799
just for registration i brought the

95
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,560
information security structure that was

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
divided into four major

97
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
areas security architecture security

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
governance

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
security project stock and internet

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,238
response team

101
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,799
and finally security engineering where

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,360
threat hunting was born

103
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,480
all of this start with a simple request

104
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,519
from the boss

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,518
let's do threat hunting and that's it no

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,480
additional money to the engineers or

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,239
any kind of resource at that time was

108
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,079
there was no reference and no

109
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,799
benchmarking about threat hunting in

110
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
brazil

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,799
no one was focused on this if i asked to

112
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,679
someone

113
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
if they are doing hunting the answer was

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
yes

115
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
i have one analyst in my operation

116
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,239
center that in his free time he does

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,920
some alert optimization and false

118
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,120
positive analysis

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,280
yeah that's true so

120
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
let's start from the beginning what is

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,040
it how do we hunting how are what are

122
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,599
the tools

123
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,478
where do we start at the most important

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,399
question

125
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:22,800
is why why hunting why are we doing this

126
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,679
i'm emphasizing the why question because

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
as soon you

128
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,600
see in this talk it is the most

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
important question when dealing with

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
people

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,960
and building new teams so

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,520
right now we are at the i don't know

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,159
what adobe phase it's a good phase

134
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,799
though

135
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
because we are happy and motivated on

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
starting a new journey

137
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,000
and we still don't know the size of the

138
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
habits that we are entering

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,639
so phase one the first thing is to

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
define team indicators to monitor

141
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
process what are our threat hunting

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
process

143
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,320
or how many of them are implemented data

144
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,840
services

145
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,840
what are and where are our data first

146
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,080
are are we using out of we have

147
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,159
knowledge

148
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
what do we have to learn and how much we

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,400
know about that

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,880
interaction with other teams we are

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,280
neither

152
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,719
inside the security operation center nor

153
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,039
incident response team

154
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
so have to meet and talk with different

155
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
people

156
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,719
strategic influence how much value are

157
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,840
we generating to our company

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,960
how to quantify value confidence

159
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,280
how confident are we with this journey

160
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,000
so at phase one we have nothing but

161
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
confidence

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
a lot of confidence i would say

163
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
so we start learning things the phase

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,199
one we focus

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
on learning what is and how to implement

166
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
threat hunting

167
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,479
we learn all the great stuff about

168
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,359
hunting loop hunting maturity level

169
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,719
pyramid of pain and so on some of these

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,440
great researchers are now

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
archiving david's bianco's site

172
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,360
threadhunting.net

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
squirrel was a threatening hunting

174
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,840
platform vendor at that time

175
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
with an usually strong focus on teaching

176
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,599
the cyber security committee

177
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,199
about threat hunting best practice they

178
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
published it somewhat

179
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
are still foundational documents about

180
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,680
trade hunting

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
when their website finally went offline

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
they've been committed the documents

183
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
from their website

184
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
okay

185
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,280
so activities so how how did we use the

186
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
recent

187
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,119
acquired knowledge and first

188
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,479
thing always we defined three basic

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,880
indicators

190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,120
number of findings different types of

191
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
findings and failed tools

192
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,919
because these three indicators reflect

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,039
exactly the definition of threat hunting

194
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,198
rates

195
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,240
what we found and which tools have

196
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
failed

197
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
second important thing to implement use

198
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,479
case hypothesis

199
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,240
in an iterative and azure process to

200
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
fail small and learn fast

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,280
you must have a process that will help

202
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,159
you accomplish

203
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,479
this goal the software engineering teams

204
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,360
are already mature with azure process

205
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,199
and it works right so let's use it in

206
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
our favor

207
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,960
the user cases we used are also from the

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
lesbian construction hunting project

209
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,638
and we found this phrase of sergio

210
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,440
caltagillo and he's saying

211
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,319
that hunting is the most expensive a

212
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,160
difficult

213
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:32,160
strategy endeavor it's really scared us

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,720
but let's move on and maybe in

215
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
you have noticed i put here two sanskrit

216
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,199
words

217
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,318
the first one is the picture meaning the

218
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
ability to absorb

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
discomfort and the other is tapas

220
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,159
meaning discipline they are two

221
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,479
fundamental skills for anyone who wants

222
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
to build something from scratch

223
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,400
the ability to absorb discomfort and

224
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,560
this plan to maintain the pace

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,400
especially in dark times

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,039
what did we find in on phase one

227
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,039
actually we really found something and

228
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,840
we were so excited about that

229
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,159
because we thought that was an attacker

230
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
right

231
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
look uh right here we are thinking about

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,799
hunting

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,840
works just like a funerary you see

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
yourself happy

235
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
when you find an attacker inside your

236
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,039
infrastructure

237
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,638
just like the fenrir is happy when

238
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,280
someone dies it's crazy right

239
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,279
but we just found some employees listen

240
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,039
to web radio station that is against the

241
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,080
information security police

242
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,679
yes it was pretty frustrating and

243
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
but it's not me that is not important

244
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,718
correct but it is boring

245
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,719
it's so boring

246
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
and what did we not find we did we

247
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,680
didn't find

248
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,640
any baseline of user behavior network

249
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,479
behavior or the environment disability

250
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,720
we learned that these things are the

251
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,720
basics of for hunting right but

252
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
inside huge companies it's pretty

253
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
difficult to do

254
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,160
anything so this was a big problem

255
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,399
and we had to deal with that

256
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,399
how can we hunting without disability

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
so right now we already learned a lot of

258
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,399
things we have

259
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,719
a lot of problems we breathe we have

260
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,600
interaction only with incident response

261
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
team to inform

262
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
what employees are listening to radio

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
stations during work time

264
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
we have some hunting procedures but no

265
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,439
baselines

266
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,680
we only have access to one data source

267
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
right now the team is composed with one

268
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,560
junior engineer

269
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,160
and a part-time senior engineer okay

270
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:50,319
and most important what did we learn

271
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,959
we learned to understand our system you

272
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,640
we must change it we didn't find

273
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,839
anything's line

274
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,760
we got just one data source so let's be

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
more aggressive and let's change the

276
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,040
system

277
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,160
good hypothesis require experience in

278
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,199
the contest

279
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,640
the reference material is really great

280
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,720
but you have to know yourself how do i

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,040
make it into a process for others to

282
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,040
follow

283
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,000
some ideas let's get closer to the

284
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,640
security monitoring

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,839
team let's review the rules that they

286
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,360
already have

287
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,839
this was a high risk decision because

288
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,200
we would start doing a job that was not

289
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,240
hunting but we need experience in the

290
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,480
contest

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
we must understand the system and we

292
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
must interact

293
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
with more teams especially the security

294
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,560
operations teams

295
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,320
so we made this decision

296
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,479
from now on at the end of the falling

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,440
phase i'm going to focus just on

298
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,320
interaction

299
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,839
what did we learn and ideas okay because

300
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
these topics are more relevant to

301
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
overcome obstacles

302
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,279
and the resulting are more hunting

303
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,440
procedures and better cells

304
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,240
right now we have new problems new ideas

305
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,240
so let's move to the next phase

306
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,320
phase two we increase it

307
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
a little bit in the indicators of

308
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,839
process data sources

309
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
knowledge and interaction zero strategic

310
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,160
influence

311
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,360
but no problem with that right now

312
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,160
look something really interesting

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
happened with the team's confidence that

314
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
dropped

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,040
through approximately zero why that

316
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
yesterday we were happy

317
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,439
confident and motivated and today we are

318
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
desperate and believing that there is no

319
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,000
line at the end of the tunnel

320
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:46,399
let me explain what happened

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,120
the donald kruger effect that's a

322
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,800
strange word but and while anyone here

323
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
already has heard about

324
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,359
the danny kruger effect in short the

325
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,079
paper says that

326
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
a person's confidence in a given subject

327
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,800
does not necessarily reflect

328
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,279
his or her competence or

329
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
quote in charles darvin ignores more

330
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,120
frequent

331
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,519
begets confidence than thus knowledge

332
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,760
this work explain a lot of things and

333
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,399
not only about threat hunting

334
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,240
it does explain why we are so confident

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
when we are being with some

336
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,000
some friends about any subjects posted

337
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,399
on twitter or instagram

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
and it also explains why we all consider

339
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,440
ourselves pandemic

340
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,719
experts right now because when we don't

341
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
know

342
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
what we don't know we are confident with

343
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,800
subject

344
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
but when we start to study and know the

345
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,920
number of things that we don't know

346
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,040
about the subject

347
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,399
then our confidence drops this is not

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,519
so valuable because no eventual can be

349
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,760
prepared at the time i didn't know

350
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,680
anything about it so i was wondering

351
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,200
what am i doing wrong

352
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,920
why they lose confidence

353
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
right now that we know about

354
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,839
dunning-kruger effect

355
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,279
let's see how to deal with the lack of

356
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,320
confidence

357
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,399
so if you are doing the traditional

358
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,120
two-week sprint or no sprints at all

359
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,720
stop with that and start doing at least

360
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
one week sprint

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,720
to review the work in progress to make

362
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
necessary decisions

363
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,399
and maintain a straight communication

364
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,399
with the team including

365
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,680
when you don't know what next phrases

366
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,160
are

367
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,800
remember this plan to maintain the pace

368
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,279
and ability to absorb this comfort

369
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,279
let the system create its own rules the

370
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,199
word system here

371
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,439
is about the system we are living inside

372
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,040
the company all the process that exists

373
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,959
the people and the future

374
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,439
so do not want to define any control of

375
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,518
the rules let the system create them

376
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
let the team create them focus on the

377
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,959
defined goals

378
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,920
why they are important and what are the

379
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
constraints

380
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,000
and not the rules for the team the

381
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
further to the team define

382
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
its own rules is great right but it's

383
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,199
not energy

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,439
that's why it's important to define the

385
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,880
constraints the boundary as far as the

386
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,839
team can go

387
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,600
so according to the agile manifesto

388
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,199
simplicity is the article

389
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,760
of maximizing the amount of work not on

390
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,560
it's incredible phrase the best

391
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,639
architectures

392
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,399
requirements and designs emerge from

393
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,760
self-organizing teams

394
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,240
so it could be the best hypothesis

395
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
and hunting platform emerge from

396
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,440
self-organizing teams

397
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,439
right why not

398
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,319
so let's start with phase two

399
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,680
first thing additional indicators and

400
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
now more realistic

401
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,279
indicators to monitor number of created

402
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
rules

403
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,240
number of false positives number of

404
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,160
generated alerts

405
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,920
we continue with the same philosophy

406
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
here iterative process

407
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,120
displaying and ability to absorb its

408
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,120
comfort

409
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,800
we started working with security

410
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
operations teams reviewing existing

411
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,560
rules

412
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,599
and let's try something new let's

413
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,839
understand the tps of the meter attack

414
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
and learn about the meter attack the

415
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,600
team came up

416
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
with an idea regarding environment

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
visibility

418
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,720
let's use the number of data service

419
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
logs that we have

420
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
access compared to the number of

421
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,040
possible data servers described on

422
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,800
metatrack matrix

423
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,719
to have something more concrete about

424
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,319
visibility

425
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,639
where we are right now and where we

426
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,639
should be that was a great idea

427
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,560
so presentation of attack data service

428
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
this is a good reference about

429
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,239
prioritization of attack data search

430
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
from rate attack home

431
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,959
200 techniques required at least two

432
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,199
data sources to analyze them

433
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,959
at phase one we have just one data

434
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,479
source

435
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
with this strategy the number of

436
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,839
datasets we have access

437
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,040
compared to the number of possible

438
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,839
datasets we can show in a concrete way

439
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,839
the importance of more context and more

440
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
visibility

441
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
so moving on how to improve environment

442
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,519
visibility

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
along with this strategy we also found

444
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
something very useful

445
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,639
a talk from derbycon called better

446
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,279
network defense through threat injection

447
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,199
and hunting this is an excellent talk

448
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,160
because it helped us to respond to the

449
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,560
following questions

450
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,360
what's normal looks like where is our

451
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,638
baseline

452
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,480
where are we to where we must go i'm not

453
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
going into details right here but in

454
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
short

455
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,720
these talks show how threats are

456
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
injected into the environment to enable

457
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
the hunting team to improve their skill

458
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,319
sets

459
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
and validate the effectiveness of their

460
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
secured tooling

461
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,399
so we can use all the techniques of

462
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,519
meter attack to show exactly how good

463
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,920
or bad our threat hunting posture is and

464
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
what data sources monitoring or alerts

465
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
we are missing

466
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
one more will improve environment

467
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,160
visibility

468
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,079
using threat injection technique we

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,400
could build a visibility

470
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,959
level assessment right which techniques

471
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
with no detection and no logs at all

472
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,439
that have only local

473
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,640
logs logs only centralized but not

474
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
correlated

475
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,080
correlated logs but no alerts generated

476
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,639
alerts but no incidence response and

477
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,399
finally

478
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
us incident response this was a great

479
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
step

480
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,480
regarding disability on phase one we had

481
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,199
almost nothing

482
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,320
just proxy data and now we had a

483
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,120
framework

484
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,159
to do to deal with our main problem the

485
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,159
lack of visibility

486
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,760
so just finish phase two now we have

487
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
also interaction with the security

488
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,240
operations

489
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,360
team by revealing rooks we already have

490
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,160
some baselines

491
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,039
right now the team was composed of one

492
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,520
junior engineer

493
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
one trainee and a part-time senior

494
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,039
engineer

495
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,120
what did we learn environment visibility

496
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,960
through metric data source

497
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,600
security monitoring and incident

498
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,880
response teams visibility assessment

499
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,918
review rules and alerts really sucks

500
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,480
it is was not cool but was a fundamental

501
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,480
task

502
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,400
as we will see ahead we are not red team

503
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,400
we are doing threat injection with meter

504
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,600
attack techniques but we are limited

505
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,559
by our own skills of blue team right

506
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,480
hunting demands operational tasks as

507
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,639
long as you produce new hypothesis we

508
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,120
have to take care

509
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,760
of the old ones and also deal with false

510
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,959
positives and so on

511
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,840
some new ideas what if we get closer to

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,360
the red team to help us on threat

513
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,959
injection let's show them the concept of

514
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,840
atomic red theme

515
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,280
can we delegate the operational tasks

516
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,559
just a question that arose

517
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,559
i will talk about it later

518
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,240
so yeah maybe there is light at the end

519
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,559
of the tunnel

520
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,919
but we don't know yet if it is a train

521
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,600
or not

522
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,760
right now we have some considerable

523
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,320
advancing process data source

524
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
knowledge interaction and look we

525
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,520
already have some

526
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
strategic influence but because right

527
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,039
now we can tell

528
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,120
what the maturity levels of the security

529
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,559
operations and incident response teams

530
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,199
are

531
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
and what about confidence we regained

532
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,039
some confidence

533
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,240
because now the boss have some reason to

534
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,760
listen to us

535
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,760
and we can ask for what we need

536
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,840
and we ask for the part-time senior

537
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,840
engineer to be a full-time hunting

538
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
engineer

539
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,440
so the main problem at this phase

540
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,480
hunting demands operational tasks

541
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,080
so it's time to deal with the new

542
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,840
problem

543
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,439
they already heard about combat swing

544
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,199
lanes it's a simple

545
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
and yet powerful tool to do with

546
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
different kinds of tasks including

547
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,799
operational tasks

548
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,679
but attention here because the combo

549
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,158
must reflect

550
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,960
your process and not the other way

551
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,320
around

552
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,880
you must not adopt adapt your daily

553
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
process

554
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,159
to the to do doing the own traditional

555
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,399
bird

556
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,919
this is subtle but very important to

557
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,559
remember

558
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,440
in our case we define five swim lanes

559
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,440
with the respective efforts on each one

560
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
working platform with a time dedicated

561
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
to evolving our working platform new

562
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,600
hypothesis

563
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:47,840
soccer rules review yes we started this

564
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,480
now we must finish this release

565
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,360
hunting operations this is the only

566
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,000
swing lane

567
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,639
that is not as predictable as the others

568
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,039
right

569
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,360
because you don't know in advance what

570
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,280
will be the numbers of generated alerts

571
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,320
of your hunting rules already in

572
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,639
production

573
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
so you have to define and allocate some

574
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
time to use activity

575
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,520
and then monitor if you were right or

576
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,840
not

577
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,600
remember the sprints are only one week

578
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,678
long so you can deal with this pay

579
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,719
attention if the hunting operations are

580
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,360
consuming

581
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:23,360
more than fifty percent of your time you

582
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
have to review your false positive rates

583
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,600
threat intelligence with one more secure

584
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,919
engineer in turn

585
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,360
we start doing threat intelligence so we

586
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
allocated some time

587
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
for that

588
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,158
let's continue on hunting demands

589
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,840
operational tasks

590
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,000
how can we be better on the following

591
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,199
statements

592
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,400
hunt once then automates it's a common

593
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,440
phrase right now

594
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,600
but how can we be better let's use the

595
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,919
pyramid of value

596
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
we already know the pyramid of pain and

597
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,080
if you already heard about lean startup

598
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
concept

599
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,399
then you know about the minimum viable

600
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
product

601
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
to be better on how to once then

602
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
automate we must follow

603
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,639
the pyramid of value to build the

604
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,360
hunting rules

605
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,400
that work as planned available and

606
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,639
reliable

607
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
i can use it without difficult it's

608
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,280
convenient

609
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,280
delight to share it has personal meaning

610
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
you talk about the hypothesis you do to

611
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,360
your friends

612
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,039
you are proud about that so at this time

613
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
the hypothesis our rule is ready to

614
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,879
share

615
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,640
hey let's share with the monitoring team

616
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,039
and from our own they are responsible

617
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,120
for that

618
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,120
why not and this was a game changer

619
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,879
because now we are delegating work to

620
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,439
another team

621
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,280
and we already had revealed all the

622
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,480
security operations rules

623
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,840
so we were best friends right now it was

624
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,840
easy to share with them

625
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,479
yeah so so now

626
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,158
after phase two we are right to start

627
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,919
phase three first things first

628
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,880
indicators

629
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,880
number of tested techniques environment

630
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
visibility

631
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
shock and incident response team

632
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
visibility visibility by each meter

633
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,640
attack technique

634
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,480
visibility was the the word at this time

635
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
finally at this point we were donating

636
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,080
working to another team

637
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
the automated renting rules were sent to

638
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,240
the monitoring team

639
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,080
this phase we focused on working

640
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,679
together with the red team

641
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,000
i don't know if you remember but the

642
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,039
reddit team and threats hunting team had

643
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,280
the same manager

644
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,640
and that was a good thing to influence

645
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,039
the reddit team to share

646
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,039
its secrets it's so difficult to do that

647
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,760
so this talk is not about threat

648
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
intelligence but

649
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,840
it's worth to mention at this phase we

650
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,159
also put a new secret in turn to start

651
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,879
this

652
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,080
discipline at this time the holy theme

653
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
was composed by

654
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,279
four security engineers focused on

655
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,080
hunting and

656
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,679
threat intelligence to help us to answer

657
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,678
some questions regarding external

658
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
intelligence and how to correlate with

659
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,080
this

660
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:18,880
internal intelligence we were already

661
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:22,720
building on past phase

662
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,360
visibility action plan so at this time

663
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,320
with the threat injection in progress we

664
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,520
could define

665
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,879
action plan for each type of finding for

666
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
example

667
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
for no detection at all maybe we need to

668
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,799
buy new tools

669
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
or activated new operational system

670
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,320
events or even new

671
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,799
network package capture for just local

672
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,799
logs

673
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,320
let's send the logs to the scene or

674
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,520
create local rules

675
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,439
for centralized logs but no rules let's

676
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,240
create new correlation rules

677
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,600
or new hunting procedures for correlated

678
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,080
logs but all alerts

679
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,719
may be some fine tuning depending on

680
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,080
roles

681
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,400
logic or threshold for

682
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,158
alex generated but failed incident

683
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,360
response let's review the plan

684
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,039
or the playbook this type

685
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,840
of visibility gave us strangus and voice

686
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
with the board of directors and also

687
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,158
credibility

688
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,480
with other teams so it has it was a huge

689
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,480
step

690
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,039
we are finishing phase three and to

691
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,000
summarize

692
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,320
we built great interaction with red team

693
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,600
and

694
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,678
also with cyber security project team

695
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,399
because the defining action plan that i

696
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,559
just mentioned on the slide before

697
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
we are growing on hunting procedures and

698
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,960
data sources

699
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,679
most important always keep learning

700
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,039
we can generate work to another team we

701
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,279
can work together

702
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,200
with red team it's a good thing and

703
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,919
actually it was so fun

704
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,080
we can delegate operational tasks we can

705
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,520
influence on the maturity level of other

706
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,559
teams

707
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,679
and new ideas that have emerged and

708
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,960
what about threat hunting are we doing

709
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,679
tread hunting

710
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,679
so let's go back to the basics

711
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,240
remember the most important question

712
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,279
why are we doing this right

713
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,919
early on phase one we discovered that

714
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,120
good hypothesis required experience in

715
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,279
the context

716
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,879
and right now we have access to a bunch

717
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,919
of different data services

718
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,440
and teams that are responsible for that

719
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,440
and we know how to deal with them

720
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
to understand the system you must change

721
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,640
it and yes

722
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,199
we changed it a lot we put our fingers

723
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,279
on every cyber security teams

724
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,679
how do i make it into a process for

725
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,080
others to follow

726
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,760
becoming a best friend of everybody

727
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,760
helping other teams

728
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,720
and building hunting procedures are

729
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,720
rules that we love to share with others

730
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,039
so this is not a straight line

731
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,559
to evolve your hunting we had to

732
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,320
overcome some obstacles

733
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,399
through activities that were not

734
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,799
necessarily directly related to

735
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,200
hypothesis creation

736
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,879
but these activities really help the

737
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,240
team's maturity

738
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,240
and we are where we are right now

739
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,279
because of the path that we chose

740
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,399
so this was a just a reflection

741
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:38,159
to all the team understand if we were

742
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,158
on the right way or not

743
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:50,880
so let's move on phase 4 indicators

744
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,120
finally we discovered it is not a train

745
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,600
and we regained the confidence with a

746
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
lot of effort

747
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,480
as you can see we did great steps on

748
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,200
every area at this phase

749
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,080
attention to the confidence number it is

750
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,279
a good number

751
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,480
but it's not 10. that's normal because

752
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,960
right now we are being realistic and not

753
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,399
just

754
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,720
optimistic okay

755
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,959
so don't worry that's the last phase

756
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,279
that i'm going to talk today

757
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,240
now i am not talking just about

758
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,159
indicators

759
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
now i'm talking about working with

760
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,600
security governance team to monitor

761
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,480
and maintain these indicators

762
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,840
right some new educators at this point

763
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,559
number of running

764
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,720
action plans visibility increments after

765
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,720
some concluded activity

766
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,720
the main goal right now is to monitor

767
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,399
the enhancement of cyber security

768
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,799
posture

769
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,959
because our activities were influencing

770
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,918
a lot of people in different security

771
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,080
teams

772
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,960
and threat intelligence is an excellent

773
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,360
ally

774
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,080
that i recommended working together and

775
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,799
inside the hunting team

776
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,879
look to stretches phrase right now at

777
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,799
this time we almost can see it

778
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,799
because it's not so scary anymore

779
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,120
this phase can also be called automation

780
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,080
phase

781
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,840
it doesn't mean that you can experiment

782
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,918
some automation or machine learning

783
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,840
algorithms on earlier series

784
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,760
in fact you must experiment that

785
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,320
especially right now with a lot of tools

786
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,158
that

787
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,158
has embedded machine learning algorithms

788
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
but remember machine learning demands

789
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,240
high environment

790
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,080
and context knowledge to work well so be

791
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,679
careful to not lose important time and

792
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,678
focus here

793
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,360
so we started to automate some already

794
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,279
know

795
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,120
threat injection techniques to monitor

796
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,200
and ensure we are not going back with

797
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,918
the materials level

798
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,080
hunt once then automate becomes a rule

799
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,360
and we discover that data science skill

800
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,600
is a must

801
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,600
and for sure we are not data scientists

802
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,760
so we are we realize that this

803
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,480
is a netherlands work and we must be

804
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,240
on a continuous learning cycle at this

805
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,960
time we had a high influence

806
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,159
on cyber security strategy and what

807
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,279
happens

808
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,559
when any kind of incident happens the

809
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
boss comes to us

810
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,440
and asks why the threat hunting team did

811
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,080
not see that coming

812
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
so in the past we were worried about our

813
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,639
ability to generate

814
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,880
value and become visible to the boss

815
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,000
and right now we are worried because it

816
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,720
is so much pressure

817
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,600
coming from the boss we are always

818
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,520
evolving

819
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
and high technical skills or high

820
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,559
maturity level does not necessarily mean

821
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,520
we are happy

822
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,000
and motivated so pay attention remember

823
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,399
always

824
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,240
about the ability to absorb its comfort

825
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,239
and discipline to maintain the base

826
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,440
to summarize i would like to introduce a

827
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,480
simple framework

828
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,799
of learning cycles

829
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
everything that i talked here was my way

830
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,440
to pass through the problems

831
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
each one has its own way but for any

832
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,919
kind of world

833
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,000
do not forget these four things

834
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,480
cyber security is done through people

835
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,320
process built by people and not only

836
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,880
tools and techniques

837
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,840
define your methodology together with

838
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,799
the team

839
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,480
preferably using the failed small and

840
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,799
fast mindset

841
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,720
every engineer needs a platform to work

842
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,840
so you must guarantee

843
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,799
they have time to build it communication

844
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,000
and interaction

845
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,639
inside and outside the team threat

846
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,320
hunting

847
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,919
doesn't exist in a vacuum it will thrive

848
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,200
when shared and distributed strive for

849
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,360
perfection

850
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,760
so you always be innovative on

851
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,719
experimenting new techniques

852
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,960
to be better than you were yesterday

853
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,960
right

854
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,360
so according to the art of war

855
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,080
zoo if you know the enemy and

856
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,320
know yourself you need not fear the

857
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,519
result of a hundred battles

858
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,639
if you know yourself but not the enemy

859
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,840
or if you know the enemy but not know

860
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,320
yourself for every victory gain it

861
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,678
