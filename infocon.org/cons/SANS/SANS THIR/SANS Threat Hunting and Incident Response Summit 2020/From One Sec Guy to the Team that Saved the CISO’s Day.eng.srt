1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,200
with that said i

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,280
am very very excited to actually be uh

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,959
introducing our next speaker

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
i'm excited to be introducing her for a

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
couple of reasons number one she's

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,359
someone who i used to call

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,400
a colleague and that is a good thing uh

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,760
she's actually still at this

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,599
organization we used to work together

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
we've worked investigations together and

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
i've had the privilege of being on the

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,800
phone with

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
very very important people asking very

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,520
demanding questions and

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
my being able to say my colleague mary

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,760
here has the answer to that and that was

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,519
a

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
good highlight of my career for a period

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,360
in time um

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
mary's also someone who interestingly

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,280
enough i

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,399
i keep running into at uh interesting

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
locations

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,559
so um i ran into mary at a conference in

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,559
arizona

26
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,000
last year uh we run into a lot of sans

27
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,000
events and that kind of stuff

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
and then there's just times where things

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
pop up and i'll be like

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,120
i think that's mary and i will end up

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
saying hey and seeing what's going on so

32
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
it's

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
one of those awesome um sans folks who

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,080
i have the wonderful privilege of

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,119
calling a friend calling a colleague

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,798
having done work with and i also have to

37
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,240
add in that when it comes to

38
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,520
research mary is by far a

39
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,479
very very formidable force she

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
does not let any topic of interest go

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
unresearched

42
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,280
unfounded and undocumented and some of

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,799
mary's blog post which i highly

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,479
recommend a lot of you check out

45
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,479
and this is kind of setting the stage

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,119
for what i'm expecting from today's talk

47
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,720
uh are just so in-depth and informative

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,720
that you walk away from that being like

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,000
i didn't expect to learn this much but

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,200
oh my gosh i need to go

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,119
and research like this person does so

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,159
with that said we're going to go ahead

53
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,000
and marry i'm going to go ahead and get

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,759
you started feel free to take as much

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
time as you'd like

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
no worries we do have a break schedule

57
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
right after this so if you run a little

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
bit over we've got room

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
if you finish right on time that's fine

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
not a problem at all but without further

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,960
ado ladies and gentlemen when scp yeah

62
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,640

63
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
i i wanted to be careful about how

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
excited i got about this title because i

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,798
really wanted to you know

66
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,359

pronounced um mary degrazia from another

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
forensics blog

69
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,599
mary glad to have you here ah thank you

70
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,480
so much matt and today i am so excited

71
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,599
to be talking about when scp yeah you

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,840
know me

73
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,359
and today we're gonna go ahead and do

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,319
this in the theme of the 90s right

75
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
2020 has been crazy so i just kind of

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
wanted to look back

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,239
on to a fonder time in my life the uh

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,879
90s and ah yes the 90s who

79
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,519
who doesn't love the 90s so one of these

80
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,399
pictures

81
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,959
is me i'm looking at my my hallway now

82
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,879
so

83
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,560
if you have an idea or you think you

84
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,079
might know which one of these uh

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
permed 90s is me um

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
take a guess and i will let you know a

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
little bit of background information

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
about myself i'm an associate managing

89
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,518
director

90
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,080
at troll cyber security and there i work

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
a lot

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
of you know digital forensics and

93
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,079
incident response cases

94
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
i've been in the it industry now for

95
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
about

96
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,959
20 years and then specializing in defer

97
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,920
for about the last

98
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,400
10. i'm also a science instructor where

99
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
i

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
get to teach windows forensic analysis

101
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,319
so i see

102
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,920
we have ones ones okay guess what i'm

103
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,879
actually number two

104
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,679
uh that was my prom picture just totally

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,480
rocking

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,159
the 90s hair uh number one i have no

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
idea who that is random person on the

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
internet when you google you know 90s

109
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519
permed hair and number three this is

110
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,319
actually someone

111
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
from one of my favorite movies legally

112
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
blonde

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,120
okay so moving on in to

114
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,319
win scp so when we think about networks

115
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,360
getting compromised and attackers moving

116
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,560
throughout the

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,599
environment what we see a lot of times

118
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,720
is the usage of rdp

119
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,119
so with rdp you know

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
we get a lot of really cool artifacts we

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
get event log

122
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
entries the terminal services local

123
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,400
session

124
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,359
manager event log ids like 21 letting us

125
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,120
know there was

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,919
a log in we get the 4624 entries

127
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
type 10. when we think about lateral

128
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,440
movement in the environment and we want

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,320
to know what an attacker has

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,600
done what you know folders have they

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
accessed where have they

132
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,400
traversed throughout the environment we

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
have artifacts like shelby's

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,159
shell banks can show us you know what

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,759
they may have access while they were on

136
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,320
that system we can get things like

137
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,960
link files and jump lists all these

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
things

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,359
go towards helping us determine lateral

140
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,960
movements so any guesses on what a

141
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
movie this is from i think it's a little

142
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
bit before the 90s but i just felt like

143
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
you know we had to give a shout out to

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,719
this

145
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,919
one of the reasons i really like this

146
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,400
scene

147
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,919
in war games is they actually kind of

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,840
get in through this obscure

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,758
back door and it's not actually right to

150
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
the main uh system it's like this old

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,160
system they kind of forgot about and i'm

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,479
like wow

153
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
uh watching this many many years later

154
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,680
i'm like that actually rings

155
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,840
really true to home the same techniques

156
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,440
they were using you know back in the 80s

157
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
uh is still something that we see to

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,479
date which i thought was kind of cool

159
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,758
so but we're not talking about rdp today

160
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,039
we are talking about

161
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,000
when scp so with win scp

162
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,680
i'm going to focus on the portable

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,400
version of winscp

164
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
now if you go to the download page for

165
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,039
winscp

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360
the first program you're going to

167
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,840
encounter is you know the windows

168
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,440
installer with the windows installer we

169
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
get some registry entries where it

170
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
stores information

171
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,638
but what we're seeing at pool and what

172
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
i'm seeing in my investigations

173
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
is when scp portable so with the

174
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,198
portable version you know they just

175
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,280
download a zip file and everything

176
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,560
is unzipped and it's contained right

177
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,280
there so it's not

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
making entries in uh you know the

179
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,359
typical program files directory

180
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,198
it's not storing its entries in the

181
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
registry it's in a different location

182
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,160
which we'll talk about

183
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,720
in a little bit so what is when scp

184
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,600
how is it different than rdp so when a

185
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,639
cp

186
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,319
uses ssh to make the connections okay

187
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,919
and when it does this it gives a little

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
bit of a different interface

189
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,120
when we think about rdp you know you're

190
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
logging in

191
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
to essentially the user's desktop your

192
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,160
presenter

193
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
their desktop whatever it looks like and

194
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
interacting with it and just like you're

195
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,840
almost sitting down in front of the

196
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
computer

197
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,960
well when a cp gives the attacker an

198
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ability

199
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,599
to browse folders on a remote system now

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
this remote system

201
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,160
can be one that's inside the network or

202
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,440
it could be one that is

203
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
external so we have two different uh

204
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
tracks that we're going here when we

205
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
think about an

206
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
attacker connecting externally this is

207
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,758
going to

208
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
be where we start thinking about data

209
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,560
exfiltration

210
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,520
when we think about internally we start

211
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,400
to think about

212
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,400
lateral movement within the environment

213
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,159
very similar to rdp

214
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,560
some things that they can do with when

215
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,759
scp might surprise you too

216
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
right here we have a find files so they

217
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,240
can

218
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,840
actually use winscp to run searches now

219
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,199
traditionally if we think about an

220
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,159
attacker using

221
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
rdp to run searches they'll be using the

222
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
windows

223
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,719
interface to do this so we get entries

224
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
like the word

225
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
wheel query where we can see what

226
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,840
searches they've run

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
but if they start running their searches

228
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,000
through when scp

229
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,198
we lose that visibility because they're

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,240
outside

231
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,639
of that windows framework if you will

232
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,319
they also have the ability to download

233
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,319
files so right here you know

234
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
if they find a folder they like they can

235
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,800
download that onto

236
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,400
the host system or they can go the other

237
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,000
way so exfiltration

238
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,239
you know they can take data from that

239
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,680
system and pass it on

240
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,759
out to an external system

241
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
um so now we start thinking they're

242
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,240
using winscp

243
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,960
they're not interacting with the windows

244
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
explorer

245
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,638
shell which means we lose shell banks

246
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,319
we also lose that 4624 event id

247
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,000
10 because they're not connecting in

248
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
through rdp and

249
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,759
um you know the local session uh

250
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,160
managers well

251
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,440
we're losing those terminal services

252
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,759
entries so

253
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
um so now we think about this mechanism

254
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,720
where the attackers

255
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,319
can move laterally throughout the

256
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,240
environment using one scp

257
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,200
so you might be thinking hey well with

258
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:40,799
rdp the reason why they're using rdp

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,159
is because it's built in natively to

260
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,560
the windows operating system but

261
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,920
you know with win scp now they have to

262
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,199
set up a client to

263
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,640
receive those connections and guess what

264
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,399
um starting with windows uh we now

265
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,279
uh have basically an ssh

266
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,480
client that can be installed on the

267
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,240
system

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,640
with one simple powershell command line

269
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
so when we work our cases and especially

270
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,040
when we talk about ransomware cases

271
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
we see something that attackers are

272
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
using called

273
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,240
and i like to call them prepper scripts

274
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,640
um they can be power shell scripts they

275
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
can be

276
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,399
batch files but basically they kind of

277
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,760
get the environment

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,839
ready to push out ransomware and one of

279
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,360
the things that these prepper scripts do

280
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
um so the update was windows 10 1809

281
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,160
which i believe

282
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,839
was the fall the fall edition

283
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,319
um when this was pushed out

284
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
so with this version uh basically you

285
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,160
can run this powershell command

286
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,560
and boom you get an open ssh server and

287
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,399
what uh this can be done now said in

288
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,439
these prepper scripts instead of

289
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,200
um pushing out or opening up rdp and

290
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
enabling the firewall rule

291
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
and now you can just use the powershell

292
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
command and you can

293
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,360
instantly install this ssh server there

294
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
are two things in the background that

295
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
windows does

296
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,000
when you install it this way one it

297
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
automatically does the firewall rule two

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
it

299
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,160
automatically adds in an open ssh user

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
uh so this makes it relatively easy to

301
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,839
set up

302
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,160
an ssh client within the environment

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,880
very similar to how we've seen rdp

304
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,800
in the past once that's been done they

305
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,839
just start up the service and

306
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,160
bonus points that they want to throw to

307
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,880
set

308
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
service and let's start up automatically

309
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,839
so you know

310
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
it can certify the reboot so you know

311
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
one line to get that client installed

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,959
and a couple more to start it up

313
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,040
and then additional one for persistent

314
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
mechanism so you know if an attacker is

315
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,599
compromised the network this is pretty

316
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
trivial

317
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,040
for them to kind of prep the environment

318
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,279
and get it ready

319
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,399
to begin using uh something like when

320
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
scp

321
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
to start traversing throughout and doing

322
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,959
that lateral movement

323
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,959
within the environment okay so

324
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,839
who remembers this guy right uh who is

325
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,000
this

326
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
map something i think so here we have

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,360
max he's our attacker

328
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,560
and now that he's got win scp he can

329
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,640
move laterally throughout the

330
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,599
environment using one scp

331
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,800
and possibly fly underneath the radar

332
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,200
for threat hunters that

333
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,839
might be looking for lateral movement

334
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
via

335
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,560
rdp uh so now our attacker can move

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,800
laterally

337
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,680
uh they've got this set up uh but what

338
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
can we find

339
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,279
associated with when scp what kind of

340
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,079
artifacts

341
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
uh as threat hunters um are we gonna

342
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
have a visibility into

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,120
and i'll be going into each one of these

344
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,000
during this presentation

345
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,680
okay one we can get a byte count of data

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
transferred which is really cool

347
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,120
with the newer operating systems there's

348
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,000
this artifact called the shrum

349
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,240
and the shrum records network activities

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,800
so now we can actually get a byte count

351
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,800
in between these two systems uh data

352
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
that's transferred back and forth which

353
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,120
can give us some visibility into

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
possibly

355
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
how much data has been uh transferred

356
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,240
and we're going to get systems connected

357
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
to

358
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,440
uh remote directories access uh change

359
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,680
directory history which is really cool

360
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,600
we can actually see a folders that have

361
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,239
been traversed through so when we start

362
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
thinking

363
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,560
that we've lost this visibility with

364
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,839
shell banks we can get some of this

365
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,079
by some logging that occurs with win scp

366
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
we can see the user account that was

367
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,560
used for the connection so now

368
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
when we think about our threat heading

369
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,479
we will know okay this account has been

370
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
compromised we need to go take a look at

371
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
the

372
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,040
activity associated with this account

373
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
and see where else within the

374
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
environment it has

375
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,200
logged into so that we can know where we

376
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,279
need to expand our scope

377
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,440
we can see the last folder open we'll

378
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
talk about some event log entries that

379
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,880
can be used to hunt for

380
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,439
and we also get things like the last

381
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,680
execution date first execution date

382
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,800
this will give us an idea of the time

383
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,439
frame that when

384
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,040
scp was being utilized you know were

385
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
they using this for a day were they

386
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,839
using this for a week

387
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
or have we they've been in the

388
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,560
environment you know for six

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,959
months doing whatever they want and then

390
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,719
we

391
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,439
might be able to get some visibility on

392
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
the files copy there is no log per se of

393
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,279
files copied

394
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,719
but there are some artifacts that are

395
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
that you can kind of use to make this

396
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,440
determination although that one

397
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
not my favorite artifact to rely on all

398
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,519
right so

399
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,920
the usual suspects you know one about

400
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,680
program execution uh you know you're

401
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,839
gonna have your normal things

402
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
have your prefetch file indicating and

403
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
ran your users

404
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
uh your created and your modified data

405
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,599
and i'm gonna spend a lot of time

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,920
talking

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,120
about those um but i'm really going to

408
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,639
focus on

409
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,760
is the star of the show the win scp

410
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,800
dot ini file okay

411
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,880
so with the winning cp.ini file uh one

412
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,839
of the coolest artifacts that we're

413
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,800
going to

414
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,519
find is called the cd cache now the

415
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,719
winscp.ini file

416
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,839
is just a plain text and each

417
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,320
and it has a header that has a bracket

418
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,360
on each side so the first one we're

419
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,880
going to take a look at

420
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,920
is the configuration cd cache

421
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,199
this will contain the user name that is

422
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,240
used to connect

423
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
into the system as well as the ip

424
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,880
address

425
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,439
so by looking at this when scp.ini

426
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
file we can immediately get visibility

427
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,839
into what accounts have been compromised

428
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,600
and what other systems we need to take

429
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,040
a look at to see um you know where we

430
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
need to expand the scope what other

431
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,120
systems have they connected to

432
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,320
did they connect into that finance

433
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,880
system that has

434
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,440
you know all of the w-2s on it and the

435
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,839
hr

436
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
information we see that so many times in

437
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
ransomware cases

438
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,800
they pull this information back and you

439
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,320
know they want to use that

440
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,439
if you're able to restore from your

441
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,959
backups well now they're going to

442
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,199
blackmail you because they have

443
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,800
all this personal information so we

444
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,479
really want to get an idea of what

445
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,479
systems they have connected to

446
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
and this includes you know possibly an

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
external system so we might be able to

448
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,760
make a determination

449
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,760
or be aware of the fact that there was

450
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,160
exfiltration that happened

451
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,600
um so an example of what this looks like

452
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,279
is uh right here so here we have um the

453
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,560
account it support

454
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,360
and it was used to connect into this ip

455
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
address

456
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,800
um this hex right here is what

457
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,399
makes up the cd cache so you can use

458
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,479
something like cyber chef

459
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
or whatever is your favorite programming

460
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,160
tool to

461
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
convert that and once you convert it you

462
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,920
get basically a little

463
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
mru of directories that have been

464
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,399
traversed

465
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,560
into uh using the cd or you know

466
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,920
the change directory command so right

467
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,959
here you can see

468
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,639
uh the attacker was on one system and

469
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,719
they were browsing folders on

470
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,399
another system and looking for some

471
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,199
secret information

472
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,320
uh this can also if they are accessing

473
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
their system

474
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,560
outside of the network so we can see

475
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,839
some really interesting things

476
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
we might get ability into staging

477
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
folders

478
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,839
and they've exfiltrated out data onto

479
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,040
their remote systems

480
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,519
in fact i was working a case once where

481
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,240
we actually saw you know another

482
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,000
company's

483
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,279
name here than the client that we

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
currently have

485
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,439
so this kind of gave indication that you

486
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,000
know this attacker was using the

487
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,519
external

488
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
system not to exfiltrate our clients

489
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,320
data

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
but another company well because we did

491
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
not break

492
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,839
the name at all okay so

493
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,240
moving on from the cd cache we have the

494
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,120
configuration interface commander

495
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
local panel this will contain the last

496
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
path

497
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,000
browse to on the host machine but it

498
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
does not indicate that anything was

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,680
saved there

500
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
so this is basically the next time a

501
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
user starts to win a cp

502
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,720
it's going to remember that was the

503
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,119
directory that they were working

504
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,679
so that you know they keep on browsing

505
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,719
through folders um when i use winning

506
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,000
p to um you know connect into my

507
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,600
raspberry pi

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
i tend to keep like all my python

509
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,719
scripts in one directory

510
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,400
and then i use them to transfer back and

511
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,760
forth it's really nice because i don't

512
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,280
have to sit there and click through and

513
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,160
browse through all my directories

514
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,918
so this is basically what uh oh my

515
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
goodness someone just posted a picture

516
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,600
of a

517
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,080
cd a cd case right okay

518
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,600
this is great i think i moved last year

519
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
or no two years ago

520
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
and i actually went through and i had to

521
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,678
clean out um all my cds i was like

522
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,959
really am i really gonna use that old

523
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,799
copy of windows 98 for something um

524
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
funny story i actually did when i first

525
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,639
started my career

526
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,160
um i had to load up a windows 98 and i

527
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,720
put the cd in

528
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,400
and it spun up and it shattered into

529
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,360
like a million pieces i don't know what

530
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,720
happened if the

531
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,479
cd was uh old or if it was unbalanced

532
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,840
but all of a sudden i heard this like

533
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,520
bam what was that and my cd was in a

534
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
million pieces it was so old

535
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,000
so i figured i should throw them all out

536
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,918
okay so this is our local panel

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
that can give us some visibility onto

538
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
the host machine

539
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,678
what they may have been doing on it so

540
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,600
in this particular example with the

541
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,679
local panel

542
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,639
we have a directory here called recon

543
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,400
tools so

544
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,000
in this particular instance what the

545
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,760
attacker has done is actually

546
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,080
they're working on the host machine with

547
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,879
the win scp they've got some staging

548
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,399
tools there

549
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
and as they're doing their lateral

550
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,320
movement with nscp

551
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
in the environment they're pulling their

552
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,678
tools from their host machine

553
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,840
and they're putting them on the remote

554
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,880
machine that they're connecting into

555
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,399
so in this ini file you know after they

556
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
leave and after they're done they may

557
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,840
delete this

558
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,919
recon tools folder so we may not have

559
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,879
known it was there but by looking at the

560
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,600
dot ini

561
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
file uh you know we might find evidence

562
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,240
of that which is really cool

563
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,760
um and then the other way we think you

564
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,799
know lateral movement moving around

565
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
within the environment

566
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,879
it can also be related to exfiltration

567
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,640
they might have names of systems there

568
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
that they were pulling data back

569
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
uh to organize all of their data with

570
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,320
okay

571
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
so another really cool one

572
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
the local target configuration history

573
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,440
local target

574
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,720
now this one it is only created if a

575
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,919
file or folder

576
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,440
is saved on the host so when we start

577
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
thinking about this this is

578
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,960
where we think about staging for

579
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
exfiltration

580
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,120
so up to this point in time we have

581
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,240
evidence that they've browsed at certain

582
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,879
locations

583
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,679
on systems but if they actually take a

584
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
file

585
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
and they save it back now we're going to

586
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
get this local target so this

587
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,120
is kind of our evidence that okay

588
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
there's something more going on than

589
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,719
just browsing

590
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
they're pulling back data from systems

591
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
they could be staging it for

592
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,760
exfiltration or vice versa

593
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
this might be evidence that they're

594
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,640
bringing in tools from an external

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,799
server and saving them on the system

596
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
okay moving on this is an example of

597
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,879
what this looks like

598
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,960
um now what's kind of interesting um you

599
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,960
know did some testing on this

600
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,120
and the results were kind of mixed it

601
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
may only capture the first session

602
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,239
information

603
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
so it might only capture the first time

604
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,520
that they've been saving files this is

605
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,959
one of those artifacts where

606
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,960
um i just couldn't really find some

607
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
consistency with it i need to go back i

608
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,039
need to do some more testing and figure

609
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
out

610
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,640
why things happened a certain way but

611
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,480
you know at least

612
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
it's something right that we can work

613
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,320
with here so this is going to be

614
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,200
underneath your configuration history

615
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,439
local target and just some examples you

616
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,360
know of some folders and files that were

617
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,159
saved here

618
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,918
okay so remote target configuration

619
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,320
history remote target

620
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,760
files were uploaded to this directory

621
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,158
from the host machine

622
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,039
to the remote system so going the other

623
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,799
way now

624
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
once again may only capture the first

625
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,120
session copy information

626
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,158
uh here we get an mru list so zero is

627
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,639
going to be

628
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,440
the most recent so what's kind of fun

629
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,039
about this

630
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,679
is you know you kind of start getting

631
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,240
visibility into what the attacker

632
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,440
remote might look like right if i see

633
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
something like a root

634
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,520
here um this is a good chance that this

635
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,360
is a linux system that they might be

636
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
using and then once again i might get

637
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,559
visibility

638
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,320
uh by looking at these remote targets

639
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,520
what systems they've compromised in the

640
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,360
environment you know they might have

641
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,158
domain controller one there domain

642
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
controller two

643
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,840
file share one file share two so in the

644
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,520
remote target i can check this variable

645
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,039
and that will give me some ideas of you

646
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,600
know what they've uh

647
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,840
compromised so once again when we start

648
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,439
talking about evidence of exfiltration

649
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,000
which is always one of those things

650
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,200
that can be really hard to prove

651
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
definitively

652
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,559
this helps to give us pieces of that

653
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,960
puzzle

654
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,200
to put together and say you know i'm

655
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,440
seeing when it's cp being used you know

656
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,720
i'm seeing a remote target access i can

657
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,760
see the attacker

658
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,840
you know accessing a remote machine i

659
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,799
can see that they access these ten

660
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,199
machines

661
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,360
uh in the network and these are all the

662
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,280
folders that they visited

663
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,399
uh kind of starts to paint a grim

664
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
picture right but

665
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,440
you know it can help answer some of

666
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,720
these questions that we may have lost

667
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
visibility into

668
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
earlier okay so the configuration

669
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,679
history mask

670
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,720
now i talked earlier about the ability

671
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
of the attacker

672
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,440
to search for files uh without within

673
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
the systems

674
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,039
so they can use you know this file mask

675
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,159
to do it maybe they're looking for some

676
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,600
interesting

677
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,520
um you know files named ssn or w2

678
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,719
and believe it or not people call

679
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,600
password files

680
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
password so uh that's a really common

681
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,799
one right there is to see searches ran

682
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,000
for password

683
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,840
so there this is stored in the ini file

684
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,360
so this is kind of equivalent to

685
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,320
our word will query right we can see

686
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,520
the keywords that were used to run

687
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,918
searches which once

688
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,520
again is really cool we kind of get this

689
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,520
peek into

690
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,039
you know what was their intent when they

691
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,720
were in the environment were they just

692
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,679
looking for passwords

693
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,240
or are they looking for financial data

694
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,120
are they looking for very specific

695
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,720
uh you know intellectual property you

696
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,840
know what what kind of information are

697
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
we going to find here

698
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
that they could be searching for um

699
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,000
another interesting thing is and it's

700
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,120
not something i really dive into here

701
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,360
but using scp you can actually double

702
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,600
click on and edit a file

703
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,199
so a lot of times i use it just if i

704
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,399
want to do something quick instead of

705
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,600
logging in through like putty and

706
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
running nano

707
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,360
and editing a file i can do it right

708
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,200
through when sap for a simple

709
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
text file now it doesn't have a complex

710
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,440
viewer you know like for word documents

711
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,640
and pdf files but it's great just to

712
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,240
quickly view

713
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,840
um text files so that's just something

714
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,799
else to be aware of you know after they

715
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,279
run a fine

716
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,918
they could double click on a text file

717
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,039
open it up

718
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,600
and take a view of it right so excellent

719
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,600
this gives us uh some visibility like i

720
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,760
said into intent motivation

721
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,799
what it is that they can be doing on the

722
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
network

723
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,879
okay so uh in addition to

724
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
um these file masks that are used we

725
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,320
also

726
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,279
have a section that will let us know the

727
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,918
location

728
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,360
of where these searches were ran so the

729
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,480
configuration history

730
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,879
remote directory so now we have the

731
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,919
keywords we also know some locations

732
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,880
where they may have been

733
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,440
ran we can go check those locations to

734
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
see

735
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,080
what it is the attacker may have found

736
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,320
when they were running those searches

737
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
so when we start thinking legally from

738
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,720
the perspective of

739
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,199
notification um is this going to require

740
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
us to notify anybody are we going to

741
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,919
have to let this employee know that they

742
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,760
need to go and change

743
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
all of their passwords for their you

744
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,480
know personal accounts

745
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
things of that nature this is going to

746
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,200
give us some visibility

747
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,960
into folders that the attacker

748
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,480
ran the searches on which is really cool

749
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,080
here's an example of what this looks

750
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
like so obviously you know they were

751
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,559
running searches here

752
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,960
in the hr documents and then at the root

753
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,320
of the documents folder so i don't know

754
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,000
if you've been noticing that throughout

755
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,918
this presentation i have been giving

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,960
another 90s flashback

757
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,720
uh to some usernames crash override

758
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,000
and acid burn uh does anybody recognize

759
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,559
what movie those names are from

760
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,039
hackers right daniel very good hackers

761
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
movie

762
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,559
it was another movie i went back and

763
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,760
watched recently and really

764
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,799
enjoyed it okay when is cp

765
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,080
timestamp so the timestamps of these

766
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,559
files are pretty interesting the winning

767
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,760
cp.ini

768
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,399
file actually does not exist in that

769
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,520
portable

770
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,880
until the first time that you run win

771
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,000
scp so when you run

772
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,520
win scp it creates this when sap

773
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
ini file so that's going to give you

774
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,720
your visibility into the first time

775
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,720
that when scp runs a lot of times when

776
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,240
files are unzipped we get uh

777
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
you know kind of this wonkiness that

778
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,840
happens with time stamps

779
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,678
uh you know they will carry over create

780
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,120
a date modified date sometimes and we

781
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
don't actually know but

782
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,719
because the when scp-2ini file is not

783
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,199
created until the first time it runs

784
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,799
we get some nice visibility into that

785
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,159
the winsc peta ini

786
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,480
is also last modified or updated

787
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
each time when a cp closes because it's

788
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,000
saving out

789
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,120
all those preferences for the user so

790
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,360
you know this is great

791
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,439
because if we talk about and we're asked

792
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,240
okay how long was one of cp running on

793
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,200
the system

794
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,320
how many times did they use it you know

795
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,240
what kind of data

796
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,520
did they access what kind of systems

797
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,600
they access

798
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,200
just by this one scp folder we can

799
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,678
answer a lot of those questions

800
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,120
um so if we take the created date and

801
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,200
that modified date

802
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,639
we can then pair that with the prefetch

803
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,520
file and on

804
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
um newer windows systems with a prefetch

805
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
file

806
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,279
you're going to get additional time

807
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,879
stamps up to eight of them in that

808
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,679
prefetch so now if we look at that

809
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,679
prefetch

810
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,840
we could possibly get you know different

811
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,559
timestamps that we can go look at on the

812
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,480
system

813
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,678
uh that we know the attacker was there

814
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,799
and was using

815
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,720
win scp okay um so

816
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,080
that is all the default stuff that win

817
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,640
scp saves

818
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,039
uh thankfully for us without even asking

819
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,559
the user right this one is

820
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,240
being created in the background my user

821
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,960
kind of has no idea that this is going

822
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,080
on

823
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,360
uh they do or they are presented uh

824
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,678
when they exit win scp with the option

825
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
to

826
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,559
save a workspace so if the attacker is

827
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,240
like sure yeah save my workspace you're

828
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
going to have an additional entry in

829
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,600
there

830
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,520
called sessions with the workspace name

831
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,120
now this is the default one you know

832
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,120
very highly doubt the attacker is going

833
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,879
to be like just see my workplaces the

834
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,158
hacking workspace

835
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
but if they do you're going to get lucky

836
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
you're going to have some information in

837
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,640
there as well

838
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,720
host name username local directory

839
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,480
remote directory all saved underneath

840
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
that particular workspace

841
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,640
but the really cool thing is you could

842
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,600
get a password too

843
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,159
so if they save uh their workspace to

844
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,360
their external system and a password

845
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,679
you might actually uh get the password

846
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
um i have a link here at the bottom it's

847
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,080
cut off on my screen i hope you can see

848
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,000
it but it actually

849
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
walks through the the process of how you

850
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,520
can decode this password

851
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,440
so now you could potentially have an ip

852
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,720
address of an external system

853
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,640
or you know if you're wondering what

854
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,559
password was compromised

855
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,240
in your environment and what user

856
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,918
account this can give you that

857
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,000
visibility there which is kind of a

858
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
really fun thing

859
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,760
okay so here we're talking about the

860
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,479
shrum database so uh this is where we

861
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,760
can see

862
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,960
the bytes received and the bytes sent

863
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,520
while the application was being used um

864
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,320
so for bytes received where when scp is

865
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,879
being written

866
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,799
in the shrimp database you can pull out

867
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,760
you can see right here it was the wcp

868
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,760
application

869
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,039
and how many bytes received and bytes

870
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,600
spent

871
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,399
occurred during these time frames so

872
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,559
just uh for this example i had sorted by

873
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,840
bytes received this was the largest that

874
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,360
came up to the top

875
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,039
so this is a great place to get

876
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,120
visibility into you know

877
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,919
how much data was it was it games of

878
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,719
data was it just you know maze of data

879
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,559
what was it um and then on the flip side

880
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,919
we have sent so on the system that was

881
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,600
connected into and you can see the

882
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,840
application here doesn't say

883
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,399
when scp but it's the ssh um

884
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,120
demian right here that did that related

885
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,239
to

886
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,799
the system profile okay

887
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,200
so now that we kind of have this

888
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,720
overview of what is it that we can learn

889
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,080
with the winscp

890
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,919
it is time to hunt does anybody

891
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,678
recognize what this shot is from

892
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:05,039
right here um another 90s era movie

893
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,799
a great movie um predator

894
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,799
yes i love predator one of those great

895
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,639
movies so now that we have an idea of

896
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,639
what when is cp the artifacts that

897
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,360
leaves behind we're going to talk about

898
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,279
how you can look for this within your

899
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,879
environment how you can hunt for it

900
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,559
how you can be on the lookout for it so

901
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,559
whether you want to just make sure

902
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,918
nothing untoward is going on or if

903
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,960
you've already suffered

904
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,799
a breach and you want to you know find

905
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,679
out and figure out what happens so right

906
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,240
here

907
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,799
um i have an example of this is always

908
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,120
hard for me to pronounce

909
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,360
velociraptor so this is a great

910
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,719
edm solution free that you could push

911
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
out in your environment and this is just

912
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,200
an example of how you could leverage

913
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,918
this this particular one to hunt for

914
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,039
this win

915
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,679
scp ini file now

916
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,000
with scp to ionize you know this should

917
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,960
be very low fidelity within typical

918
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,279
networks

919
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
not a lot you know if you have a windows

920
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
environment you're really not going to

921
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,720
be seeing

922
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,519
a lot of when scp usage this is

923
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,360
just not something that typical end

924
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
users are using and probably not

925
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,959
something admins are using

926
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,720
unless they're connecting into a linux

927
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,919
system uh so if we

928
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,960
search for this when a cp.ini file

929
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,320
very very um you know

930
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
the results are going to be very

931
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,240
targeted because not only is it tied to

932
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,439
win scp but it's also tied to the

933
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,960
portable version

934
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,120
which i mentioned you have to go through

935
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,120
these extra steps download

936
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
most people that use win scp are going

937
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
to be installing it into the programs

938
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,879
directory

939
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,480
using the inspector right here i'm just

940
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,039
using the file finder

941
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
right there that's built into

942
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:45,840
velociraptor and i've just said go ahead

943
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,080
and look for windows cp to ini

944
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,918
on the c drive and and that's going to

945
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,879
give me that visibility into locating

946
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,120
those systems

947
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,240
where witness cp has been ran as long as

948
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,239
that hasn't been deleted

949
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,320
so let's talk about the event logs that

950
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,799
you can set triggers for

951
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,559
we do get a 4624 but interestingly

952
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,639
enough it's tied to

953
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,799
a login type file we also get an account

954
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,679
name of sshd

955
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,039
this number right here this 1860 appears

956
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,799
to be random based

957
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,879
on my testing so you know you might need

958
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,559
a little bit of a regular expression to

959
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
find this here

960
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,678
domain virtual users and then of course

961
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
this process

962
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,440
sshd.exe

963
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,360
okay the corresponding four six three

964
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,720
four as well with that

965
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,000
um there is an open ssh log okay so this

966
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,039
is probably where you're gonna go for

967
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,760
your big win

968
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,919
um it's gonna have an event id for and

969
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,679
it's gonna say it accepted the password

970
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,720
for the account name

971
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,559
from an ip address on the port ssh

972
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,559
now if you have cis mod configured in

973
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,158
the environment which i highly recommend

974
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,080
you do

975
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,240
it's going to tell you that you know you

976
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,240
have a network connection was detected

977
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,360
and once again give you that source and

978
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,679
destination ip for ssh

979
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,600
if they use powershell to install it

980
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,279
like i said at the beginning

981
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,000
just that example where they can use one

982
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,320
command you're going to get a 4104

983
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,760
entry that you can hunt for which is the

984
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,279
installation of that and then the

985
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,080
corresponding

986
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,039
7040 which is tied to the installation

987
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,039
of that service

988
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,158
and a registry key i'll be talking about

989
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,158
that in uh

990
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,679
pretty quickly here so here's just an

991
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,840
example of sysmon um

992
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,679
the information that it can give you uh

993
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,519
once again this is logging that is not

994
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,320
by default and something that has to be

995
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,919
pushed out

996
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,600
within the environment but you get some

997
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,559
great information with

998
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,678
the sysmon entry so with the witness cp

999
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,519
installer

1000
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,960
you get a bunch of registry keys that

1001
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,720
are installed so instead of using the

1002
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,519
portable now we're talking about the

1003
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,279
installer

1004
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,559
and basically you're going to find the

1005
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,430
same information

1006
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,799
but underneath this key martin

1007
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,640
[Music]

1008
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,559
okay martin so look for martin right

1009
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,880
here i'm not going to try and pronounce

1010
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,559
that correctly that last one

1011
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
so you're going to give this one a cp

1012
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,279
key you can see right here we got the cd

1013
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,919
hash

1014
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,799
uh the history so a lot of the same

1015
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,200
information

1016
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,399
once again you can use an edm solution

1017
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,480
to hunt for this

1018
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,598
we have our mt user and we're just going

1019
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,639
to look for this cd cache key right here

1020
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,159
and the martin key and it's going to

1021
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,079
have that information right there for us

1022
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,200
we can see we've got the root and the ip

1023
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,639
address so these

1024
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,719
are ways you know you can use carbon

1025
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,079
black whatever tool it is you want in a

1026
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,598
similar fashion

1027
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
to hunt for these and what's really nice

1028
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,040
like i said they're low fidelity you're

1029
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,000
not going to get a lot of crazy hits

1030
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,679
that you have to filter

1031
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,719
through on these okay so that concludes

1032
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,839
the presentation uh it is now time for

1033
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,000

1035
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,199
