1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
um well i'm really excited for this next

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
introduction and the next talk

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,280
um introducing ashley pearson uh who is

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,079
going to be talking about

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,960
the the place in the overall information

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,278
security

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
cyber life cycle where threat hunting

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
fits

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,519
really talking specifically from a sock

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
point of view um ashley and i had a

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
chance to

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
chat dm back and forth a little bit here

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,240
uh before the talk

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,000
came to realize well first of all um she

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,360
is a threat hunter with the air force

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,040
down in san antonio

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,280
and came to realize that in each of our

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
non-intersecting air force careers we

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
were both actually assigned

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,160
at different times to the same small

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,039
communication squadron in northern

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,480
california

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,800
which is kind of cool so we've got a

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
little bit of ninth com legacy there

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,360
which is very cool but

26
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
this talk is going to be really relevant

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
for us because a lot of times on the

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
dfir side

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,440
you know we kind of get these these

30
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
blinders on and don't really think about

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
that big picture

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
and think about where uh you know where

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
our

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,560
work product goes and where our sourcing

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,840
or our tip comes from so to speak

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
i know ashley's going to touch a little

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
bit on that and um if you give me one

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,158
more northern california metaphor uh

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,680
from back at beale air force base

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,759
instead of us looking at this down at

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
the the low in the weeds level where we

42
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,640
often are on a daily basis

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,640
she's going to bring it back up to the

44
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,439
70 000 feet or higher

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,520
perspective that the u2 would bring and

46
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,279
uh i'm really looking forward to that so

47
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,798
that said uh welcome ashley we're glad

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
to have you and uh

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
incredibly excited for your talk go

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,520
ahead hey everyone like phil just

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,798
mentioned

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
my name is ashley and i work as a threat

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
hunter at the

54
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
air force commuter computer emergency

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
response team

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,720
i'm really looking forward today to

57
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
talking to you guys about the security

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,439
operations center and where threat

59
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,199
hunting fits into that picture it's

60
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
something i'm really passionate about

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
i've ranted enough about it at work so i

62
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,159
figured why not make it into a talk

63
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,798
right those always make the best things

64
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,799
to talk about

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
just to get into it first and a little

66
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,640
bit about me so you guys know who i am

67
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,560
and where i'm coming from

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,479
like phil mentioned i did work at ninth

69
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
com at beale air force base kind of in

70
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
the middle of nowhere northern

71
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,160
california

72
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,480
as a server admin i started

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,680
my air force career eight years ago and

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
for the first half of it

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,720
i was kind of a jack-of-all-trades

76
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,480
server admin i did a little bit of

77
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
everything i did ticket jockey work at

78
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,760
the help desk i did

79
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,518
server administration a little bit of

80
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
vulnerability management and firewall

81
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,519
management along the way

82
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
and then about halfway through my career

83
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
i decided to switch things up a little

84
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,400
bit and swap over to what is known in

85
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,319
the air force as

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,440
cyber warfare operations which is mostly

87
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,359
cyber security uh kind of in a general

88
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,920
sense to translate it for you guys

89
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
i've worked in a sock for the last three

90
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,200
years

91
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,879
for the last year specifically i've been

92
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
a dedicated threat hunter so i've kind

93
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,840
of done a little bit of everything in

94
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
the security operations center before

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
moving

96
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,440
to dedicated threat hunting full-time

97
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,280
i do have my twitter handle up there if

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,280
you guys want to follow me i do

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
have a very new blog it's only got a

100
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
couple of posts but i'm hoping it's

101
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,879
something to keep up while i

102
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,200
keep delving into the cyber security

103
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
realm i've been super excited because

104
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,238
there's so much to learn in cyber

105
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,760
security so i've been kind of pokemon

106
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,560
collecting certs there down at the

107
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
bottom

108
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,239
going to school taking classes reading a

109
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
bunch of white papers taking as much

110
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,599
training as possible because i'm just

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
really excited to learn about all the

112
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,839
things that defer in general has to

113
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
offer

114
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
so just to go over kind of what i want

115
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,360
to talk about today since i am taking it

116
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,720
back

117
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,879
up to that 10 000 foot view

118
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,239
the overall question is how do you

119
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
integrate threat hunting which is

120
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
relatively new function within a

121
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,319
security operations center with some of

122
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,239
the more traditional

123
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,920
or pre-established processes or roles

124
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,280
right so i'm going to start by just

125
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,879
going over some of those functions and

126
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
roles so we're kind of all on the same

127
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
page since i kind of have to translate

128
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,879
from you know the military jargon to the

129
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
more commercial sector stuff

130
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,840
then i'll kind of go over the culture

131
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,200
shift that needs to happen to really

132
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
make sure that your threat hunting

133
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,238
function is going to be successful and

134
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,480
that your operations the whole is going

135
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
to be successful

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
i'll go into what threat hunting is

137
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,358
maybe what some threat hunters might

138
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,358
look like in your organization so you

139
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,159
can identify them a little bit better

140
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,599
how to mature those operations and then

141
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
ultimately i'm going to go over where

142
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,880
threat hunting

143
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
fits into that picture and how you can

144
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
use that

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,360
to leverage the abilities that threat

146
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,960
hunting can provide to illuminate some

147
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,840
security blind spots that you might have

148
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
in your organization

149
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,840
so i'm sure when we think of a

150
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
traditional sock we all kind of have a

151
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,119
slightly different picture so i put up

152
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
here some of the functions that i think

153
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,840
of and i think of these

154
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,440
as functions that the sock performs

155
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,198
right instead of tying them

156
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,600
specifically to roles because i'm sure a

157
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
lot of us work in organizations where

158
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
just because you're working in a role

159
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
doesn't mean that's the only thing that

160
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
you perform some people are

161
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
hat swappers i think nicole mentioned

162
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,960
that earlier where she

163
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,320
wears one hat for half of her day and

164
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
then she takes it off and wears another

165
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,199
one

166
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
so i like to think of these more as role

167
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,840
agnostic and kind of focus on

168
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,039
exactly what the function's providing to

169
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,400
you and i'm sure a lot of us are going

170
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,759
to have the same ideas here

171
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,080
vulnerability assessments are really

172
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,240
common the network security monitoring

173
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,039
for a sock detection engineering or

174
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,039
forensics

175
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,720
and then we get into the analyst years

176
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
here you know you have your traditional

177
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,000
tier one analyst working the seam alerts

178
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
that come through

179
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
tier two being your traditional incident

180
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,758
response and then tier three if you have

181
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,720
it your smes your advanced incident

182
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,360
response

183
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
that kind of thing and i know i

184
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,919
mentioned earlier

185
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,680
that i moved over to the sock a couple

186
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,799
years ago

187
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,160
and while i was there i kind of wandered

188
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,000
around for my first

189
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
i would say year and a half kind of

190
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
bouncing around trying to figure out

191
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,800
exactly

192
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,120
where my expertise might fit in and lend

193
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
its hand to within the organization

194
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,039
so i've spent a lot more time working

195
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,599
through the analyst tiers than i have

196
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,080
these other secondary positions that

197
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,280
perform those functions and what i

198
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
noticed while i was working that

199
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,960
position is

200
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,800
the way that these functions come

201
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,280
together to work in your sock

202
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
are really going to depend on the people

203
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,359
the processes and the technology

204
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,680
those are going to have such a huge

205
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,120
impact on what roles you have who's

206
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,720
performing those roles

207
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
the tool sets that are available for

208
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
those functions to really shine in your

209
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,919
organization

210
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
but then the other thing that i noticed

211
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,599
is that a lot of these roles if you

212
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,240
think about them at their core

213
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,199
operate on more of a firefighting level

214
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,919
uh you're

215
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
responding to alerts that are generated

216
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
in your organization

217
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
you're performing these functions in

218
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,520
reaction to either

219
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,318
your ids or ips your seam

220
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,000
or even external agency notifications

221
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
which i know are still very common these

222
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
days

223
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,000
but the thing is that's not necessarily

224
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,880
a bad security posture to have

225
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
we just want to try to shift from a more

226
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
reactive posture

227
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
to a more proactive one so if you think

228
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,120
of your typical

229
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
tiered analysts right your incident

230
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
responders

231
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,039
a lot of those guys are going to be

232
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,440
performing their function in response to

233
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
atomic indicators of compromise and it's

234
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,719
going to be very

235
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,800
trigger based like i said you have a

236
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
firewall alert that has fired or a seam

237
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
alert that comes through that your tier

238
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
1 analyst is going to touch

239
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,280
and it's going to be something that's

240
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
already known to them like this is a

241
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,119
known bad

242
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,479
file or ip address or domain and they're

243
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,880
going to respond in performance and

244
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,360
response actions to that

245
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
whereas we want to start looking at how

246
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
to detect

247
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
activity that's tool agnostic we want to

248
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,000
start looking at indicators of attack

249
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
and this is actually something that

250
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,039
crowdstrike has defined that i really

251
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,400
like to use when i

252
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,240
teach new threat hunters that come to

253
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,159
the section or talk to even my own

254
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,720
bosses in the organization

255
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
and these indicators of attack have us

256
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,000
focus on detecting the

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
intent of what an attacker is trying to

258
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,599
accomplish versus just the tool sets

259
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
that they use to accomplish these

260
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,878
actions on object

261
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,479
objectives you're more concerned with

262
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
the steps that they're performing

263
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
within the execution of the cyberkill

264
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,879
chain rather than

265
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,639
again flagging on memicats.exe or

266
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,879
evil.exe right and

267
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
these require no advanced knowledge of

268
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
indicators of compromise

269
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,599
so you're not sitting around at this

270
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,599
point

271
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
waiting for someone to notify you of

272
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,000
something bad happening within your

273
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,159
network

274
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
you are going out and finding things

275
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
that are one

276
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,880
very relevant to your own environment

277
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,399
and that are happening right now so

278
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
instead of taking indicators of

279
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,159
compromise and parsing them down

280
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,159
two things that might be relevant to

281
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,159
your environment you're really going

282
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,040
about it proactively and trying to find

283
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,040
these things yourself

284
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
and of course i feel like you can't talk

285
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
about threat hunting without at some

286
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,200
point bringing up david bianco's pyramid

287
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,359
of pain

288
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
i personally just to get these concepts

289
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
in my head

290
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
i divide the pyramid of pain in half for

291
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,279
me the bottom half of the pyramid of

292
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,120
pain really deals with

293
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,600
and explains those indicators of

294
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,040
compromise in a very easy to digest

295
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
manner

296
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,920
he labels them you know domain addresses

297
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,560
ip addresses hash values those types of

298
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
things

299
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,000
are very easy for you to implement in

300
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,079
your environment when you're looking at

301
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
detection logic to create

302
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,320
but i also want to spin it around a

303
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,440
little bit and think about it

304
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,920
from the adversaries perspective as well

305
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
if you have malicious domain names ip

306
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,360
addresses and hashes they're going to be

307
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
very easy for you to just plug directly

308
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
into

309
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
your ids or ips or any of your other

310
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,920
alerting devices

311
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,120
in your environment right but they're

312
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,839
also very easy for the adversary to

313
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
change

314
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,480
should you alert on them if you flag a

315
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,560
bad domain name it's very very easy for

316
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
them to just swap it over to a new one

317
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,479
register something new

318
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
if you pop an ip address how easy is it

319
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,080
for them to just spin up a new cloud

320
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,800
instance with a different ip address it

321
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,440
is almost laughably easy for them to

322
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,279
change those things too

323
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
but once we get over to that proactive

324
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,079
side and we start focusing on the top

325
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
half of the pyramid of pain there

326
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,199
it's much more difficult for you to

327
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,200
create detection logic around these

328
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
things but it's also

329
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,279
going to be much harder for them to

330
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,319
quickly change to keep evading detection

331
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,640
with your environment

332
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,760
and that's exactly why we want to start

333
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
focusing on the upper half of the

334
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,240
pyramid of pain

335
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,160
if you pop a ttp a tool

336
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,760
or any of the hosts or network artifacts

337
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,120
that they're leaving behind while moving

338
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,600
around in your environment

339
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,440
it's going to take them much longer to

340
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
recover from that detection than it is

341
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,160
if you just focus solely on the bottom

342
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
half of the pyramid of pain here

343
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,439
and i want to make a special note too

344
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,600
that transitioning from reactive to

345
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
proactive can be very slow it's not

346
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,519
going to be

347
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,600
a snap of the fingers alright boys we're

348
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,120
proactive now this is happening

349
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,560
sometimes it can be really difficult and

350
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,200
it's very easy to fall back

351
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,880
into relying on those known indicators

352
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,040
compromise i talked about before so

353
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,200
sometimes it can be a bit difficult

354
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,880
but what you want to ask yourself is so

355
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
how do we start climbing this pyramid

356
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,839
and get away from

357
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
solely focusing on the indicators

358
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,079
compromise and move more towards the top

359
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
half of the pyramid rate

360
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,920
and the answer is threat hunting i

361
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
realize i'm biased in saying this

362
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,240
because i do

363
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,680
really enjoy threat hunting but threat

364
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
hunting really lives

365
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
in the top half of that pyramid of pain

366
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,399
they are

367
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,560
as a function providing internal

368
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,440
notification of malicious behavior

369
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,479
they're not just saying hey i found

370
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,839
memecats.exe that's already going to be

371
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,959
detected by

372
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
the ids or ips or av that you have in

373
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,079
your environment they're going out there

374
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
and finding these things

375
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
based on the behaviors without again

376
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
without that

377
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
notification of the malicious behavior

378
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,720
happening in your environment and that's

379
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,720
very very valuable to you

380
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,120
and i know the typical definition of

381
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
threat hunting that you're going to hear

382
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,279
i'm

383
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,600
a lot of people have touched on it today

384
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,279
as well threat hunting is really

385
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
an iterative approach and it's

386
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,560
hypothesis driven so you're saying

387
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
this malicious behavior is happening in

388
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,599
this manner and this is how i'm going to

389
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
find it and i'm going to prove or

390
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,760
disprove that

391
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,200
and that's kind of a widely accepted

392
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,160
definition but there are still a lot of

393
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,240
misconceptions the biggest one being

394
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,560
that threat hunting is synonymous with

395
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,639
what functions a tier 3 incident

396
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,920
responder can provide to you

397
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,279
that's not necessarily incorrect again

398
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,639
it's going to depend on the people

399
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,920
processes that you have in your

400
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
environment that are going to shape this

401
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
but they really do provide two different

402
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
sides

403
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
of the story to you your tier three

404
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
instant responder is going to be just as

405
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,399
smart

406
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
just as knowledgeable but they're still

407
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,760
focused on that reactive

408
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,599
like waiting for a trigger to happen

409
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,120
before operating whereas whoever's

410
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
fulfilling this threat hunting function

411
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,120
is going to

412
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,120
again go find their own alerts to work

413
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
the sex the successes are just going to

414
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
be dependent on the culture and

415
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,560
personalities that you have fulfilling

416
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
this function in the long run

417
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,279
so you really want to make sure that you

418
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,800
have the right people fulfilling this

419
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,959
function in your organization

420
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
and with that comes some expectation

421
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,239
management

422
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,160
and this isn't just management's

423
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
expectation of the people fulfilling the

424
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,800
threat hunting function this really is

425
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,959
also the threat hunters having realistic

426
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,040
expectations for themselves right

427
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,800
you're not always going to find bad when

428
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,839
you perform a threat hunt and that's

429
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,439
okay

430
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
and this is very different from some of

431
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
those traditional sock functions that we

432
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,599
talked about because

433
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,440
if you work traditional incident

434
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
response you have an alert

435
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,360
you work that from cradle to grave and

436
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,760
then you have expected outcomes and

437
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,360
things that are going to come from that

438
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
whereas sometimes these threat hunts

439
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,160
just aren't going to be producing things

440
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,160
to work from

441
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,839
and that's definitely a hard pill to

442
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
swallow and that's probably the hardest

443
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,880
part of that culture shift that i talked

444
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
about which is why it can

445
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,519
sometimes take a little bit longer to

446
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,518
implement in the long run

447
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
so if everyone could just keep in mind

448
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
while they're performing this

449
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,600
or managing their throat hunters this

450
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,560
quote from captain picard

451
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
it is possible to commit no mistakes and

452
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,479
still lose

453
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
that is not weakness that is life and

454
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
this

455
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,319
you really need to take this to heart

456
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,360
when you're threat hunting you can plan

457
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,519
for weeks or months sometimes

458
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,959
the perfect hunt you can analyze all the

459
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,480
data sources that you're going to need

460
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
or what you're going to look for

461
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
and sometimes you're just not going to

462
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,719
find it and that's okay and it shouldn't

463
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
discourage you

464
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,839
in the long run and managers as well it

465
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
shouldn't

466
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,040
discourage you from supporting your

467
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
threat hunting function

468
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,079
because they're not meeting a 100

469
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,479
success rate in the long run

470
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,079
now if you're meeting if you're never

471
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
finding anything that's when you need to

472
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
go back to the drawing board and make

473
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,680
sure that you take the time

474
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
to learn from some of these mistakes and

475
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,760
that's how we get into

476
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,959
how to perform threat hunting now if you

477
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
look at some of the talks earlier if

478
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,119
you're able to attend them

479
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,639
regardless of organization mitre target

480
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,920
even nicole touched on it when she was

481
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,279
going through her brief earlier

482
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,959
these are going to vary from

483
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,360
organization to organization some people

484
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,319
have a very very detailed methodology in

485
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,440
the way that they perform

486
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,839
threat hunting but the

487
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,560
commonality between all of those things

488
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,199
is

489
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,880
really for general steps and this is the

490
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,240
squirrel model as well which is why i

491
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
like it because it leaves a lot of room

492
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,600
for interpretation

493
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,040
but generally speaking when you're

494
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,240
threat hunting you're going to start

495
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,759
with a hypothesis

496
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,519
again you're going to say hey i think

497
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,040
this activity is happening

498
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
in this manner and here's how i'm going

499
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,839
to find it you're going to perform your

500
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
investigation

501
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
and either prove or disprove that

502
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,319
hypothesis

503
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
and then that's eventually going to lead

504
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,480
to the discovery of new

505
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
tactics or activity within your

506
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
environment

507
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,000
and then it's going to enrich analytics

508
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,040
within your environment

509
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,440
and there's a kind of a hidden step here

510
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
that's

511
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,560
inferred from the informant and rich

512
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,959
analytic step

513
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,719
but it's that feedback part of this loop

514
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,800
that's really important to focus on

515
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,040
and i really want to focus on that one

516
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,199
for just a minute

517
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,240
the hypothesis generation the technique

518
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
discovery

519
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
and the patterns and ttps that you're

520
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,800
going to find

521
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,959
are very important but you're never

522
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,800
going to mature your threat hunting

523
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,279
operations unless you really take the

524
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
time

525
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,399
to learn from some of the mistakes that

526
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,279
you might have made you need to sit down

527
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
and ask yourself

528
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,360
sometimes some really difficult

529
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,040
questions did we find this if yes can we

530
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
create detection logic from it can we

531
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,240
work with the detection engineers here

532
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,120
and maybe detect this in the future so

533
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
we don't have to perform

534
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
manual hunt did we not find anything and

535
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,359
is that a limitation on skill set or

536
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
knowledge base and what can we do to

537
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
remedy that

538
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,839
or is this a tool set or a data set

539
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
limitation

540
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,639
and those are going to be harder to

541
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,719
remediate in the long run but they're

542
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
still very important questions to ask

543
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
because your threat hunts are really not

544
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,720
going to improve

545
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,320
unless you sit down and take recovery

546
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,000
time after to ask yourself these

547
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,480
questions

548
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,839
and as far as the signatures go for

549
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,959
creating detection logic

550
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,720
sometimes you're going to be able to

551
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,079
create detection logic even though

552
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,880
you're performing your threat hunts

553
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,720
based off of

554
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,799
behavioral detection you're still going

555
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,319
to be able to parse out a lot of those

556
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,240
indicators of compromise because those

557
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,280
are still valuable you're still going to

558
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
be able to find

559
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,119
the domains and hashes that you can

560
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,160
blacklist or whitelist or

561
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,639
in your environment but a lot of this is

562
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
going to be

563
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
organization specific and it's still

564
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,799
important to recognize like hey can we

565
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
implement this or is this going to have

566
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,080
to be manually repeated every you know

567
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
couple weeks or a couple months again

568
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,159
that's going to depend on the people

569
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
fulfilling this function but this is a

570
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
really really important step that

571
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,679
doesn't get highlighted enough and it's

572
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,840
really crucial to improving yourselves

573
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
in the long run

574
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,520
and that improvement shouldn't just die

575
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
within the threat hunting section your

576
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
threat hunts really need to start tying

577
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
into

578
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,760
some of the other functions within the

579
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,240
organization right

580
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,520
you can see here in this graphic you

581
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
perform a threat hunt

582
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
and that's going to have incoming

583
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,479
intelligence or

584
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,000
other sources of information you're

585
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,200
going to generate the hypothesis you're

586
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
going to perform the hunt

587
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,320
you're going to perform the

588
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,600
investigation and from that

589
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,760
you're going to get new iocs new ttps

590
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,799
new indicators of attack that can

591
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,320
immediately be

592
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
passed over to your detection

593
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
engineering function

594
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
to create and validate new signatures

595
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
and then those signatures are

596
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,480
immediately going to

597
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,080
feed directly into the alerts and

598
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
incidents that your incident response

599
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
chain is going to be working

600
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
and that's going to lead to more

601
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,960
resolved incidents it's going to improve

602
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,280
your detection time in the long run

603
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
all of those things feed directly into

604
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,559
some of the other positions within the

605
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
security operations center

606
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
and even if you're not finding the exact

607
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
iocs or

608
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,360
indicators of attack that you're working

609
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,960
on you're still going to be able to find

610
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,120
sometimes some

611
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,799
potentially malicious samples of

612
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,520
executables or binaries within your

613
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,280
environment

614
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
now if your threat hunters can perform

615
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
basic analysis that's fine and some

616
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,080
organizations don't have a

617
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,400
dedicated forensics area but if those

618
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,159
malware samples are analyzed or reversed

619
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,799
in any way that's going to generate

620
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
more indicators compromise and that

621
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,320
whole section of this

622
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,679
chart right here is really organization

623
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,280
specific immediately

624
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,880
it's not hey we found this intelligence

625
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,160
and this might pertain to our

626
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,520
environment but we're not sure so we're

627
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,440
going to have to do some research

628
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,280
no this was found in your environment

629
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,799
operating so you know that this is

630
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,879
very relevant to your environment and

631
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,240
you can cut down on some time

632
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,400
between identifying these samples and

633
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
extracting new iocs to then feed right

634
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
back into the incident response chain in

635
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,559
the long run

636
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,719
the nice thing about threat hunting is

637
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,320
it's not disrupting any of the existing

638
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,520
functions within the security operations

639
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
center it kind of fits

640
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,760
directly before some of them because

641
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,280
it's a more proactive approach

642
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
so it complements a lot of the things

643
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,840
that are already there which is

644
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,840
wonderful and makes it far easier to

645
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
implement

646
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,120
each time you run through the threat

647
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
hunting maturity or the feedback

648
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,360
or feed those threat hunt results into

649
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,559
the other areas of your security

650
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,479
operations center

651
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,240
you're going to start shrinking the gaps

652
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
in your detection capabilities

653
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
i mentioned earlier that one of the

654
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,639
biggest benefits that the threat hunting

655
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,639
function provides to you

656
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,280
is identifying gaps that you have

657
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,159
they're looking for

658
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,080
activity and actors and behavior that

659
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,840
have not alerted any of the other

660
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,520
detection capabilities you have in the

661
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,480
mesh that's created your security

662
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,320
enclave

663
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,559
so some of those at the beginning you

664
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,080
might find are very big gaps and very

665
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,200
scary gaps but over time if you start

666
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,720
taking the things that your threat

667
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
hunters are telling you to heart and

668
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
fixing

669
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,960
and taking the time to look at that

670
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,559
feedback loop and take a look at your

671
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,760
environment and say

672
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,760
can we find this if we can

673
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
that's great but how do we fix it how do

674
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,760
we learn from this how do we grow as an

675
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
organization then you're going to

676
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,200
immediately start improving your

677
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,480
security posture and close all of the

678
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,559
security gaps that we mentioned

679
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
the ultimate goals from shrinking all of

680
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,440
these

681
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,039
security gaps in the long run is to

682
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,640
lower the average dwell time of

683
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,080
attackers in your environment

684
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,000
there are a bunch of reports that come

685
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,360
out that the dwell time of actors

686
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,400
within any environment is astronomically

687
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,879
long it's like

688
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,720
a scary number like days and weeks and

689
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,080
months sometimes or years even you'll

690
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,840
see stories come out saying

691
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,360
this activity was occurring for years

692
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,120
and no one knew about it and it could

693
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,320
have very well been prevented had they

694
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,840
implemented a proactive approach to it

695
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,200
so once you start getting after that

696
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,639
type of behavior you're immediately

697
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,919
going to start lowering the dwell time

698
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
of malicious activity in your

699
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
environment

700
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,640
you're also going to start imposing cost

701
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,440
on any of the adversaries if you start

702
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,960
looking at

703
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,559
again the top half of that pyramid of

704
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,080
pain from david bianco

705
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,320
you immediately start tagging and

706
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,199
flagging on some of their harded to

707
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,120
change

708
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,039
indicators of attack which is going to

709
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,080
take them much longer to recover from

710
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,840
than if you

711
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,199
purely rely on the vendor signatures

712
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
that are string matching on some of

713
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
those easier things

714
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,159
from the bottom half of the pyramid of

715
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
pain and you don't want to make this

716
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,200
easy for them

717
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,879
don't make it easy for adversaries to

718
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,320
hide in your network you want to impose

719
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
as much cost as possible

720
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,600
in the long run on them make them change

721
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,480
their tools make them change the way

722
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,480
they behave

723
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,919
make them so worried that they're going

724
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,360
to leave something behind in your

725
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,559
environment that you're going to catch

726
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,158
that they're not going to be able to

727
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,760
hide any longer that's really the

728
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,080
biggest goal from threat hunting

729
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
is they shouldn't feel safe you should

730
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,320
be operating

731
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,000
under the assumed breach mindset where

732
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,280
something bad is happening environment

733
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,120
in my environment and i just haven't

734
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
found it yet and you want them to also

735
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,918
be thinking

736
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,840
they know that i'm here so i have to be

737
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,679
very careful what i'm doing and take

738
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
longer to complete my actions on

739
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,960
objective and you really want to make

740
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,399
sure that they're the ones who are

741
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,760
worried and that you're not worried that

742
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,760
you just haven't found them yet

743
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,559
so in conclusion the right people and

744
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,600
the right processes can easily make this

745
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,960
happen in your

746
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
organization once you get management

747
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,200
buy-off

748
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,039
and start seeing the value that a

749
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,120
proactive mindset can really provide to

750
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,360
your organization in the long run

751
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,559
you'll start immediately closing those

752
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
gaps

753
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,440
and even some of the more difficult

754
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
things if it takes a bit longer that's

755
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,480
okay because you're still improving your

756
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
security posture in the long run

757
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,840
and with that i leave you with a meme

758
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,840
and i ask if anyone has any questions
