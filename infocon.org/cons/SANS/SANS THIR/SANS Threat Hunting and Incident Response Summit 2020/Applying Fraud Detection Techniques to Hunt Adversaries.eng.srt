1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,519
um

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
i'm really excited for this next talk uh

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,280
nicole hoffman

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
uh comes with to us with a great

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,520
experience in

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,080
a lot of fraud identification fraud

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,560
research

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,799
and investigation and uh the reason i'm

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,479
so excited about this is is

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,480
an area that i worked in extensively and

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,840
i had a little bit of a sneak preview on

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
on your slides nicole

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,399
and i'm really really pumped for what

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,079
you'll be uh what you'll be presenting

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
um i don't want to steal your thunder at

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
all but uh i'm i'm

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,879
this is an area where i think a lot of

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
people need to focus on for a couple of

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,519
reasons

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,599
even if you're not doing fraud

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
investigations on a daily basis

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
we see this kind of proliferation of

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
capabilities

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
and you see what we tend to see is

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,480
initially you've got state level

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,680
adversaries the cream of the crop the

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,279
well-funded

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
and their capabilities are eventually

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,680
going to percolate down

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,440
or as i said proliferate into the

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,480
organized crime area where we see a lot

32
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,760
of fraud work

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,600
um and then you start to see that

34
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
proliferate even further into a more

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
commoditized capability so

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
if you're looking at the what i like to

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
call the bargain basement threat actors

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
they're going to be using you know

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
months or maybe a year

40
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,039
what's in the organized crime area right

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,479
now if you're looking instead of the

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,000
state level adversaries what you're

43
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
seeing is going to eventually become

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
this

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
organized crime kind of capability so

46
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
the fraud becomes this

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
middle ground where you see a lot of

48
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,920
this this capability so

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
i'd like to i wanted to frame up your

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,520
your talk in that regard because

51
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,360
even if it's not someone who's working

52
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
with law enforcement or with fraud

53
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
investigations

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
there really is this nexus between where

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
a lot of us are working as well so i'm

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
super excited for your perspective on

57
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
this and i'm glad you can join us so

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
without any further a delay i mean

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,720
nicole please take it away

60
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,040
thank you so much um so i am going to be

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,200
presenting on applying fraud detection

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
techniques to hunt adversaries

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,600
um like phil had stated i am going to be

64
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,079
talking a good amount about

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,000
my life as a fraud analyst as well as

66
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,560
fraud detection but it is first

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360
and foremost a hunting story so if

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
you're interested

69
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
in you know some a hunting story that's

70
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,599
a bit different than your typical cyber

71
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,440
hunting definitely stick around

72
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,599
so a little bit about me i am currently

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,920
a cyber threat intelligence analyst or

74
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,040
i would like to be due to the pandemic i

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
am looking for

76
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
new opportunities i've been actively in

77
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,879
the field for about three years

78
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
i did recently start a blog

79
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,239
threathhuntergirl.com if you're

80
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,120
interested

81
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,800
i was a fraud analyst before moving into

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
information security

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,959
um i'm morally obligated to tell you

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,879
within the first five minutes of meeting

85
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,599
you that i am a crossfitter so

86
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,280
you're welcome and i really love being

87
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,399
outdoors with my kids

88
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,760
and kayaking i'm a massive

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,440
marvel in dc fan as you can tell i can't

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,959
choose between the two universes

91
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
i just love them too much so

92
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,400
we have a lot to go over in a short

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
period of time so

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
i'm just going to get right into the

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
agenda i'm going to give you a little

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
bit of background

97
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,640
of some things that you need to know to

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
understand

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
check fraud which i'm going to be

100
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
discussing then i'm going to go over the

101
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,238
hunting experience that i had

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
as a financial analyst and then i'm

103
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,120
going to try to apply those lessons to

104
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,040
the cyber domain and just as a note

105
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,680
anytime i mention the name carol she's

106
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,359
the adversary in the financial crime

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,280
uh story it was just easier to identify

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
a name instead of saying this person and

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,120
that person so carol is always evil

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,959
just a fictional name that i made up

111
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
so a lot of people don't know the path

112
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,400
that a check takes after it's deposited

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,760
into the bank

114
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,120
and it's something that i wanted to

115
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,798
discuss before i got into my

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
presentation because it's something that

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,040
adversaries take advantage of

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
so i don't know about you but when i was

119
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
a little girl

120
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
every christmas my grandma used to put a

121
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,399
five dollar check

122
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,319
into my stocking never changed the

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
amount always five dollars so

124
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,839
in this scenario my grandma would be the

125
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
payer

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,959
as the writer of the check and i would

127
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,039
be the payee

128
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
as the receiver of the check i would

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,199
deposit the check into my bank

130
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
the bank would then process the check

131
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,040
and send it to the federal reserve

132
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,120
the federal reserve would process it and

133
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,000
then request the funds from my grandma

134
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
the payer's

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,520
account her bank would then

136
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
process that request and send the funds

137
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,039
back through the federal reserve

138
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
once it's processed in the federal

139
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,919
reserve the funds would be sent back to

140
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,680
my bank

141
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,359
in the event that she doesn't have the

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,919
funds in her account they would send

143
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
that

144
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
message back through the federal reserve

145
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,960
so either way it still has to go through

146
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,359
the federal reserve

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
and this process or this time period is

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
known as the float

149
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
and this is something that adversaries

150
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,799
take advantage of and it's basically the

151
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,000
time period of when i deposit a check

152
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,840
and when that check either bounces or i

153
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
get the funds from my grandma's account

154
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
back into my account

155
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,359
so that's something i want you guys to

156
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,799
be aware of

157
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,680
so picture this you're a fraud analyst

158
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
your department is super overwhelmed you

159
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
have very little resources

160
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,720
you're over understaffed um and

161
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,680
inundated with alerts does that sound

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,639
familiar

163
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,680
it's very similar to the life as a cyber

164
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,240
security analyst or even an engineer

165
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,160
so because my department was

166
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
understaffed i wore a lot of hats

167
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,120
so half my day was spent manually

168
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
reviewing every check that was deposited

169
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
into the organization

170
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,159
the reason that they had the fraud

171
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,080
department doing this is

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,440
is because it allowed us to be in the

173
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
weeds and and

174
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,719
seeing the fraud as it happened and

175
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,520
putting a stop to it

176
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
but it was very very exhausting because

177
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
you

178
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,599
you know you only have a few seconds on

179
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,280
each check because on a typical day you

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,840
have thousands of checks

181
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,679
and you have to determine is this check

182
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,799
fraudulent check is it a real check

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
is it a forged signature is this person

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
potentially trying to commit some kind

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,000
of financial crime such as like check

186
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,000
hiding

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
or do i just need to place this check on

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,960
hold to cover that float time

189
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,280
so that the individual who deposited the

190
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
check

191
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,559
doesn't get a loss as well as the

192
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,039
financial institution

193
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
so after i spent all that time on that i

194
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
have to go into

195
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,359
reviewing my fraud alerts and i have to

196
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
use the same due diligence or at least i

197
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,039
try to

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,198
um reviewing all the fraud alerts and i

199
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,240
just felt like there was so many

200
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,039
false positives that i was chasing and

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
i had to manually validate each one even

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,520
though

203
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,120
a lot of them i can tell just by looking

204
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,680
at them that they were false positives i

205
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,400
still had to validate them

206
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,280
so when i did find an actual fraud event

207
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,159
it was actually

208
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,239
really exciting because i felt like this

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,800
is the job that i was trained to do

210
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
and and now i actually get to go through

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
you know the procedures

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,280
of you know stopping the fraud alert and

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,599
i just thought

214
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,440
this this something has to change

215
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,719
because i know that there's fraud going

216
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
on and i know how

217
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,199
they're doing it but i'm so busy with

218
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
all these alerts that i can't

219
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,479
do anything about it so i decided to

220
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,479
change things up a little bit

221
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,720
i decided let's just focus on one thing

222
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
one thing that we know happens

223
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
every day that we identify typically

224
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
when we're

225
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,440
reviewing checks but it's not

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
necessarily something that we're

227
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,719
actively

228
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
looking for so i decided to make a

229
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
hypothesis

230
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
and start very small and say you know

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,479
adversaries

232
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,479
might be check hiding in my environment

233
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,440
so bringing carol into the story let's

234
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
say carol has a bank account at both

235
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,039
bank a

236
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,080
and bank b she has zero dollars in both

237
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,919
accounts but she decides she's gonna

238
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,240
write a check from bank a for two

239
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
hundred dollars and deposit it into bank

240
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
b

241
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,239
typically through the atm her bank

242
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,639
account would then

243
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,080
immediately show the two hundred dollars

244
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
that she just deposited

245
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,198
and then she will take cash out at the

246
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,679
atm and she gets away with the money

247
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,720
the reason that she's able to do this is

248
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,879
because in the united states in 1987

249
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
they um enacted the

250
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,039
the expedited funds availability act and

251
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,599
what this states

252
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,199
is that financial institutions have to

253
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,919
make the first 200

254
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,880
of checks available immediately or the

255
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,519
next business day

256
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,360
depending on the financial institution

257
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,560
and so you typically see a lot of check

258
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,080
hiding activities

259
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,920
in that 200 increment and

260
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
for this example i chose two different

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,479
banks which is what a lot of individuals

262
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,519
will do

263
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,920
but in my organization the story that

264
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,720
i'm going to be discussing in just a bit

265
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,880
uh carol used several accounts within

266
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,360
the same organization

267
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
and i wanted to mention one of the

268
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
greatest

269
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,120
examples of check kiting that i have

270
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,959
ever seen

271
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
is if you've ever seen the movie catch

272
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,199
me if you can

273
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,320
it's uh based upon frank abagnale

274
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,279
junior's

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
life he is a master of deception he

276
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
actually

277
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,079
co-authored the book as well as many

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,360
others that i highly recommend

279
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,360
and he at 16 he started

280
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
basically socially engineering the bank

281
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,120
tellers to cash his checks and he

282
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,040
started printing his own checks

283
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
then he started creating identities to

284
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,319
go with his checks

285
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
and it was just really interesting to

286
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
see how he

287
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
accomplished all that as a a kid

288
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
really so if you haven't heard of him i

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,720
highly recommend

290
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,720
looking him up so

291
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
i wanted to start gathering all the

292
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,360
information that i had

293
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:02,079
on um carol and and and her shenanigans

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,880
and so i knew that she's typically doing

295
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,920
it in 200

296
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,040
increments i knew that she typically

297
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
uses the atm

298
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
but then i started thinking you know how

299
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,040
would i do it if i was going to check

300
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,279
height against my organization given my

301
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,439
knowledge of the environment

302
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,519
and my co-workers were like yeah but

303
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,519
like carol's not gonna know that because

304
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,519
she doesn't know that we do that and

305
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
this i'm like yeah but what if she did

306
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
like what if carol works here

307
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
what if carol is a former employee what

308
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,279
if she's working with an employee

309
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
and so i think it's just as important

310
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,160
when you're trying to cultivate that

311
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,720
adversarial mindset

312
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,560
to look at your own knowledge of your

313
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
the inner workings of your organization

314
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,199
as well as

315
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
you know what has carol been doing in

316
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
previous incidents and

317
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
you know what is she doing in the wild

318
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,399
so we started collecting that

319
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,439
information that we could use to hunt

320
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
in our environment

321
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,240
so those are the things that we used to

322
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,719
query basically our data set to be able

323
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
to get

324
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
the information or the events uh that

325
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
were hopefully true fraud check hiding

326
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,199
events

327
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,880
um and we found a good amount of events

328
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
that were actually true fraud

329
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,079
and it was very exciting and as we

330
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
started

331
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,719
going through this process i noticed

332
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,599
that there was more things that we can

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
add

334
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,760
to our search to expand it i noticed

335
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,439
there

336
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,279
are patterns that i noticed i noticed

337
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
there's a specific age group that was

338
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,560
more popular with this financial crime

339
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,160
i noticed that a lot of the individuals

340
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,359
are using newer accounts

341
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,199
or temporary checks to to do this

342
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,560
so i used all that information i

343
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
documented it

344
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,479
and i expanded the search and what i

345
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,680
found

346
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
was a good amount of individuals that

347
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,519
may have been working together so i

348
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
decided to make

349
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,000
spreadsheets on each person and

350
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,319
personally i just used excel

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,440
i didn't have a lot of fancy tools and i

352
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
just wrote you know

353
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,839
who's writing a check to who um which

354
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
checks were bounced which ones were at

355
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,040
the atm

356
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,119
any information that i could use to see

357
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
is if anyone is connected and put

358
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
potentially working

359
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,240
together or if someone is using someone

360
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,040
without their knowledge

361
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,120
but the spreadsheets became overwhelming

362
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,680
so i really wanted to visualize

363
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,480
the data and there's also a lot of

364
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,239
visualization tools available

365
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
i was thick in the hunt at this point i

366
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
didn't want to lose traction

367
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,920
so my team and i just got out a piece of

368
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
paper and we

369
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,880
were just manually drawing something

370
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,360
similar to what you see on the screen

371
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
and what we found was a group of about

372
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
35

373
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,760
individuals that were check hiding it

374
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,320
was a fraud frame

375
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,319
they were all working it seemed like

376
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,000
with carol right at the center

377
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
and we were able to shut that down

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
close their accounts and hand that

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,000
information over to law enforcement

380
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,600
and what i found out when i was doing

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,519
that i was like man

382
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
this was so easy because we weren't

383
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
using extra resources

384
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,279
we weren't using new tools this is just

385
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
all information that we had

386
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,680
from previous incidents you know like

387
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,079
just from our own experiences in our

388
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,680
organization i thought

389
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,920
you know we could have been doing this

390
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,920
the whole time

391
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,000
and the the information that i used to

392
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,199
create my hypothesis was from previous

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,320
incidents and so i just

394
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,160
thought you know there's got to be a way

395
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
to you know automate some of this but

396
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,439
then i realized

397
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,200
some of it can be automated whereas like

398
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,200
we can update our rule sets

399
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
and and things like that to to be able

400
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,079
to inform us

401
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,000
of the things that we learn you know

402
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,638
like the 200 increments and things like

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,560
that

404
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
but then i realized as we were going

405
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,239
through our hunt

406
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
there was just too much like lateral

407
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,720
thinking that we had to do

408
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,760
so automation is an aid

409
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,079
but it can never replace human

410
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,920
driven analysis because you have to be

411
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
thinking of the bigger picture

412
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,319
um because i wasn't hunting in like a

413
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,239
simulated environment i was hunting

414
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
actively in our environment and this was

415
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,760
going on and i need to put a stop to it

416
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,959
so i had to just you know look at the

417
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,959
bigger picture

418
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,959
and make sure that i don't miss any

419
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,479
detail or who's involved to make sure

420
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,479
that all the accounts get shut down

421
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,000
so because my hypothesis came from

422
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,480
previous incidents

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
my final lesson is i i can't stress

424
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
enough

425
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,680
how important it is to go back and and

426
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,560
um

427
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,000
review or analyze previous incidents

428
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,638
that are actually true

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,720
fraud um i looked for anything that

430
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,240
could have led to earlier detection any

431
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,680
red flag

432
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
i looked what i found a lot of the

433
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,160
individuals who are pre-p

434
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,959
offenders specifically carol

435
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
she started

436
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,040
uh evolving her techniques over time and

437
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,160
she started printing her own checks that

438
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
weren't that great

439
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,760
and then she started using temporary

440
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,880
checks to purchasing checks

441
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,079
to altering purchase checks

442
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,079
and her amounts changed and

443
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
it seemed like she used different

444
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,279
techniques and were really testing our

445
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,279
defenses

446
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,439
so it didn't seem like she was working

447
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,920
with anyone on the inside

448
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,120
so that was all very useful information

449
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,319
and specifically

450
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,360
with her infrastructure not so much in

451
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,399
check hiding is it excessively important

452
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
um but for like a credit card hunt if

453
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,800
i'm looking for someone that's

454
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,040
committing credit card fraud

455
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,920
and they have let's say like a skimmer

456
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,120
or

457
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:48,240
a card printer to be able to print

458
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,000
fraudulent cards all that information is

459
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,040
extremely useful because

460
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,120
you can't defend against

461
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,719
an adversary if you don't know you know

462
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,639
what what they have what their

463
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
infrastructure is so i try to

464
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,560
document that as much as possible so

465
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,360
that we can heighten our defenses in

466
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,599
preparation

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
for that so when i moved into cyber

468
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
security

469
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,759
officially i realized a lot of the

470
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
lessons that i learned

471
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,160
um can be applied to hunting uh cyber

472
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,360
adversaries

473
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,639
so once again let's try to apply this to

474
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,040
cyber security

475
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,880
um i'm still learning as the threat

476
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,079
hunter in cyber security

477
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,680
but what i try to do is mostly simulated

478
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,959
um environments that i i i typically if

479
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,719
i find something that i want a threat

480
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,638
hunt for i'll try to replicate it

481
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,440
create an analytic that's repeatable

482
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
so one thing that i know is uh happens a

483
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
lot is

484
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,800
adversaries will typically hide macros

485
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,399
within phishing attachments and you can

486
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,439
even go more specific

487
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,519
such as like a power shell you want to

488
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,560
make sure that your hypotheses

489
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,399
are not too general because you it just

490
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
becomes overwhelming you want to start

491
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,680
small look for a single

492
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,520
technique that adversaries are using

493
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,039
and remember when you're cultivating an

494
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,439
adversarial mindset

495
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,160
and create trying to think of all the

496
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,720
things that you need

497
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
before you start hunting you want to

498
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
remember

499
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:21,760
not only to think about what carol

500
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,319
might know about your organization and

501
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,879
you know

502
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,839
based upon previous incidents you know

503
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,600
if someone's been testing your defenses

504
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
what information could they possibly

505
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,918
have found out could they

506
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,280
have used previous versions of microsoft

507
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,000
office tools

508
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,480
um all very important as well as what is

509
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,880
you know

510
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,840
what is carol's shenanigans outside the

511
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,840
organization

512
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,280
what has she been doing in the wild if

513
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,360
you see um if your hypothesis isn't

514
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,559
created from like previous incidents and

515
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,879
you just think like

516
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,000
hey there's this new threat group i

517
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,960
think they might be targeting our

518
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,480
organization

519
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,880
and you want to specifically hunt for

520
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,400
you know some of their techniques you

521
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,320
know definitely

522
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
what i like to i like to utilize the

523
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,678
miter attack uh

524
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,360
knowledge base and you can go and look

525
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,640
at uh all that because it's

526
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,320
freely available and see you know

527
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
if you're using the you can use the

528
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
cyber analytics repository or you can

529
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,039
just look at the techniques and try to

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,399
replicate them

531
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,320
um and then if carol is an uh

532
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,240
insider you also have to think you know

533
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,439
she might be aware of

534
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,600
the organization's macro policies or the

535
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,039
you know how to craft an email that will

536
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
most likely be opened

537
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,640
uh by someone in your organization and

538
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,320
you don't want to assume you know if

539
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,960
someone in your organization

540
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,918
is involved they might not be involved

541
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,440
voluntarily

542
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,600
they might be uh you know unaware

543
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,799
uh or they might be actively doing it so

544
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,280
you just have to keep all those things

545
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,559
in mind

546
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,559
when you're hunting and you can also use

547
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,240
like two different um

548
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,399
you can do like two different hunts like

549
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,360
if you have all this information

550
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,240
that is insider information you could do

551
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,080
like an insider hunt for this technique

552
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,520
given the knowledge that you have of the

553
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,918
inner workings and then

554
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,120
you know based on external resources or

555
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,799
previous incidents

556
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,280
and and look for those types of

557
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
techniques

558
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,280
so in the event you are utilizing like i

559
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,720
said an

560
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,678
external uh threat group or a

561
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,600
technique that's being used you can

562
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,760
utilize the attack navigator whether

563
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,000
it's something that is already in the

564
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,840
miter attack knowledge base or if you

565
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,919
need to create a new

566
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,360
um adversary profile based upon

567
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
you know something that you're seeing in

568
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,320
your environment or something that may

569
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,760
not be in the knowledge base

570
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,799
you can use a blank uh layer of the

571
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,400
navigator

572
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,000
that's available on the attack website

573
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
um if you're not comfortable with the

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,640
attack navigator um

575
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,879
i know it's changed a lot you can also

576
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,400
just use spreadsheets i personally

577
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,400
feel like there's nothing excel can't do

578
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,880
so when you're creating your processes

579
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,480
in cyber security i find that it's a

580
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,039
a lot more important to document it

581
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,600
personally i have adhd and i forget

582
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
everything

583
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,678
if i don't write it down so i have to be

584
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,960
able to

585
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,200
remember certain analytics that i

586
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,120
create certain filters that i create so

587
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,280
i try to document all of it

588
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,840
there's certain times when you have to

589
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,918
filter out certain parent processes

590
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,678
and and and so on because it's you know

591
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,480
if it's a system account

592
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,080
if you're once you start going in and

593
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,679
and hunting for things in the logs

594
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,320
you'll start to identify

595
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,400
little tricks and and whatnot and i like

596
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,080
to save all of my queries and filters

597
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,440
that i find useful because

598
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,879
if it's not useful for it's well

599
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,559
it's going to be useful for you in the

600
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,000
future i promise but if you're working

601
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,000
with a team of hunters

602
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,080
it will most likely be useful for them

603
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,840
too to be able to just go through it

604
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
really quickly

605
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,799
for visualization if you don't want to

606
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,520
use my old school method

607
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,520
of writing it out on a piece of paper i

608
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,120
personally love using

609
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,240
the misp project it is open source

610
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,799
project

611
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,280
i have an example from the miss project

612
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,639
of their correlation graph

613
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
and the mist can be used for multiple

614
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,520
different industries

615
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,480
we actually used it um in uh the

616
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,840
financial institution eventually um we

617
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,080
implemented it so you can

618
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,520
do all sorts of indicators you can

619
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
create your own graphs

620
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
and the one thing i like about it the

621
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,960
most is it has an automatic correlation

622
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,120
engine on the back end

623
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
so it'll actually correlate the things

624
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,719
the indicators

625
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,760
that are matching from different events

626
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
um

627
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,000
and so i i personally really love it

628
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,080
because it's really easy to use

629
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
really easy to deploy and it's open

630
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:05,120
source so it doesn't require a whole lot

631
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,159
and then if you're not um

632
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,600
actively working on instant response

633
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,280
or if like say you're creating an

634
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
analytic and then handing it over to

635
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,840
another team for them to use

636
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,600
um try to get this much information back

637
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,120
from that team such as you know if such

638
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,320
as incident response try

639
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,840
to allow them to inform you of

640
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,520
you know the times of techniques that

641
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,280
they're seeing what's evading detection

642
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,760
all that information because it's going

643
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,639
to be useful for you

644
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,080
going into your hunt and if you do while

645
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,880
you're hunting if you are hunting

646
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,600
in an active environment try to identify

647
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,360
the types

648
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,280
of techniques that are happen

649
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,360
try to analyze the behaviors leading up

650
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,360
to detection see if you can identify

651
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
anything that can heighten your security

652
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,120
controls to be able to detect it sooner

653
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,199
anything about the adversary's

654
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,799
infrastructure you know is very

655
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,039
important because if you're getting

656
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,639
you know hit with a nation state or you

657
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
know you want to be able to identify

658
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,440
what does their infrastructure look like

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,120
what are their resources is this

660
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
possibly a team of people

661
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,719
is this a script kitty all very

662
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,600
important things to document that can

663
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,080
help you

664
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:17,039
with future hunts so just to review

665
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,840
um if i didn't say my lessons enough

666
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,720
when you're

667
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
getting into hunting focus on one thing

668
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,520
start small

669
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,360
create a hypothesis try to make it as

670
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
specific as possible

671
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,199
and while you're creating your

672
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,600
hypothesis and going through creating

673
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
your analytics you might find

674
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,678
you might you know get ideas for future

675
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,080
hunts but try not to get scope creep and

676
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,640
just you know document that for future

677
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,320
hunts um you don't want to chase the

678
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,200
shiny things

679
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,200
um and then when you're cultivating an

680
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,880
adversarial mindset just remember it's

681
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
50 50. 50

682
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,159
your knowledge of the inner workings of

683
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,559
your organization as well as

684
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,000
you know what is carol doing what your

685
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,480
assumptions are

686
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
of their knowledge of your environment

687
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
and then document

688
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,360
everything it's extremely useful

689
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
especially if you're working with law

690
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
enforcement

691
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,880
and visualize your findings this isn't

692
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,879
for everyone but i personally like to

693
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,679
visualize data so that i can analyze it

694
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,679
better

695
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,520
and then don't forget to you know

696
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,960
analyze the behaviors

697
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,120
uh of an incident and and identify

698
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
um anything that could lead to earlier

699
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,039
detection or anything

700
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,760
that you can take that's actionable for

701
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,440
your team

702
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,440
to be able to prevent this in the future

703
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,399
