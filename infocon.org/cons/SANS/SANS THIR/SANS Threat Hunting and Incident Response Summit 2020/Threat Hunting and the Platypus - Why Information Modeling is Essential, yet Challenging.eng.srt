1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,000
um

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,879
so i'm excited to introduce uh jason

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,719
kierstead who is coming to us from ibm

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,000
and what i was most interested in about

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,160
this submission was not

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,359
just the concept of a platypus which

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
let's face it i mean that's

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
going to get attention when when you see

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,400
that come up in your your cfp

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,480
submissions but was actually his role um

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,799
an architect of threat management

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,280
and he's as i said at ibm and managing

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,880
for the threat life cycle is something

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
that a lot of us don't think of

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,840
at first when we think of threat hunting

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,199
because you think of threat hunting as

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
the activity that

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,800
we're going to do going out and

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,360
searching for

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,038
uh activity or artifacts and logs or any

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
other art evidence

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,960
however threat management brings this

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
into a much broader picture

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
so i'm really excited to hear this talk

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,239
specifically because we're talking about

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,039
data modeling information modeling here

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,440
talking about

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
how to deal with the threat as an entity

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
instead of the hunt

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,960
as just an activity so um with that all

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,680
said i'm very excited to

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,399
turn this over to uh to jason and uh

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,320
excited to

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
hear more about the platypus as well so

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,960
take it away sir

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,479
okay uh thanks a lot phil um my name's

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
uh jason kirsten

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,840
uh widely known in some communities as

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
jk um

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,479
i'm the cto of threat management for ibm

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
security as well mentioned and i helped

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,119
drive the

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
the technical direction of our whole

44
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,920
portfolio in threat detection and

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
response

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
i'm also the co-chair of the open cyber

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
security alliance project governing

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,720
board

49
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,158
and first i want to thank you guys all

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
for taking a few minutes of your day to

51
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,360
listen to me ramble on about information

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
modeling

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,880
um what is it exactly why should you

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
care about it

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
uh common challenges that i see

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
associated with it

57
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,960
and i hope to share a few ideas on how

58
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
to overcome some of those challenges

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,880
a couple of the different angles that

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,039
i'm going to talk about

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
may not necessarily be new news to some

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
folks but i can tell you from my

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
experience

64
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,600
dealing with fortune 100 class

65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,598
organizations all over the place that

66
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
there is still a very long journey ahead

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,519
in this specific space

68
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,879
around information modeling if we want

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,319
to get things to where

70
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,040
i believe we need them to be in the

71
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,440
industry and along the way we'll learn a

72
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,760
little bit about biology perhaps as well

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,599
and

74
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,959
platypus and whatnot although i want to

75
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
make it very clear everyone i don't

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
claim to be

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,400
a biologist by any in any sense of the

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,400
word

79
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,519
so i want to start this talk off

80
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,360
with uh quote that i really like

81
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,480
it's called there is no ai without ia

82
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,720
and in in this context ia stands for

83
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,160
information architecture number

84
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
different people have said this over the

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,079
years but the earliest reference i could

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,440
ever find to this is by an ai expert his

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,319
name is seth earley

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
and he said this in 2016. what this

89
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,958
quote is referring to

90
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,200
is the importance of having a

91
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
well-defined information architecture if

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,238
you ever want to be able to do

93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,359
something as complicated as machine

94
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,360
learning it's not an optional step

95
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
i'd argue when you're trying to develop

96
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
machine learning and it's also not an

97
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
optional step if you want to do anything

98
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
advanced in cyber security

99
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,159
why it's pretty simple you can't teach

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,080
something that you don't already

101
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,879
understand yourself

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,599
and that holds as much truth as much

103
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,518
from machines as it does for people

104
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,359
and this whole idea of understanding

105
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
your data understanding what it looks

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,159
like what it feels like what it smells

107
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,879
like

108
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,000
is really fundamental to building a

109
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,120
cyber security information architecture

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
so just let's let's set some table

111
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
stakes first

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,879
what is an information architecture jk

113
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,879
what are you talking about

114
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,920
in short information architecture it's

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,000
the design

116
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
and organization of information so that

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,840
it can reliably support

118
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
things like findability usability

119
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,640
analytics takes into account

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,879
data curation validating the data

121
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
in some cases not really relevant for

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,840
cyber security but it takes an account

123
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,720
translation

124
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
normalizing the data cleansing the data

125
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,560
without a proper information

126
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,798
architecture around your data

127
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,478
it tends to not look the same it can be

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,440
stored in different places

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,000
different apis to query it there's

130
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,080
different models of the data

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,199
it becomes very hard to work with and

132
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,199
things like building

133
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,600
analytics and machine learning on top of

134
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,919
that data gets very difficult

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
so my question is does this sound

136
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
familiar

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
to you because it to me this is the

138
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
world that we live in

139
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,960
every day in cyber security operations

140
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
we run into this stuff when we're

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
ingesting data when we're correlating it

142
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,320
when we're hunting

143
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,719
when we're responding to incidents

144
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,599
because none of the tools in our huge

145
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,960
arsenal

146
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,880
they don't tend to speak the same

147
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,159
language the log sources don't tend to

148
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
look the same

149
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
the analytics don't work from tool to

150
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,639
tool everyone's speaking a different

151
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,479
language

152
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,320
and it's the root pro it's one of the

153
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,758
root problems of a lot of challenges in

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,560
cyber security

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,880
it's why extracting you know real

156
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,759
actionable value from something like a

157
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,960
large sim or data lake can be so hard

158
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,680
it's why analysts you know who's become

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
an expert in one tool chain

160
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,320
can't necessarily easily port those

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,120
skills over to another which then plays

162
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
into

163
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
you know we hear a lot about this

164
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,599
mythical

165
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,520
well depending on who you talk to

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
mythical cyber security data

167
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
cyber security skills gap um this is a

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
big part of it

169
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,840
right when your skills are not easily

170
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,758
portable from tool to tool

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,560
and from employer to employer

172
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,680
it makes the overall talent pool a lot a

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:56,720
lot smaller

174
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,039
so i want to start this

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,960
um with a better understanding of

176
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,120
of how information architectures work by

177
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
tying it to an information architecture

178
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
that

179
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
i think many would be at least somewhat

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,720
perfectly familiar with

181
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,359
and that's taxonomy and biology

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
taxonomy is basically the science of

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
creating an ia

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
for all life on earth why do we need

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,639
a taxonomy for life why was this thing

186
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,039
ever developed it's simple really

187
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,960
as humans we really really really like

188
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,680
to group things to explain them to each

189
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
other

190
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
uh in fact this whole science of

191
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
taxonomy it's

192
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
it's been referred to before the world's

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,318
oldest profession apparently by

194
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
people who aren't familiar with the

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
other world's oldest profession

196
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,440
but the point is we've been doing this

197
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,919
for a millennia um

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,719
modern taxonomy however it traces back

199
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,599
to about 1735 by the swedish botanist

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,880
named carl

201
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,440
linnius developed it so i want you to

202
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,120
think about how important taxonomy is

203
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,199
to um to this area of science

204
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,960
imagine you went to an island that

205
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
discovered a new creature

206
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,359
and you had to describe that creature to

207
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,960
someone if you didn't have taxonomy if

208
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,039
you didn't have a common way to

209
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,080
to talk about what that animal's

210
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,159
characteristics are

211
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
the whole conversation would become

212
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,759
extremely challenging and that's why

213
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,080
information architecture is so important

214
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
if you don't have a roughly agreed upon

215
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,880
information architecture

216
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,198
it's not possible to have proper

217
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,599
communications

218
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
now i'm not going to spend an inordinate

219
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
amount of time on

220
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
on this whole idea of biology and

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,359
taxonomy in this talk so

222
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
so don't don't be worried too much here

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,479
um but on the left

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,840
you can see the rough um hierarchy of

225
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
taxonomy with

226
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
groupings that you're probably at least

227
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,240
peripherally familiar with

228
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
um note earlier however that i said

229
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
rough

230
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,879
agreement on information architecture

231
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
and

232
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
the reason that that's important is

233
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,800
because

234
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,919
even in an incredibly mature domain like

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,599
biology

236
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,799
something that's been around for

237
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,360
hundreds of years as i said two specs

238
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,160
70-35

239
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,440
um there's still today a continual

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,240
evolutionist information architecture

241
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
multiple taxonomies can often be in use

242
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,919
by subsets

243
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
of this community until over time the

244
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,000
architectures come to a consensus and

245
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,960
start to converge

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
below you can see a rough timeline i

247
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,120
created

248
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
by doing some research around this these

249
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
are

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,640
at the domain and kingdom level what you

251
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
see here in the slide

252
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,559
that's the absolute bottom level of the

253
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
pre previous pyramid on

254
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,079
um so you know think about how

255
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
interesting this is that you know

256
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,600
we're still trying to sort out hundreds

257
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
and hundreds of years after the science

258
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
was created

259
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,399
what the most basic high-level groupings

260
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
of life should be

261
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
um and that's because we're constantly

262
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,279
learning and discovering new features

263
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
of microorganisms and whatnot i find

264
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,279
this whole thing

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,200
fascinating but i can already kind of

266
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,000
hear what you guys are thinking

267
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,080
you know thanks a lot dr science but you

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,760
know what on earth does all this have to

269
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,959
do with threat hunting and cyber

270
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,080
security

271
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,839
um so

272
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,839
i'll tell you what it has to do with

273
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,640
cyber security it's because when we're

274
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
hunting

275
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,360
and when we're developing detections we

276
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,720
really want to detect

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
things not strings um

278
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,120
and and i love this this quote this idea

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
of things not strings and we're going to

280
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,519
come back to this

281
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,600
a couple of different times um so

282
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,519
we just spent a bunch of time talking

283
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,920
about these information models what they

284
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
are

285
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
and now i'm going to tell you why

286
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,920
they're vital in cyber security

287
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,000
first of all let's talk about the

288
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,439
normalization of data

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,440
why is normalizing data important well

290
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
i talked about this a little bit when i

291
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
was talking about information

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,760
architectures but to recap

293
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
first of all there's no widely adopted

294
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,680
standard

295
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,839
for security event logging nothing

296
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,760
that you know nada i've been at the

297
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,680
focus of this whole area of the industry

298
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,680
for about 15 years and i can tell you

299
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,519
we're barely further ahead today than we

300
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,560
were even 15 years ago

301
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
it's still the total wild west why

302
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,319
why is this it's a combination of

303
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,360
different factors there's a lack of

304
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
market pressure

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
there's developer complacency and a

306
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,959
bunch of other things that play

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
but there's there's a silver lining here

308
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,040
and that's

309
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,319
uh cloud cloud is helping a little bit

310
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,199
um because of um

311
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
when you build detections against the

312
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,880
cloud

313
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,880
the major cloud vendors are somewhat

314
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,839
normalizing that data because so many

315
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,480
things are built on top of their apis

316
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,519
um so that's you know a little bit of uh

317
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
a cost right you're we're coming to

318
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,920
normalization but it's at the cost of

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,800
over

320
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,800
centralization

321
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,160
second point here and it contradicts the

322
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,040
first a little bit

323
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,519
and that's that public cloud vendors

324
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,079
can't

325
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,600
and likely will never agree on what

326
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
their data should look like when you

327
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,680
pull it out of them

328
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,959
um their platform specific security

329
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
tools that they build against these

330
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,479
clouds they don't tend to agree on data

331
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,240
formats and what the data coming out of

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
them is supposed to look like and it's

333
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,040
unlikely they'll ever agree because

334
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
frankly there's little

335
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,240
pressure in the marketplace for them to

336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
do this

337
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
uh as such you've kind of got this

338
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,120
situation where you've got momentum

339
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,399
towards the marked improvement like i

340
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
talked about before

341
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,560
but it's at the cost of this known

342
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
ceiling on how well this is ever going

343
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,279
to end up

344
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,120
because they're you know those three to

345
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,720
four major public cloud vendors

346
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,200
are unlikely to produce um

347
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,360
another reason that this is important is

348
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,720
some cost and existing and detection

349
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,959
analytics so

350
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
when you've sent spent a lot of time

351
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,479
money and effort building detections

352
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
that's a sunk cost that you don't want

353
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
to waste

354
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
and finally you know we all have to

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,200
recognize

356
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,599
that this same cyber security startup

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,399
culture that rewards the churning out of

358
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
innovation

359
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,519
all the time it doesn't necessarily

360
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
weigh

361
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,839
enough on long-term supportability

362
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,760
um and things like using existing data

363
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,200
models to make sure that your tools work

364
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,200
properly with all the others

365
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,120
so why is normalizing

366
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,319
data something that you would need when

367
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,760
you're developing

368
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,240
hunts and detections first there's

369
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
extensibility if you build your

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,399
detections and analytics

371
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,480
on a normalized data model it's a lot

372
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,399
easier to combine and mix those

373
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,800
detections into new ones

374
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,519
because all the detections share the

375
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,240
same underlying data model

376
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,519
second is this idea of portability and

377
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,360
reuse

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,120
the ability to have your detections and

379
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
skills be able to move from data

380
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
to data source and tool to tool it's

381
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,639
incredibly valuable and can save you a

382
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
lot of time when you're doing

383
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,959
investigations

384
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,959
this also plays into the earlier skills

385
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,599
gap area that we mentioned earlier and

386
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,638
widening that talent pool

387
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
finally uh we've got collaboration um

388
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,480
thankfully we're starting to see an

389
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
incredibly increased movement around

390
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
community development of detections

391
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,719
um you know i can't be more pleased that

392
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
we're finally starting to see this after

393
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
a lot of years

394
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
collaboration around analytics and

395
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,599
detections however it's it's really

396
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,160
difficult

397
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
if everyone in a certain community

398
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
aren't speaking the same language

399
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
because they're not using the same tools

400
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,120
and then the same tool chain and their

401
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,480
data looks different

402
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
so that that can sometimes lead to folks

403
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
not being able to

404
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,839
equally participate um because

405
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,680
the they don't use the same data models

406
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,560
and the power of the crowd is then

407
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,199
diminished

408
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,199
in that case

409
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,160
so all that sounds great interesting

410
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
this is a really important thing to do

411
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,519
but

412
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,760
i'll tell you it's it's a lot easier

413
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,079
said than done

414
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
in practice there's many real world

415
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,399
challenges that you're going to face

416
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,920
in this whole area of trying to align

417
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,760
your data to an information architecture

418
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,279
so let's start going over those and

419
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,959
we'll start with

420
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,959
some of the basics first of all

421
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,800
if you're going to try to align to a

422
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,119
data model which one

423
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,959
should you be trying to align to there

424
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,600
are a lot of different information

425
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
models that exist in cyber security

426
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
some of them are here on the slide but

427
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,599
there's actually a lot more than these

428
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
and each one of these is a data model

429
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,360
that you can map your data to and from

430
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,639
in order to normalize it

431
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
why do so many of these exist well

432
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
you know i'm sure people are familiar

433
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
with this xkdcd

434
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,959
xkcd comic which i uh you know i pull

435
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
out

436
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,800
very often um this whole one about the

437
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
standards and how they proliferate but

438
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,639
in all seriousness

439
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,360
you know we we could participate all day

440
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
about

441
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,639
how we got to this place and why we

442
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,079
continue to have new

443
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,079
and more models and can't get to a

444
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,079
consensus but the fact is

445
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,079
all these models are out there and they

446
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,479
are popular in their own domains and

447
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,560
they have very important use cases

448
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,920
so they're not going anywhere anywhere

449
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,359
anytime soon

450
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,920
there's not going to be like this

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,199
massive consolidation of data models

452
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,800
it's just a pipe dream so getting back

453
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:45,359
to the question

454
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,359
how do you choose um

455
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
first of all we're i'm not going to

456
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
spend

457
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,120
a lot of time going through all the

458
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,319
minutia comparing and contrasting all of

459
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
these models

460
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
i was originally thinking about doing

461
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,079
some of that in this talk but then i

462
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,120
realized i only have 25 minutes

463
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,279
and that would probably take us all day

464
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,320
so instead i want to talk more at a high

465
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
level about

466
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,519
how to choose a model that you want to

467
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
map your data to

468
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,920
and what things you got to think about

469
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,399
first

470
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,479
do you have any influence at all on the

471
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
source data

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,720
you know i i still run across people who

473
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,560
don't necessarily

474
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,360
realize this that

475
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,880
it is possible to change the output

476
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,160
formats and data models of

477
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,759
many different cyber security tools and

478
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,360
if you have the ability to influence

479
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,560
that inside your environment

480
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,440
if you can ask them to change the the

481
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,319
data format

482
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,320
on these these these devices and these

483
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
sensors before it gets to you

484
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
it can be incredibly useful and

485
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,399
incredibly powerful to

486
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
to exert some of that influence and

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,160
achieve that alignment

488
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
the second thing to think about is what

489
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,920
is your tool chain

490
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
um does your tool chain work best with a

491
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,199
preferred data model

492
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,119
i'm going to pick an elastic search here

493
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,839
for a second because

494
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
it's an extremely popular open source

495
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,799
tool

496
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,839
in this community and elastic last year

497
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,280
released this ecs data model which is

498
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,720
incredibly powerful

499
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,879
um yet you know i still don't see

500
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,559
a huge uptake of it in the cyber

501
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,839
security community and this is something

502
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,399
i'd really like to see

503
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,120
more threat hunters and more folks who

504
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,039
are standing up

505
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,799
elk stacks take a much closer look at

506
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,400
you know people are still somewhat

507
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,400
blindly throwing all their data in an

508
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,080
elastic search and then trying to

509
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,480
extract value out of it on the other

510
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,678
side and if a little bit of effort can

511
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
be spent

512
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,400
on that data curation in advance to map

513
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,760
it to something like ecs you can reap

514
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,679
enormous rewards from it

515
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
second thing to think about is what are

516
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,880
your use cases

517
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,720
the best the best path and model

518
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,200
on how you should do things for

519
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,240
real-time detections it might not be

520
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,360
what you want to do for threat hunting

521
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,320
um one thing i'd caution though is that

522
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
when you're when you're

523
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,240
looking at all this stuff keep in mind

524
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
that if you start at one

525
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,640
you're probably going to end up wanting

526
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,799
to use this data for the other use case

527
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,320
so really from the start if at all

528
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,000
possible you should be trying to

529
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,159
take into account both real-time

530
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,520
detection and instant response and

531
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
threat hunting when you're doing this

532
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
exercise

533
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
um what's the level of expertise in your

534
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
organization

535
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,159
if everyone on your team is a wizard

536
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,799
with cim then

537
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
not using that as your standard model

538
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,160
you know obviously doesn't make a lot of

539
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
sense because you know it's it's

540
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,440
gonna be a huge lift for you to go and

541
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,880
and retrain

542
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,480
you know a whole steward of people um

543
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,559
what are your use cases um finally

544
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
you know back to the power of the crowd

545
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,320
are there communities

546
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,000
that your team is involved with that you

547
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,000
plan to leverage

548
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,840
if those communities exist where's their

549
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,360
expertise what models

550
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,360
are most popular in that community um

551
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,520
this is something that's very important

552
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,918
do you have existing content in

553
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,960
or analytics you want to leverage or do

554
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
you plan to

555
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,280
you know mainly base this around a

556
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,280
community

557
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,520
so let's pivot back a little bit to the

558
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,918
whole biology

559
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,679
point and you know this is i hope a

560
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
little bit of a fun exercise that

561
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,039
illustrates the second challenge you're

562
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,160
going to face on this journey

563
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,840
um this is a picture of the platypus so

564
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,000
if you think back to our earlier

565
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
conversation on taxonomy

566
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,760
how do you think the platypus ends up

567
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,600
getting classified

568
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
it's it's a mammal right it's obviously

569
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,159
a mammal it is fur it produces milk

570
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
weight

571
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,520
maybe it's a bird after all birds lay

572
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,240
eggs they have

573
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
bill wait wait a second he's got

574
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,520
poisonous spikes

575
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,360
and he has an electrosensory system

576
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,879
those are those are typically

577
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:06,399
uh characteristics of a reptile um

578
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,840
you know how was it classified when it

579
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,080
was first discovered

580
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,199
it's totally non-obvious what this

581
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,799
animal should be

582
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,720
and the only real solution to try to

583
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,840
figure out what it is is to

584
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,080
model all of its attributes according to

585
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
your taxonomy model and see where it

586
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,879
falls according to your information

587
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,520
architecture

588
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,400
you can't just take like a wild swag at

589
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
it and expect it

590
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
to come out with good results um so what

591
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,959
does this have to do with threat hunting

592
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
and by the way for anyone

593
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
actually interested that class was is a

594
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,640
mammal

595
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,600
um so what does this have to do with

596
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,600
threat hunting so

597
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,918
hopefully you know a lot of folks will

598
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,639
recognize what this is in the screen

599
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,360
this is just a typical uh microsoft

600
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,799
sysmon events that's pretty obvious

601
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
um my question's a little bit more

602
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,280
fundamental than that though

603
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,639
how do you model this data and to be

604
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,639
clear you know this is nothing

605
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,600
interesting this is just this this month

606
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,799
i grabbed from a quick google query to

607
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,080
build this presentation

608
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,200
it's nothing exciting but

609
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,720
what is this the the answer is

610
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,320
it's not any one type of data it has

611
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
lots of different features

612
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,158
it's an endpoint log it's a log of

613
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,799
process activity

614
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,280
it's a network flow it's also a file

615
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,158
record

616
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,360
it's all these things at the same time

617
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,280
what it isn't

618
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,360
however is windows event id3

619
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,720
and you know technically it is windows

620
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
event id3

621
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
um but that is actually the most

622
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,559
unimportant piece of data here

623
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,719
despite the fact that map

624
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,480
detecting and searching based on windows

625
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,919
event id it's one of the most commonly

626
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,360
referenced things when people are

627
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,200
talking about detections

628
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,719
and investigations you know oh you want

629
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
to go and look for this

630
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,280
activity you're looking for windows

631
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,158
event 285 or whatever

632
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,879
um remember earlier when i mentioned we

633
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,679
want to find

634
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
things not strings and this is why this

635
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,919
conversation is important

636
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,799
and it's really the crux of this this

637
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,640
entire

638
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,639
talk um if we're doing threat hunting

639
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
looking for things like say specific

640
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,240
windows event ids and i don't want to

641
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,440
focus too much on one of those id but

642
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,840
there's there's a number of different

643
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
things

644
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,959
of this nature if we're looking for if

645
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,840
we're looking for

646
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,080
not the data that's in the record but

647
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,080
we're looking for the record itself

648
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,720
then we've lost all of the benefits of

649
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,439
modeling the data in the first place

650
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,200
suppose for a second that this ttp

651
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,280
whatever whatever's going on the sysmon

652
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,159
event this ttp

653
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,840
had been involved in a virtual machine

654
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,280
and it was recorded by a cloud workload

655
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,439
protection solution

656
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,678
instead of sysmon and you got the data

657
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,280
that way you've got the same process

658
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,960
that's doing the same things

659
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,879
it's aggressing to the same network

660
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,400
location but because it's not coming

661
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
from sysmon anymore

662
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
the data is going to look very different

663
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,360
and if you had built a bunch of

664
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,600
detections or hunts

665
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,039
around the sysmon event none of them are

666
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,399
going to pick that up

667
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,799
just because you're now getting that

668
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,480
information from a different tool

669
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,120
um and that's that's really the crux of

670
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,559
this

671
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,000
when we talk about things not strings um

672
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,240
you know you really want to be looking

673
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,320
for the data as modeled

674
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,320
not the raw data itself

675
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,320
um it does not do to leave

676
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,439
a live dragon out of its calc out of

677
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,918
your calculations

678
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,120
if you live near him what does this

679
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,840
quote mean it means that

680
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,879
factoring in a highly probable future

681
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,799
scenario

682
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
even if that scenario isn't really

683
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,679
assured is something that's very purging

684
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
to do

685
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,400
in other words take a beat to plan ahead

686
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,679
when you're building your detections

687
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
when you're working on your hunting

688
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,279
playbooks

689
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,440
take some time try to build those things

690
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,760
around a well-defined data model instead

691
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,919
of the raw data if at all possible

692
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,360
if you can do that over time it's going

693
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,000
to re you're going to read major

694
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,360
dividends

695
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,600
in your environment um

696
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,199
finally a couple of best practice

697
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,959
guidelines some of these things are a

698
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,320
little bit basic

699
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
and some people in this talk may have

700
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,879
heard these things a million times but

701
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,559
on the other hand you know

702
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,320
as i mentioned at the beginning this i

703
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,760
still see in

704
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,279
in fortune 100 stuff level organizations

705
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,879
there's so many people still struggling

706
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
with some of these basics so

707
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,279
i don't mind repeating them first of all

708
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,879
try to make your detections generic look

709
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,320
for the ttps if you can

710
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,960
don't look just at the iocs um

711
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,520
i another way to talk about this is look

712
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,679
for the payload not the envelope

713
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,559
it's another way to say the the whole

714
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,600
thing's not strings conversation

715
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,678
we want to look for that actual model

716
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,199
data not the envelope it's been

717
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,679
delivered in

718
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,320
look for threat signals not os signals

719
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,559
what do i mean by this

720
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,399
you know ttps increasingly you can

721
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,440
figure out ways to do this that are

722
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,799
platform at os

723
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,480
agnostic and you know while this is a

724
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,600
little bit more rare

725
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,640
um that that a given ttp can

726
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,399
you know cross os boundaries as we

727
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,400
migrate to increasingly virtual

728
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,640
environments and our applications are

729
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,120
all delivered to us via the cloud

730
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,880
um you know or we're as an example right

731
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,959
now with covid there's there's an

732
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,960
enormous uptake in remote work and

733
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,080
remotely delivered applications that are

734
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,400
running on

735
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,760
single purpose vms and shipped off to

736
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
the endpoints

737
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
so as you start to get look in this

738
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,559
world

739
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,480
you know it's going to become more and

740
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
more important because

741
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,400
the ways that you get visibility in

742
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,200
these environments are very different

743
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,600
and if you're doing things with blinders

744
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,600
on

745
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,840
trying to build things with platform

746
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,240
specific use cases it can really limit

747
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
your

748
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,000
your whole visibility uh finally you

749
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,400
know

750
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,919
test test test this is always a best

751
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,799
practice for pretty much anything you

752
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,840
ever do

753
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,918
in a technical area um but you know

754
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,760
echo it again for detections you have to

755
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,559
test this whole test detections like

756
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,039
crazy

757
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,760
and then again you know planning ahead

758
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,158
um taking shortcuts in this area

759
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,120
you know it usually ends up you having

760
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,440
to go back

761
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,840
and redo it later at some point in time

762
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,360
either as you grow or as you onboard

763
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,840
new tools or what have you so and and

764
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,600
you know and some of this data you you

765
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,678
want to keep it for a long time

766
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,879
right so having to go back and remodel

767
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,880
that data is painful

768
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,158
so what's the next frontier um before i

769
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,879
wrap this up

770
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,360
i want to outline something that i see

771
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,320
as

772
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,479
as the future and that's not just the

773
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,600
common data model the common hunting and

774
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,240
analytics languages themselves

775
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,158
why why do we need this it's it's the

776
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,320
same reasons that we're looking at

777
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,600
common information architectures

778
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,760
um you know lack of of folks that have

779
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,959
the right skills you know this enormous

780
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,600
volume of data

781
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,440
that's coming out of the cloud this this

782
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,520
need for collaboration

783
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
around detections and analytics in the

784
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,440
community

785
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,279
being able to detect things and write

786
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,880
hunting playbooks and express

787
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,279
complex analytics in one open source

788
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,520
language that you could then use on any

789
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,240
different cyber security tool chain

790
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,158
that's now a world where you can have

791
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,440
ultimate reuse and ultimate community

792
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,520
collaboration

793
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,559
because everyone can start cooperating

794
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,600
on next level detections and next level

795
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,720
use cases um without worrying about

796
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,760
whether or not

797
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,440
this this complicated query that is

798
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,240
going to work in this sim or the other

799
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,600
sim or this

800
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,120
xdr tool or you know against this data

801
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,480
that's running in this elasticsearch

802
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,479
cluster

803
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,000
the this kind of may sound a little bit

804
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,880
too good to be true but

805
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,720
i don't believe that it is we're very

806
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,679
rapidly approaching this case there's a

807
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,440
lot of momentum

808
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,799
in the space and there's some exciting

809
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,919
things that are going

810
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,879
on in this area um and i you know i

811
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
strongly

812
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,039
uh implore everyone you know take a look

813
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,879
at what it's out there what's going on

814
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,080
because it's very exciting

815
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,760
um to close i'm going to

816
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,678
leave you with a few different resources

817
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,600
you can draw on if this whole

818
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,720
topic was interesting to you if you want

819
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,360
to dive into the space

820
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,600
more first i recommend checking out you

821
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,439
know uncoded i o and the sigma project

822
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
that you know some folks earlier today

823
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
we're talking with sigma if you're not

824
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,039
familiar with it it's a very powerful

825
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,199
tool in this domain

826
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,720
um it although it maps a little bit more

827
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,520
into the detection space you can

828
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
actually also use it when you're hunting

829
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
next i'd be remiss if i didn't call out

830
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,039
our own

831
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,480
stick shifter project in the open cyber

832
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,158
security alliance

833
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,600
stix shifter is trying to solve for a

834
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,520
lot of these same challenges that i

835
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,320
outlined in this presentation

836
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,760
and it's trying to do that by giving

837
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,120
getting into a place that you don't have

838
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,960
to worry so much

839
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,959
about the data model you ingest because

840
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
it's up leveling that problem up to the

841
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
analytics layer

842
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,000
i also mentioned elastic common schema

843
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,399
if you're

844
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,320
using elasticsearch in your organization

845
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,158
um in any way and you're not using

846
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
elastic common schema

847
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,080
you know you don't know what you're

848
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,719
missing so take a look at that

849
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,279
finally check out the miter car project

850
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,799

851
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,039
for folks who don't know stands for

852
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,879
cyber analytics repository

853
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,559
um this is an effort by mitre to build

854
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,279
one of their own aforementioned

855
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,559

856
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,559
for detections um and car actually has

857
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,480
its own data model as well

858
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
although a lot of the detections in that

859
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,399
community um

860
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,120
also have mappings to other data models

861
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,120

modeling with platypuses and a bunch of

867
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,080
other stuff

868
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,000
