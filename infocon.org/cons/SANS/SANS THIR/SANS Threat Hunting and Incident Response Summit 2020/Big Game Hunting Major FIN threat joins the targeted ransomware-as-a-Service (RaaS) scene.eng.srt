1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,040
big

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,840
game hunting major finn threat joins the

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,360
targeted ransomware as a service

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,680
scene via a valik partnership

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
i'm not gonna lie there's a lot of

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
keywords inside of there that are meant

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
to

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,198
uh probably trigger your malware

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,279
detection system

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
if you weren't noticing but uh the one

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,560
that caught me was big game hunty no i'm

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
excited about this one um i've done a

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
lot of financially motivated crime

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,199
investigations in my time

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
and when we saw this one come through

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,559
not only was i super taken aback by it

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
but i was also really excited because

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,360
we've got some folks from ibm's

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,199
iris x-force iris team and they usually

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,320
do some awesome awesome work and provide

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
great insight for the

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,840
those of us in the community here so

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
without further delay

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
john dwyer christopher kiever are you

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,800
with us

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
yep awesome there we go all right

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,640
take it away guys looking forward to it

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,640
this year the uh the stage is all yours

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
i'm john dwyer and i'm joined here by

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,959
chris kieffer and today i want to talk a

31
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
little bit about uh

32
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,000
targeted ransomware service with a valid

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
partnership

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
so um kind of a change in pace and

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
change of focus how the rest of the

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
conversations have been going

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
as incident responders and threat uh

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,880
analysts we're usually operating on the

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
right side of the boom

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
um so the point of this talk is we

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
really want to dive into

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,479
the valik malware why you should be

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,919
paying attention to it um

44
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
and then chris is going to give an

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
intelligence brief of

46
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
especially the big kind of like

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,360
connections we've made based on real

48
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
world investigations of this

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
um why you should be you know pushing

50
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,159
this to the top of your stack of new

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
things to pay attention

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
to um there's a lot of information in

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
there pay attention to these red boxes

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,600
and red arrows

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
um i didn't want to leave anything out

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,280
that would be great for threat hunters

57
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
and defenders as parts of like

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
potentially pieces of signal you could

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
pick out of the noise

60
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
to detect this type of threat and

61
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,439
brevity is not something i'm known for

62
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,119
so

63
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,639
hopefully the red boxes and red arrows

64
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,640
allows me to kind of move through these

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,040
slides as fast as possible

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
okay so what is valic so if you're not

67
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
familiar with it valik is kind of rel

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,200
relatively new to the commodity malware

69
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
um and definitely within the last six

70
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,399
months we've seen it ramp up

71
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,319
as far as uh amount of infections and

72
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
capability what you really need to know

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,799
for the

74
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
for the for the point of this discussion

75
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,080
is it is a javascript

76
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,760
modular based piece of malware what i

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
mean by modular

78
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
is that not every valid infection is

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
going to be the same

80
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,119
so the capabilities of the malware can

81
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,359
be extended based on plugins that are

82
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,000
downloaded from whatever c2 it is

83
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,200
and that probably sounds familiar and it

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
also should make that immediate

85
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,079
connection because if you think back

86
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,920
2018 2019 when trickbot really hit the

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,000
scene in the ransomware of the service

88
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,399
it also adopted that architecture in

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,599
which depending on what system was

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
infected particular modules would be

91
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
pushed down

92
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
depending on how important that system

93
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,480
was valik has adopted the same sort of

94
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,159
architecture and that goes into theme of

95
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
now valik is going to be a player in the

96
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
same sort of

97
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,280
industry as well um a couple of the

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,879
features there you can see that

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
it's fileless and you'll i'll show

100
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,159
examples of what uh what i mean by that

101
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
but essentially

102
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,239
a few within the last like i would say

103
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,799
six months it has completely dropped

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,040
from

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,640
dropping files to disk for its core

106
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,359
malware instead it keeps a copy of

107
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,760
itself

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
within the registry and it reads that

109
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
registry to invoke itself through a

110
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
scheduled task to persist

111
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,920
uh it has a lot of the common functions

112
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,679
that you'll see through other malware

113
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,238
such as like recon and things like that

114
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
and

115
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
the bottom bullet there is the one that

116
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,000
i really want to uh draw your attention

117
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,480
to

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,480
so within the last few versions it's

119
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
it's included new plugins

120
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,920
that are especially targeting to

121
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,359
enterprise services which leads more

122
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,200
evidence that they're they're now going

123
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
to be you know really part of this

124
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,159
industry

125
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,920
the two functions there are important so

126
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
exchange grabber and client grabber

127
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,399
client grabber is specifically designed

128
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,238
to steal microsoft exchange credentials

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,760
and then exchange grabber does something

130
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,040
pretty neat in that it actually goes

131
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,959
through an exchange mailbox and

132
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
enumerates all the existing

133
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,720
uh email messaging that is going on and

134
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,399
steals copies of them but mostly it's

135
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,760
getting a list of available

136
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,640
uh pieces of or email that exist already

137
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,238
and the reason is because the authors of

138
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,839
the malware do something or the

139
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,119
distributors of the malware do something

140
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,440
very interesting to get it

141
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
you know through traditional security

142
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,000
protections

143
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
so for the most part valik is delivered

144
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
through

145
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
as an attachment shocker but it's

146
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080
password protected zip archives to try

147
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,479
to get through the email gateways

148
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
but then they specifically target reply

149
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,719
chains so

150
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,560
by reply changes they will compromise a

151
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,040
third-party mailbox

152
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,720
enumerate all of the messages in there

153
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
from existing email threads

154
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,080
pick out a target reply to that with the

155
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
payload so

156
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,120
it's you know super sneaky sis like

157
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
double double the chances of someone

158
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
opening it because not only is it

159
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
someone that you trust

160
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
but it's also from a thread that you've

161
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,198
already established

162
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
once they open up the zip archive you'll

163
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,039
see that

164
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,840
you know there's a macro again shocker

165
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,320
downloads a dll that dll is loaded into

166
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,960
the system through reg server 32

167
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,000
the dll doesn't do much after that it

168
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,719
calls basically

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,880
one system called the win xd api call to

170
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,039
load a bit of javascript which is valid

171
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,039
and once valid gets on there there's

172
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,880
only one function that happens by

173
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
default so that is that initial request

174
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,520
function

175
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,039
and through there it it does a few other

176
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
things as far as recon and checking

177
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
itself

178
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,120
in and things like that but the two the

179
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,639
two important things as far as point of

180
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,440
this discussion it creates two get

181
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,120
requests

182
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,240
and the get requests are to download a

183
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
file called project.aspx and a dot aspx

184
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
aspx

185
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039
and those hit the disk as project in a

186
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,359
dot htm

187
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,159
okay so i'm not going to dive too far

188
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
into

189
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
the inner workings of most of valik

190
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,440
actually

191
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,679
if you want to take like a mental note

192
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,680
cyber reason our friends over there did

193
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
a really good write up of every single

194
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,639
function within

195
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
valic you can just google valid malware

196
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,199
i think it's the first result but you

197
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,720
can give that a read and should give it

198
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
a read so you understand the malware and

199
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,479
how it's going to work

200
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
okay so now that we understand what

201
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,400
valic is how machine

202
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
get infected with valik i want to walk

203
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,359
through a case study based on

204
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
investigations that we have done

205
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,960
associated with this malware in

206
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,039
particular with the soda nakibi

207
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,318
ransomware and again stick around for

208
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,840
the end because chris is going to tell

209
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,759
you why you need to specifically pay

210
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,960
attention to this partnership

211
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
okay so stage one and as you're going to

212
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,719
notice in the top left here these

213
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
these are going to walk we walk us

214
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
through five different stages

215
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
and i broke these up by stages every

216
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,479
time that there is a

217
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,758
um a pivot in tools or techniques is

218
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,800
going to be a new stage

219
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,479
and that's going to be important to

220
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,080
remember keep that in the back your mind

221
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,800
as you see this evolve

222
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
think about why would techniques or

223
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
tools change

224
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
okay so here's our evidence on this

225
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,319
machine that

226
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,159
that got infected by valik in the middle

227
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
there you'll see that we have an email

228
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,319
there that has here's the password to my

229
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,479
password protected zip archive with our

230
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,720
our malware this is an existing chain

231
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
from a credit application that happened

232
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
four or five months ago within there

233
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,240
there's our macro there's a lot of

234
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,919
obfuscated code but that doesn't really

235
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,319
do much other than download and

236
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,400
invoke that that uh reg server 32

237
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,400
command to load the dll

238
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,239
from a disk digital forensics point of

239
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,719
view we can see these files hit the disk

240
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,440
in the user profile so project 1.8

241
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,880
htm and a dot hdm actually you can see

242
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,800
project two happens there too because

243
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
this particular user opened up the zip

244
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
archive six times because she couldn't

245
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
get it to work

246
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,840
um once that happens and those downloads

247
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,520
those files so those

248
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,318
are actually gonna be our next pivot

249
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
into stage two because project.aspx is

250
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,440
actually an encoded and encrypted file

251
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,800
that is a patch for a new version of

252
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,160
valik so when it checked into this

253
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
particular c2

254
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
it said okay you're more than just an

255
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,199
initial

256
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
infection we're gonna actually push

257
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,440
stage two down

258
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,280
and what stage two does is project.aspx

259
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,160
is a patch a new version we can see on

260
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
the right

261
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,759
that uh project.aspx in the in the

262
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,000
default call has now been replaced with

263
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,919
bounce.aspx

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
and every time that this checks into the

265
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,560
c2 servers

266
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,560
we're going to see disk artifacts of

267
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
bounce the key well that's a random

268
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,400
number that's generated every time it

269
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,440
does a request.htm and each one of those

270
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,599
are encoded encrypted files a dot aspx

271
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,280
is used for like i mentioned before

272
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,599
plug-ins so that is hits the disk as

273
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,478
pluginhost.exe

274
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
and can be used to execute and modify

275
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,320
plug-ins as they're pushed down if

276
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,240
they're pushed down

277
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,680
okay so stage two so let's look at this

278
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
new version of valic

279
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
it does again it does a whole bunch of

280
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
other things it adds like you know

281
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
multiple different functions and they're

282
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
not really important for the for the

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,240
purpose of this discussion you could

284
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,320
read about them

285
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,080
on the interwebs but we can see that

286
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
initial task has been replaced with

287
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
parse task and this is the only function

288
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
that executes by default

289
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
and within there there's three main

290
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,200
functions that are going to be used for

291
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,839
the operation of this malware we see

292
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
create exec job create ole exec job and

293
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
launch plugin

294
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,439
if you can remember all those bounce

295
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
html files that we saw as disc artifacts

296
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
each one of those is encoded the val the

297
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,719
valid malware can decrypt that and

298
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
decode it

299
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,800
and it's looking for these strings so it

300
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
so this is how it knows what function

301
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,880
it's supposed to be calling so if it

302
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
sees

303
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,519
dash das task in the body of this file

304
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,599
it's going to create it's going to call

305
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,279
the create exact job with the task name

306
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
the task name being that key

307
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,360
associated with those bounce bounce

308
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,880
files that goes after that so let's take

309
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
a look over here on the left and we can

310
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
see

311
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
okay when this particular function is

312
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
called i'm going to create a scheduled

313
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
task named perf watson

314
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,319
underscore whatever that key number is

315
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,920
or

316
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
whatever string and then i'm going to

317
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,160
use wimmick to execute the contents of

318
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,800
whatever is in that bounce file

319
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,519
um as an alternate data stream to

320
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,760
audiosampler.db so that's

321
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
you know you can do that as a command

322
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,640
line parameter if you'd like

323
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,319
but it's an evasion technique so that it

324
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,319
doesn't get whacked by antivirus or

325
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
something like that so

326
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,000
if we pivot back onto that machine and

327
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
see what happens next

328
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
we can infer that that's exactly what

329
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
happened looking at the artifacts on the

330
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
machine

331
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,319
we can see that a new scheduled task was

332
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,560
created we can see that it's using

333
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,200
wemic which is executing this 7b4ee

334
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,800
051 which corresponds back to that bound

335
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,880
to a bounce.htm

336
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
file as an alternate data stream to that

337
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,560
file we're able to recover that file

338
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,880
from slackspace and what

339
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,479
we found out is that is an installer for

340
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,360
the net support manager piece of

341
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,399
software

342
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
uh if you're not familiar with

343
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,200
netsupport manager it is designed

344
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,160
for it support help so it's like a

345
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,079
remote

346
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
you know help desk tool that has you

347
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,199
know commonly been used for nefarious

348
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,040
purposes and i'll show you exactly

349
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
how what net support looks like and what

350
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
it does on the next slide

351
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,079
but now we have a new set of c2

352
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,839
so in the fir in stage one and stage two

353
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,319
we have the c2 block configured in the

354
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
valid

355
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
payload and now we're moving here on the

356
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
right hand side you'll see this right

357
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
arrow from client32.ini and essentially

358
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,680
this

359
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
calls back to the nut support manager

360
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
server

361
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,360
um and they did a simple persistence

362
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,800
here by tucking

363
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,560
client32.exe into a link into a startup

364
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,959
program

365
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,319
okay so now we got two we have two

366
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
pieces of access into this

367
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,519
machine and two sets of c2 okay so

368
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,279
we're still in stage two here and i just

369
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,720
want to show you a little bit uh during

370
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,839
our testing whenever we find these

371
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
artifacts

372
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,399
you know like i said we're on the right

373
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,920
side of the boom so we're obviously

374
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,800
having to collect more data

375
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,399
to put the story together um exactly

376
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
what happened

377
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
in our testing here if we load up

378
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
netsupport manager with our little in

379
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,040
our lab here

380
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
you can see netsupport manager has all

381
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,319
kinds of fancy tools that would be great

382
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
for an attacker to use i can

383
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,639
transfer files i have interactive

384
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,519
powershell access i can record

385
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,639
audio whatever i'd like to do um in

386
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
particular

387
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,040
if i click on this remote command prompt

388
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,439
button here it essentially pops a shell

389
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,519
for me

390
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
like this looks like a windows terminal

391
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,360
and in our testing we

392
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,319
run this command so powershell.exe dash

393
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,639
command who am i

394
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,320
i get my results okay so we've tested

395
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
that now let's go look at the available

396
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,880
telemetry on the machine on our test

397
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,639
machine

398
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
if we take your pay your attention down

399
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,040
here to the bottom there we can see

400
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,319
client 32

401
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,839
executed then rem cmd remcmdstub.exe

402
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
executed so that gets dropped

403
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
during the installation of the file and

404
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
that's what sets up

405
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,279
an interactive shell in the machine from

406
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,199
there our standard process execution

407
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
chain all the way to who am i

408
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
so now that we know that whenever

409
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,239
interactive machine on

410
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
interactive access to this machine is

411
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
established we can

412
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,199
we have a data point to say oh this is

413
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
exactly kind of what happened

414
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
and if we pivot back into the artifacts

415
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
of the machine looking at historical

416
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,399
program execution

417
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,760
if we look at shim cache we can see

418
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,560
exactly this is

419
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,800
exactly what happened so we see

420
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,680
client32.exe

421
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,760
uh 32xqs checks in with the server and

422
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,160
then remcmd sub execute so

423
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,560
boom we know interactive access and now

424
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,319
we have our terminal from there we can

425
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,599
see that there's probably some

426
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
recony uh information or tasks that are

427
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
going on by whoever is controlling on

428
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,839
the other side

429
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,760
and then we see another interesting

430
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
process execution chain

431
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,600
so historically this was mostly done

432
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,160
with ms build

433
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,680
but if you see csc.exe and cbtres.exe

434
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,000
combined or sandwiched in between

435
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,239
powershell that's a process execution

436
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
chain that may be associated with a

437
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,079
c-sharp loader

438
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
so what you can do with with these tools

439
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
is you can

440
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,160
you know basically pull down ross t

441
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,560
sharp code

442
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,240
compile it on the fly and pop a shell on

443
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,000
a machine without writing anything to

444
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,839
disk it's a really slick way

445
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
to do something completely fileless to

446
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,000
avoid detection

447
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,439
on a machine when i saw this initially i

448
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,399
was like well this is interesting right

449
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
because we're always waiting for

450
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,040
powershell to like

451
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
oh powershell has entered the game like

452
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
we're always waiting for it to happen

453
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,399
because it's so ubiquitous now

454
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,639
but it's also they already have

455
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,639
powershell remote access on this machine

456
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,360
through netsupport manager

457
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,480
so this is a pivot to now are we going

458
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
to use powershell

459
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
and if we go back to the machine that

460
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,239
we're analyzing here

461
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,920
we can say that's exactly what happened

462
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,079
powershell is now going to be

463
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,680
what's going on uh artifacts on the

464
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,839
machine that we can tie back to

465
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,800
to put this all together we can see for

466
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
the first time

467
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,399
ever on the history of the event logs on

468
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,079
this machine we have a powershell

469
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,120
remoting session established and that

470
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,719
can be determined by

471
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,639
the host name and the powershell windows

472
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
event logs of server remote host

473
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,639
additionally with windows remote

474
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,638
management service being configured and

475
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,040
listening to anything

476
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,399
additionally from a digital forensic

477
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,240
point of view if you guys remember back

478
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079
from your forensics training

479
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
these registry keys were set so these

480
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
tracing things

481
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
these tracing things registry keys

482
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,599
whenever they're set

483
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,479
these get written to the first time a

484
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,000
binary

485
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
download something from a network

486
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,160
location and these

487
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
time stamps on these three artifacts all

488
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,079
correlate to the same time

489
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
so we we know that powershell remoting

490
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
was being used we know that they

491
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,760
likely enabled power windows remote

492
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,359
management to enable powershell remoting

493
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,319
and then powershell downloaded something

494
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
for the first time

495
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
ever when this happens so that's weird

496
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,839
and so

497
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,920
what okay so powershell is definitely

498
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,680
used and then we pivot again

499
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,199
because the next thing that happens on

500
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,479
this machine in the middle of your

501
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,639
screen there you'll see that there's an

502
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,120
80 recon report file that's written to

503
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,680
disk

504
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
under the domain administrator profile

505
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,680
so two

506
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,279
interesting points there one they've

507
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,079
leveled up to domain admin

508
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,680
so some sometime whenever they went to

509
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
interact to powershell access

510
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,959
they were able to level up their creds

511
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
the second thing

512
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,319
is they are interested to see what else

513
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,079
is operating in this environment if

514
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,720
you're not familiar with adrecon

515
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,160
it's a very awesome tool that i can't

516
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,800
remember the author's name but it's on

517
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
github

518
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,920
whoever your name is great job if you

519
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,758
run that

520
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,399
uh it's just a powershell script it'll

521
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,040
create a very easily navigateable excel

522
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,959
spreadsheet

523
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,040
of all the active directory information

524
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,800
within a domain so all the users all the

525
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
computers all the ou's all the group

526
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,079
policy objects

527
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,000
all the trust everything like that will

528
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,599
be nice in an orderly thing that you can

529
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,240
click through with tabs and shortcuts

530
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,120
it's an excellent tool additionally to

531
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,160
that

532
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
another point of detection here is

533
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
you know this has got low signal to

534
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,040
noise ratio for threat hunters or

535
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,560
detection out there but if you see a

536
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,079
scheduled task or services that's

537
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
referencing something running out of

538
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,638
system maps

539
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,160
that's probably something you want to

540
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
pay attention to so we're going to dive

541
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
into that

542
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
as well a little bit following the

543
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,000
timeline of events we can see the

544
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
powershell is still going to be used

545
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
because

546
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,880
finally they've been on this machine for

547
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,240
days now they finally do their first bit

548
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,720
of uh interactive lateral movement and

549
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,959
it's interesting because

550
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,880
they they chose it was after they got

551
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,000
that 80 recon report they chose a

552
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,600
specific target

553
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,959
and i want to keep that in mind as we go

554
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
through this uh go through the rest of

555
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,000
these slides

556
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,839
um we can see in the bottom right hand

557
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
corner there there's our klingon blob of

558
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,240
powershell when we decode that

559
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,599
it looks like a cobalt strike smb beacon

560
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,959
it could be a few other things but when

561
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,678
you get that name pipe

562
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,240
status underscore and then uh identifier

563
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
name

564
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,599
that's likely going to be cobalt strike

565
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
smb beacons if you're not familiar with

566
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,839
that

567
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,760
it's a great tool that essentially

568
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,520
allows you to proxy command and control

569
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,599
traffic through another machine

570
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,839
so you don't have to pop two beacons you

571
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,879
can just execute commands through smb to

572
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,320
another

573
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,080
so powershell seems to be the way to go

574
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,559
okay that seems to be the way that's

575
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,159
going to happen

576
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,678
we like i said before we want to take a

577
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
look at this scheduled task

578
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,960
uh because it was suspicious based on

579
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,120
where it was you know

580
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,000
located on the machine we take a look at

581
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,879
that and it's actually

582
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
a powershell script um which is probably

583
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
you know

584
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,760
not often we see actual scripts written

585
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
to disk now for persistence

586
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,919
um evil but in this case it makes sense

587
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,799
when we got to dive in to see

588
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,400
exactly how this klingon blob works so

589
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,480
what this thing does is it actually has

590
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,720
a dll that's packed inside this code

591
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
it unpacks that and then injects that

592
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,320
dll

593
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,360
into the powershell.exe process that

594
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
launched the script

595
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,360
and whenever that happens it beacons out

596
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,600
to yet another c2 address

597
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,479
and opens up multiple name pipes looking

598
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,959
for more

599
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,720
uh commands so that's interesting

600
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,799
because if you're keeping track at home

601
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,240
this is our third back door and our

602
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,639
third set of c2

603
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,799
and now we've moved to our third set of

604
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,559
tools and our third set of tactics

605
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,480
so at this point things starting to get

606
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,879
really interesting because now this

607
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,200
potentially an indication of sold access

608
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,840
once valic got access to an enterprise

609
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,440
machine

610
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,520
was it given to someone else and then

611
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,960
given to someone else because it was

612
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,600
you know interesting to to maybe someone

613
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
could

614
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,280
you know squeeze some shekels out of

615
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,440
this out of this uh computer i'm not

616
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,240
sure

617
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,679
okay but then we go to stage four and we

618
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
have pivoted again

619
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,200
and this is again another interesting

620
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
data point

621
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
the first thing that we have on the

622
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
timeline of this new machine so like i

623
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
said they targeted one particular

624
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,480
machine

625
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,559
to to do lateral movement to and

626
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,559
i'm going to explain why we think we did

627
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,160
they did that in a couple seconds here

628
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,639
so the first thing that happens here

629
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,280
is that plink gets dropped on the box

630
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
actually

631
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,840
let me sidebar this for a little bit

632
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
nothing

633
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,959
has devised our team more

634
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
but there's been no diversive subject

635
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,600
more than whether or not this tool

636
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,360
is named plink or p-link so if you

637
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,120
follow up with us in the slack channel

638
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
let me know if you're team plank or team

639
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
p-link

640
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
because i would love to tell my boss

641
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,160
that he is wrong

642
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,440
um so so this is something that we kind

643
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,120
of look for is whenever

644
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,200
plink gets dropped into random

645
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,959
directories on a machine because

646
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
uh if you're not familiar with it that

647
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,440
is basically the command line

648
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,360
interpreter for putty

649
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,039
so it does ssh and does a bunch of other

650
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,719
things one of the interesting things

651
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,240
that attackers use it for

652
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,240
is you can set up some local port

653
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,600
forwarding and you can actually tunnel

654
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,919
rdp traffic over

655
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,639
ssh or whatever port you really want to

656
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,280
do

657
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,559
and a signal for that in the middle

658
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,918
right underneath plink there you see

659
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,158
those two red boxes

660
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,880
that's an event 4624 and we see that

661
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
it's a log on type 10 so terminal server

662
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,000
access and then the source network

663
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
address is 127.0.0.1 you may also see

664
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,520
this a local host

665
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,039
but that that event log in conjunction

666
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,639
with planck is good evidence that

667
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,320
they're tunneling rdp traffic

668
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,000
but they already had powershell access

669
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960
they already had a backdoor access to

670
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,159
this machine

671
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,919
and why do they need to move into

672
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:43,360
gui based access like moving along in

673
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,360
the timeline of this machine

674
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,880
this probably i don't know if this if

675
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
everyone

676
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,679
when we're doing the analysis of all

677
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,720
these investigations is the most

678
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,360
interesting part of this

679
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,320
infection is because you know living off

680
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,559
the land tools is

681
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,240
nothing new everyone kind of knows that

682
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,720
attackers use powershell and whimic and

683
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,200
run dll and and that's kind of like

684
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,840
more or less common knowledge however

685
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,159
it's

686
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,879
way more rare that attackers use living

687
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,840
off the

688
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,880
land for recon tools and so remember how

689
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,639
i said it was interesting that they

690
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,640
picked one machine so this machine was

691
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,799
named in such a way that you could

692
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
infer that it was used to manage or

693
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,280
manage an esxi environment

694
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,280
so they moved to this machine and then

695
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,480
they immediately go into vsphere and

696
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,320
start enumerating all the

697
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,520
all the virtual machines and all

698
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,039
connecting to the disks

699
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,879
connecting to the raw disk through the

700
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,559
api they start

701
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,360
going through nagios and they go through

702
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,520
dela open manage now unless you've done

703
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,639
some level of system administration and

704
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
you have some it

705
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,679
skills to flex like you're not even

706
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,320
going to know that nagios what it can

707
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,000
give you

708
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,918
and what they were doing with nagios is

709
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
they could gen then they could do recon

710
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,840
on networks that were outside of that

711
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,200
vlan or outside of the active directory

712
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,678
environment that they got their report

713
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
from

714
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
and they did that through the dell open

715
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,120
manage system too and they did this for

716
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,320
days and days and days and they

717
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,000
yeah smb scans and they were just

718
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,600
enumerating everything they possibly

719
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,840
could and then

720
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,600
in the bottom right hand corner we get

721
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
something a new data point and this is

722
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,039
one of the good things about having

723
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,039
you know when we respond to incidents

724
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,440
there's always an intel

725
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,240
uh analyst that's assigned to our irs

726
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,159
and

727
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
when i was talking to chris and he's

728
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,440
like you know

729
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,200
threat actors have been leveraging you

730
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,919
know a lot of cloud tools and mega

731
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,880
has been particularly associated with

732
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,400
data theft

733
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,080
and in the bottom right hand corner

734
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
that's a little clip from the rdp cache

735
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,918
you were able to recover

736
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,678
so the mega sync tool was installed on

737
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,080
this machine and doing some research the

738
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,679
mega sync just allows you to sync data

739
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,520
from a machine so if i'm connecting to

740
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,080
virtual machines and if i'm connecting

741
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,679
through nagios and have snmp access to

742
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,158
things or if i have smbx

743
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,960
i can just drag and drop stuff over to

744
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,360
this folder

745
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
and sync it up to mega dot nz and

746
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,280
looking in the firefox

747
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,799
uh history of this machine there was you

748
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,158
know connections to mega dot

749
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,360
nz so at this point we have now evolved

750
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,559
into data theft

751
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,678
so we had it we had commodity we pivoted

752
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,600
into powershell

753
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,720
now we're doing heavy recon through a

754
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,240
bunch of different

755
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
system administration tools and now

756
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,720
we're doing data theft

757
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,679
okay and then suddenly it stops like the

758
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,799
timeline

759
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,640
i can remember the guy talking to me

760
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
he's like it's pages and pages and pages

761
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
of this

762
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,400
and then it just stops and it stops

763
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
immediately whenever they stage the

764
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
ransomware on the domain controller on

765
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
the machine

766
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,520
and then again they start to flex their

767
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,280
it skills so on the top screen cap there

768
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,120
you can see that the

769
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,080
group policy modules for powershell were

770
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,918
loaded and what they knew to do

771
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,760
is they created a new group policy

772
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,720
object they also knew to link it at the

773
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,640
root of the domain

774
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
and mark it as enforced so that they

775
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,000
could bypass

776
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,678
any sort of inheritance problems and

777
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
what this group policy object did was

778
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
disable windows windows defender

779
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,120
disable the firewall and enable windows

780
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,320
remote manage to

781
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,239
listen for connections from anything

782
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,080
then they loaded crack map exec on the

783
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,000
machine so if you're not familiar you

784
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
can google that one too crack map exec

785
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
is a post exploitation tool and one of

786
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
the great features of it is you can pat

787
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,679
you can pipe a list of host names

788
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,120
or networks over to that binary and

789
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,080
create a scheduled task as long as you

790
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,678
have credentials

791
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,279
i thought this was very interesting

792
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,640
because they did have domain admin

793
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,840
rights they showed that they knew how to

794
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,080
use group policy

795
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:26,399
this was a windows 2008 r2 uh domain

796
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,600
and i think this is just me speculating

797
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
here but i think that they knew that

798
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,120
group policy preferences in a 2008

799
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,678
functional level

800
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,279
are unreliable at best and so they

801
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,400
decided to pivot to something else

802
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
because they wanted to make sure that

803
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
they would have the effect

804
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
um so they did this they pushed us out

805
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,720
to all these machines and we were able

806
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,480
to recover some of that and essentially

807
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
they did a gp update force

808
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
to make sure it's going to pull down

809
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,400
that group policy so nothing will get in

810
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,879
the way

811
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,919
because as you can expect boom goes

812
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
dynamite

813
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,480
this is crack map exact passing all of

814
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,600
these networks so

815
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,679
if you can see all these different

816
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,158
networks all these slash 24s

817
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,799
this these networks weren't weren't of

818
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,600
the direct

819
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
access so of the purview of that machine

820
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
uh

821
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,120
unless you would have done the

822
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
reconnaissance through nadia so if

823
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,760
you're just going based on the active

824
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
directory available

825
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
subnets like you wouldn't have known

826
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,880
that some of these ip ranges are out

827
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,039
there so it really showed that they

828
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
they knew what they were doing um and we

829
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,679
were able to recover this batch file

830
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,440
essentially says you know

831
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,279
piping in there they change the domain

832
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,520
admin profile tell it

833
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,320
run this ransomware as soon as you can

834
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,879
and then everything gets boned

835
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
okay again i know i went really fast

836
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
here

837
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,000
uh but you know there's only so much

838
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,158
time and and i'm a talker but

839
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,600
so if you are a responder or a threat

840
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,640
hunter here's my here's my bit of

841
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,480
soapbox here

842
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,240
i cannot recommend doing something like

843
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,640
this enough so

844
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,559
whenever you have evidence that you've

845
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
either gotten through an investigation

846
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,559
or you're threat hunting

847
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,399
is that leverage you know a graphic tool

848
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,879
like this to build out each one of the

849
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,960
points

850
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,640
in which the attacker has an activity in

851
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,240
each one of the stages in which a tool

852
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
and the technique has changed

853
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,520
because if we go through this each one

854
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,600
of these boxes

855
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,360
is a potential for detection before we

856
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,639
get to the right hand side of the boom

857
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,719
in stage five and

858
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
and not only do we have like all kinds

859
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,159
of you know compromised machines but now

860
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,159
everything's encrypted as well

861
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
so everything that that's going on in

862
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,039
here we really need to

863
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,399
assess this against our available

864
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
telemetry and say

865
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
okay we have all these data points where

866
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,480
are we missing data from

867
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,480
and let me tie this back to a tool set

868
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,799
and if i don't have that telemetry

869
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,799
i need to mark that as a gap and then

870
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,720
develop a threat hunting process around

871
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,158
that so that's my bit of soapbox

872
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,520
and uh i'm not going to take any

873
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,960
questions now for this because i want to

874
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,158
give chris enough time

875
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,159
to talk through his piece

876
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,120
thank you thank you for that excellent

877
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,559
and thorough analysis

878
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,239
so up to this point um john has given us

879
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,480
deep technical insight

880
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,480
into a sodium kibi attack

881
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,678
uh i need control there we go

882
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,159
all right but now what i like to do is

883
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
shift gears and zoom out a little bit

884
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,440
and provide some

885
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
threat intelligence that will complement

886
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,080
and

887
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,960
complete our our picture of

888
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,240
this sodium okabe criminal business

889
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,279
during the next few slides

890
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:30,960
i'll be i'll present information to

891
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,960
that aims to answer questions about

892
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,080
there we go to answer questions about

893
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,080
for example our attribution assessment

894
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,080
and other more general intelligence

895
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,639
questions like

896
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,918
what are the victims what are the victim

897
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,640
types

898
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
how lucrative or not is this criminal

899
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,600
enterprise

900
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,158
and some other other interesting topics

901
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,158
like

902
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,279
you know the strategies they take these

903
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,720
attackers take

904
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,279
to force their their victims

905
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
to pay a ransom after all you know

906
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,200
success

907
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,760
of this kind of activity is really you

908
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,320
know

909
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,360
extracting the best possible ransom

910
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,520
payment from its victims

911
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,000
so as john stated during the latter

912
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,480
stages stages four and five we began to

913
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,360
observe more sophisticated attacker

914
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
activity

915
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,879
to include the installation and use of

916
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,799
malware

917
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,039
that we were able to analyze and

918
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,799
identify as a 64-bit

919
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,799
variant of the carbon back door

920
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,880
after more detailed analysis of its

921
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,880
network activity

922
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,840
next slide

923
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,200
after a more detailed analysis of his c2

924
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,959
activity and other factors

925
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
we arrived at the assessment that this

926
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,120
attack the saudi nokia attack was

927
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
likely attributable to the threat group

928
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,320
that we identify

929
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,080
as itg 14. now to talk about

930
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,439
how we arrive at that assessment let me

931
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,080
just briefly mention

932
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,240
a colleague of mine oola vladson he is

933
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,799
the subject matter expert for itg14

934
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,440
and he observed in december 2019 a

935
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,440
fortinet

936
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,200
open source intelligence report in which

937
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,760
they in which fortinet

938
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,120
describes its discovery of a new loader

939
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,200
it called bioload

940
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
and believed to be exclusive to fin

941
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,559
seven

942
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,760
and in that report it also details how

943
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,879
that loader loaded

944
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,320
a new 64-bit variant of the carbon act

945
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,960
back door

946
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,080
now fast forward to may 2020 our sodium

947
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
kibi attack

948
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
um the carbon backdoor sample that we

949
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,879
recovered and analyzed

950
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,879
used a c2ip address that c2ip address

951
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
when later we soon found out was also

952
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,640
used by another

953
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,440
unique piece of malware that oola

954
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,000
detected using his yara's signature

955
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,679
um he detected this sample downloaded it

956
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,720
and confirmed that it was also

957
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,840
in fact a 64-bit carbon

958
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,720
back door so for these reasons and

959
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,000
others

960
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,159
we assess that this attack was conducted

961
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,799
by the sodium nuclei affiliate that we

962
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,399
identify

963
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:37,840
as itg 14 also known as fin7

964
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:37,840
next slide

965
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,840
so from this may 2020 attack really was

966
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,880
the catalyst

967
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,520
for a more proactive detailed and

968
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,480
focused

969
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,799
threat intelligence monitoring effort to

970
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,799
and

971
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,840
the goal was to really understand the

972
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,240
totality

973
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,000
of this sodium kibby activity and

974
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,159
business

975
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,360
and we use multiple different sources

976
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,600
for this in

977
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,519
intensified monitoring effort to include

978
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,000
our own internal intelligence derived

979
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,519
from other sodium nakibi investigations

980
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,519
as well as information derived from

981
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,840
deep and dark web criminal mono

982
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,159
communications monitoring

983
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,760
monitoring sony kitty's own hidden

984
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,200
service website called the

985
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,158
the happy blog and other other various

986
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,080
sources

987
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,919
and so the outcome of this really kind

988
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,279
of helped us gain a

989
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,919
better better insight into this activity

990
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,320
and understand for example victimology

991
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,399
um

992
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,840
so we assess from this monitoring effort

993
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,879
we assess that there are approximately

994
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,120
100

995
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
well it's changed now since i the

996
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,320
pre-proactive

997
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,679
group threat group here so it's it's now

998
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,439
up to 140

999
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,360
to 145 victim organizations

1000
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,640
that fall into one of 21 different

1001
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,080
countries

1002
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,440
and one of 27 different industries

1003
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,000
of those 140 145 victims

1004
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,120
most by far and large belong to the

1005
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,799
united states

1006
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,918
followed by a distant second and third

1007
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,918
united kingdom in australia

1008
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,039
of the 130 540 victims most fall into

1009
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,600
a high percentage fall into one of three

1010
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,559
industries wholesale professional

1011
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:29,840
services

1012
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:29,840
and manufacturing next slide

1013
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,720
in addition to identify you know

1014
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,760
estimating victim count

1015
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,159
and other factors for victimology we

1016
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,559
also were able to understand more about

1017
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,840
the ransom amounts and this is important

1018
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,760
because

1019
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,760
if we can find out more detail about

1020
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,320
ransom amounts and other metadata around

1021
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,320
that

1022
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,360
we can start to understand whether this

1023
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
is lucrative

1024
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,000
activity or not by the attacker and

1025
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,960
knowing that can help us

1026
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,519
assess you know estimate you know how if

1027
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,120
this will

1028
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,440
can if this activity is likely to

1029
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,158
continue or not in the foreseeable

1030
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,320
future

1031
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,519
and we found that this is a potentially

1032
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,720
very lucrative

1033
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,799
for these attackers for example

1034
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,200
when we began this monitoring effort we

1035
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,200
found we had very specific amounts

1036
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,399
ransom amounts

1037
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,960
for very specific victim organizations

1038
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,158
but what perplexed us was that these

1039
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,480
ransom amounts

1040
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
varied a lot from organization

1041
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,679
organization

1042
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,159
and at first it wasn't clear why but

1043
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,880
then we found evidence that suggests

1044
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,720
these attackers are using annual revenue

1045
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,960
as at least one factor for setting

1046
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,960
ransom amounts for victims

1047
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,240
and so with this new evidence we

1048
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,720
enumerated all the

1049
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,240
the known victims and estimated victims

1050
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,320
and other metadata around those victim

1051
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,720
organizations like annual revenue

1052
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,039
and then we mapped those specific those

1053
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,440
known specific ransom amounts

1054
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,960
to the annual revenue to determine what

1055
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,080
percentage

1056
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,480
of of that ransom amount was

1057
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
you know compared to the um the annual

1058
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,279
revenue

1059
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,039
and so we were able to derive an

1060
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,199
estimated ransom amount

1061
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,079
range as a percentage of total annual

1062
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,439
revenue

1063
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,200
and you can see the range on the right

1064
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,800
hand side is between 0.75 percent

1065
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,158
and 9.1 percent but this still is is a

1066
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,639
little bit shy of helping us

1067
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,879
understand whether how lucrative or not

1068
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,320
this activity is

1069
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,239
and and so we were able to identify more

1070
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
more evidence that allowed us to

1071
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,118
estimate and know

1072
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,919
which victims have paid and not paid

1073
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,320
have likely paid and not paid and if we

1074
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:43,679
zoom in on just one small subset of

1075
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,639
those 140 to 145 victim organizations

1076
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,159
we realize that 10 up that 14 of those

1077
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,480
victim organizations

1078
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,679
have annual revenues exceeding 1 billion

1079
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,719
dollars

1080
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,839
and of those 14 we estimate 10

1081
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:59,520
have likely paid the ransom

1082
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,599
and so what that term what that means in

1083
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
terms of dollar amounts is that

1084
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,440
we estimate that the attacker had the

1085
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,079
attackers have made

1086
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,520
approximately 77 million dollars and

1087
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,119
that's at the conservative

1088
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,119
low range estimate

1089
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,160
but all hope is not lost um on the

1090
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,879
left-hand side there we've

1091
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,160
outlined a general high-level attacker

1092
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,720
timeline

1093
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,440
and why is this important because this a

1094
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,680
timeline

1095
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,800
indicates that in the worst case

1096
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,640
scenario if

1097
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,400
an organization becomes a victim to

1098
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,560
these types of attacks

1099
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
there's still a time period a brief time

1100
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,359
period there's still hope

1101
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,119
that given the right preparation that an

1102
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,160
organization can

1103
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,640
potentially greatly mitigate the overall

1104
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,480
impact of these kinds of attacks

1105
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,160
and as you see on the left-hand side we

1106
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,359
found in one example

1107
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,560
dwell time was approximately 11 days and

1108
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,119
of those 11 days

1109
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,200
nine days were spent conducting recon

1110
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,240
and other various activity

1111
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,960
and in another example by the attacker's

1112
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,839
own

1113
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,800
admission they've spent up to five days

1114
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,920
stealing data

1115
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,560
just stealing data um that that totaled

1116
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,200
around a terabyte of data

1117
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,200
next slide

1118
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,720
so in the worst unfortunate scenario

1119
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,640
worst case unfortunate scenario that an

1120
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,040
organization becomes a victim

1121
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,680
of these types of attacks what can they

1122
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,800
expect

1123
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,560
next once the data has been stolen

1124
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
once the data is encrypted and they have

1125
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,759
the ransom note what's next

1126
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,759
and what we found through our

1127
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,440
observations is that the attackers

1128
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,640
have a very a very progressive

1129
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,720
tactic of applying and reapplying

1130
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,920
pressure on the victim organization to

1131
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,879
pay

1132
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,040
and that escalation of pressure approach

1133
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,560
looks a little bit like this

1134
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,359
first they get the ransom note with

1135
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,440
instructions to contact the threat

1136
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,720
and when they do they go to this hidden

1137
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,119
service website

1138
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,078
and get more instructions in more detail

1139
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,320
and that detail

1140
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,520
includes things like the initial ransom

1141
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,079
amount and then

1142
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,920
the initial seven day deadline and then

1143
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,680
in those instructions they also are told

1144
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,960
if they don't pay the ransom within the

1145
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,520
first seven days

1146
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,200
the ransom will double so that's kind of

1147
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,359
the initial

1148
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,720
hint of escalation that the attacker

1149
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,640
plans to apply

1150
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,839
escalation pressure the attacker intends

1151
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,560
to apply on the victim organization

1152
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,759
if the seven day deadline expires and

1153
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,720
they haven't paid

1154
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,400
then the ransom doubles again more

1155
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,040
pressure on the victim

1156
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,599
victim organization still not compliant

1157
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
then

1158
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,280
the nest the next step of escalation

1159
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,800
occurs the victim's name is listed on

1160
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
the attacker hidden

1161
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
website called the happy blog along with

1162
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,320
a

1163
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
short friendly uh comment from the

1164
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,880
attacker

1165
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,320
something along the lines of we have

1166
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,839
compromised your network

1167
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,599
we suggest you contact us soon

1168
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,599
if the victim is still not compliant

1169
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,680
after a short period of time

1170
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,440
then you start to see more actions on

1171
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
the part more aggressive actions on the

1172
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,800
part of the attacker

1173
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,959
and that is the attacker will begin to

1174
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,839
if it hasn't already done so

1175
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,119
sho list upload screenshots of data the

1176
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,279
attacker has allegedly stolen

1177
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,200
along with other more specific and

1178
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,119
aggressive comments

1179
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,319
for example we've seen more aggressive

1180
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,480
comments like

1181
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,599
in three days and each day after if you

1182
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,160
do not pay

1183
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,960
we will begin to leak your data and sure

1184
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,759
enough

1185
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,560
if you watch it two things can happen

1186
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
either

1187
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,078
nothing else happens and the victim is

1188
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,320
completely removed

1189
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,920
all mentions of the victim is completely

1190
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,720
removed from the blog

1191
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,520
or you start to see data leads and those

1192
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,560
data leaks

1193
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,800
started out with those specific threats

1194
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,640
of releasing data where it has you know

1195
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,680
data leak one data lead to data leak

1196
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,000
three

1197
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,118
um and then after the third day the the

1198
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,119
deadline passes

1199
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,680
those those placeholders become hot

1200
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,440
links to the data the attacker allegedly

1201
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
stole

1202
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,359
and then if things progress really bad

1203
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,040
it moves to the auction portion of the

1204
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,119
website

1205
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,400
and from there it looks very similar to

1206
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,480
the happy blog

1207
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,079
where the victim's name is listed and a

1208
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,320
short description of the data

1209
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,160
that the attacker has allegedly stolen

1210
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,240
and is now listing for sale

1211
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,240
and from here two scenarios can happen

1212
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,640
either anonymous buyer scenario one

1213
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,399
anomalous buyer purchases the data

1214
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,759
and the auction closes and that

1215
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,520
completes this whole

1216
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,240
attack process in scenario 2 there is no

1217
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,200
buyer

1218
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,040
the deadline expires the deadline for

1219
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,759
the auction expires

1220
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,440
and the attacker will presumably leak

1221
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
all the data it has for that victim

1222
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
organization

1223
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,160
and even recently we've seen one more

1224
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,560
level one more

1225
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,480
element of pressure added to this and

1226
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,119
that is in addition to the final data

1227
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,839
leak

1228
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,640
the attacker now is threatening to send

1229
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,520
the data to

1230
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,240
specific parties that the victim

1231
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,920
organization

1232
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,399
presumably would not want to have the

1233
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,680
data parties like regulators

1234
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,160
competitors and media

1235
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
next slide

1236
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,079
but the threat of releasing data um

1237
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,599
relies on the value of that data the

1238
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,680
potential value that

1239
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,720
that the victim organization has in that

1240
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,160
data

1241
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,319
in terms of how much overall damage and

1242
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,598
impact it can cause negative damage and

1243
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,480
impact it can cause

1244
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,200
on the victim organization and so we set

1245
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,720
out to

1246
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,319
we'll kind of what kind of data is the

1247
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:43,279
attacker releasing

1248
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,200
and this slide lists out that kind of

1249
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,520
data that the attacker is listing

1250
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,000
and so what this really means is that

1251
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,720
you know the attacker is

1252
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,440
is putting out credible threats they

1253
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,000
have

1254
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,520
likely stolen you know very damn

1255
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,480
potentially damaging

1256
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,000
data um data that can damage the the

1257
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,560
victim organization reputa

1258
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,280
in terms of reputation and fines and and

1259
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,759
other

1260
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,880
and other aspects points of cell data

1261
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,520
scada data

1262
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,359
mark confidential data that can uh

1263
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,160
negatively impact a start

1264
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,359
a stock market price or an initial

1265
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,520
public offering

1266
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,960
um very sensitive stuff like

1267
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,960
intellectual property

1268
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,560
and pci phi data um one really kind of

1269
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,599
alarming recent example of this phi pci

1270
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,799
data leak that they've done is uh one

1271
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,359
victim organization

1272
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,359
was was in the health care industry and

1273
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,680
and the attacker released

1274
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,720
um a partial data leak an initial data

1275
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,240
leak that

1276
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,520
included actual baby ultrasound videos

1277
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,959
and pictures

1278
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:50,000
so the attacker has a process some

1279
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,119
process

1280
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,160
a very effective process of of

1281
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,920
bulk exam examining bulk data um

1282
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,598
in a way that they can identify very

1283
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,040
sensitive data

1284
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,800
of potential value for pressuring the

1285
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:17,520
victim organization to pay a ransom

1286
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:19,200
next slide

1287
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,960
and so before i conclude the

1288
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,680
presentation i'd like to just touch on a

1289
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,160
few other

1290
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,319
notable observations and trends for

1291
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,598
example the use and abuse of remote

1292
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,680
access software

1293
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,839
like any desk and net support manager

1294
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,240
and john touched on one of those

1295
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,319
the use and abuse of clouds legitimate

1296
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,879
cloud storage platforms to facilitate

1297
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,880
both

1298
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,400
the infill of attacker tooling and

1299
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,119
malware and also

1300
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
facilitate the theft and exfiltration of

1301
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,800
victim organization

1302
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,079
data cloud storage legitimate cloud

1303
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,240
storage platforms like

1304
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,079
mega and syn space and sync.com and

1305
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,720
privatelab.net

1306
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,560
dropmefiles.com and on files.com

1307
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,200
and we've even identified some other

1308
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,599
interesting criminal partnerships

1309
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,480
um services like bulk translation

1310
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,680
services that support a wide range

1311
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,079
of of uh languages and so we've found

1312
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,078
on the dark web these services being

1313
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,520
offered to

1314
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,480
multiple ransomware as a service

1315
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
syndicates if you will and we believe

1316
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,079
that these services

1317
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,680
are are one way these attackers are

1318
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,640
using to

1319
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,680
bulk review and analyze and find and

1320
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,799
identify

1321
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,359
data that they can use to

1322
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,079
pressure the victim organization to to

1323
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,078
pay a ransom

1324
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,839
next slide

1325
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,440
so in conclusion we've identified at

1326
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,319
least one notorious financially

1327
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,240
motivated

1328
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,560
attacker itg 14 also known as fin 7

1329
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,160
now conducting ransomware attacks and

1330
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,680
why is this important because this

1331
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,399
indicates that

1332
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,440
a sophisticated financial threat that

1333
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,240
was once

1334
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,200
most known for targeting points of sale

1335
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,799
systems

1336
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,879
most well-known for targeting points of

1337
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,680
sale systems is now also

1338
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,280
conducting ransomware attacks and this

1339
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,000
this kind of indicates

1340
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,800
either their their conducting point of

1341
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,359
sales attacks

1342
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,119
as well as ransom attacks or maybe this

1343
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,799
is an indication that

1344
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,240
they could be shifting their focus to a

1345
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,960
more lucrative

1346
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,839
and growing business model the ransom

1347
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,680
attack ransomware as a service

1348
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,078
attack and as don pointed out these

1349
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,680
attacks are fast and they're interactive

1350
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,200
but there's still time and there's still

1351
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,200
hope uh that

1352
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,118
you know given the right preparations um

1353
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,598
using indicators like what john pointed

1354
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,440
out

1355
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,079
and patching vulnerabilities like those

1356
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,440
listed on the right hand side here

1357
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,359
securing and hardening remote access

1358
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,960
points like rdp businesses can take

1359
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,520
these kind of preparations

1360
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,720
and even if they fall victim to these

1361
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,640
kinds of attacks

1362
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,879
the timeline indicates there's still the

1363
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,400
potential to mitigate the overall impact

1364
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,040
of these kinds of attacks

1365
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,680
and you know data is being stolen so

1366
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,000
backups

1367
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,960
aren't enough organizations must get

1368
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,560
good at stopping data data exfiltration

1369
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,680
and one one first step at stopping this

1370
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,720
is identifying which public cloud

1371
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,520
storage platforms

1372
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,200
have business justification and then you

1373
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,040
know

1374
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,480
which the ones that don't just start to

1375
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,520
block those and and that list that i

1376
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,880
provided you

1377
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,720
is a good starting point for for that um

1378
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,800
and then you know these attacks look

1379
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,200
very much like an insider threat attack

1380
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,520
where

1381
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,240
they're using legitimate but compromised

1382
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,280
credentials

1383
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,319
to conduct all sorts of activity from

1384
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,040
initial access

1385
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,160
to internal recon escalation privileges

1386
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,520
etc

1387
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,399
and using legitimate i.t admin software

1388
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,200
to facilitate all this activity so

1389
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,079
getting good

1390
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,640
at behavior analytics is also another

1391
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,520
potential win for victim organizations

1392
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,598
to help prevent and mitigate these types

1393
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,280
of attacks

1394
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,680
at this time that concludes our

1395
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,599
presentation thank you very much for

1396
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,960
giving us the opportunity to be here and

1397
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,480
present this to you and

1398
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,480
to open the floor for questions and

1399
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,240
