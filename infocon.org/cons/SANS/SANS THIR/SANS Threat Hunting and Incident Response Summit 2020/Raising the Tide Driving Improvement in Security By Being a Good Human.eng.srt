1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,320
and with that

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,920
i would like to introduce david bianco

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,840
who's going to be giving our

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,360
second keynote of the summit here um

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,039
david is somebody who i've known for a

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,400
number of years had the great

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
opportunity to work with in a few

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,119
different capacities

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
um he is uh working with with the target

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,000
company

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
which we heard some folks yesterday

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,679
david is also somebody that

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,519
he will probably not like that i say

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,640
this but um i kind of

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,320
have always seen him as kind of the

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,239
the godfather of threat hunting if you

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
will um and that's a

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,360
meant in the absolute highest highest

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
regard

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,120
um it's really cool to have his

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
perspective and expertise as he's going

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,800
to be teaching friends it's 572 next

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
week with the the summit event

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,399
um and when i got to sit in the class

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,718
when david was was uh

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,000
teaching uh one of the trial runs i

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,120
learned a whole lot more about my own

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,760
material which was really kind of

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,718
awesome

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,680
just to hear his perspective on it so um

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
that all said

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,600
this talk is going to be really good

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,799
because it's going to talk about how we

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,919
become better as

35
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,080
a community as an industry and

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
i really want you to just kind of put

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
that email away whatever it might be i

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
know it's early in the morning um just

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,839
really pay attention to this because

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,720
this is going to be something that

41
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
you're going to need

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,880
to hear you're going to need to absorb

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,000
and you're going to really need to think

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,520
a lot about before

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
you can take this out into your to your

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,079
workplace and apply it because

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,679
this is going to be a uh a very

48
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,798
continuous process and i don't want to

49
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,720
steal too much away from

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,320
what david's going to present but um

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,798
that all being said david thank you so

52
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
much for

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
taking your time with us today and

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,240
sharing this and uh i am

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
happy to turn this over to you sir and

56
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,479
uh

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
good luck with the other presentation

58
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,159
well good morning everyone welcome to

59
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,719
day two

60
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,560
uh before i get started i just wanna do

61
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,759
uh i just wanna say thanks to everyone

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
who spoke yesterday

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
and and also to those of you who are

64
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,919
speaking

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
later today the threat hunting summit is

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
like

67
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
it's one of my favorite conferences

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
every year as i i really just

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,000
love learning from other hunters so

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
thanks to all the speakers

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,840
i also want to say thanks to the sand

72
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,920
staff because they do an incredible

73
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
amount of work to make all this possible

74
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,599
so thank you very much

75
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
giving a keynote is well it's a big

76
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,760
honor but it's

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,239
it's more a big responsibility

78
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
i'm supposed to not only wake you up

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,200
first thing in the morning but

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,160
also set a tone for the day

81
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,040
i think the best keynotes are also in

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
some way

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,200
inspirational they look at a problem and

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
they make you want to be part of the

85
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,399
solution

86
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,958
they make you want to do something

87
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,080
better

88
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
to be better

89
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
i spend a fair amount of time trying to

90
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
make security better

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,040
it's something i think about a lot i do

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,720
what i can both at a macro level by

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,200
publishing things like the hunting

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,400
maturity model and the pyramid of pain

95
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,799
and also at the micro level by

96
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
lending encouragement or guidance or

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
advice to people

98
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,958
who are just trying to get better at

99
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
security

100
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,800
maybe even just trying to get their

101
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,879
first job in the field like honestly a

102
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
lot of it is just me trying to be a good

103
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
human

104
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,079
but as it turns out being a good human

105
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
is a great way to make things better for

106
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,159
everyone

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,920
they say a rising tide lifts all boats

108
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
on the surface you might think the

109
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,879
infosec tide is already pretty high

110
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
and there are many more open jobs than

111
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,000
experienced people to fill them so

112
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
it's kind of a candidate's market most

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
people working in the field are paid

114
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,000
pretty well

115
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,120
and every day we get new and interesting

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,439
problems to work on

117
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:00,239
so most of us are never bored at work

118
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
not all is well in the infosec harbor

119
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,640
though

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,879
getting your first job in security is

121
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,119
hard because everyone wants experienced

122
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,560
or senior candidates instead of

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,120
training up entry level job seekers

124
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
we're subject to high levels of stress

125
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,478
and burnout

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,880
perhaps most importantly many of our

127
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,758
industry's lifeblood communications

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
platforms

129
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,400
often feel like cesspools of

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,440
gatekeeping and toxic negativity

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,960
security can't be kind of an unwelcome

132
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,800
or even hostile field for some people

133
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,799
but i'm not here to talk about how we

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,440
should hire more entry-level candidates

135
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,199
though

136
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,440
hit me up in my slack channel later if

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,160
you want to talk more about that

138
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
i'm also not here to talk about stress

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,120
and burnout

140
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
there have been a number of really good

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
articles and presentations

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
and initiatives that address that in the

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,880
last couple of years and do it way

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,960
better than i can

145
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
i am here to talk about how we can

146
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,280
reshape our professional community to

147
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,400
create a more diverse

148
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,840
inclusive space where we can all bring

149
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
our best ideas find help and inspiration

150
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,198
when we need it and then

151
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
encourage professional growth not just

152
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,600
for ourselves

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,160
but for those around us too that

154
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
might sound like a tall order and it is

155
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
but we can do it

156
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,960
the good news is there are three simple

157
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,199
steps that we can start doing today

158
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,560
that i think will raise the tide for

159
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,560
everyone in security

160
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,080
and we do need that tide raised if

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
you're like me you probably depend on

162
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,479
social platforms like twitter to keep up

163
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,599
with current events and security

164
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
i follow a ton of people uh it's how i

165
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
find out about new attack

166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
techniques i need to be able to detect i

167
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,919
read about the results of new research i

168
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,039
just connect with friends and colleagues

169
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,359
in the industry

170
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
i mean it's it's not the sole source of

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
any of my security information

172
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,520
but twitter is usually one of the most

173
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,680
up-to-date sources and

174
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,719
usually also the most convenient to

175
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
access

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
but for something so critical to our

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,919
profession

178
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,720
twitter is kind of a rough neighborhood

179
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,240
this tweet here is just like one example

180
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
of the kind of

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
pernicious gatekeeping that you might

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,159
find cropping up

183
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
in the middle of nearly any thread on

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,039
any platform not just twitter

185
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
the cyber security community does not

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
need people like this he says well read

187
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,600
that tweet closely

188
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
like what he's really saying is i am not

189
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
willing to put up with beginners

190
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
people who studied hard to learn the

191
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
basics of their intended new job and

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
just

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
lack experience

194
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
almost every week i see some kind of

195
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
article saying we're not even

196
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,840
able to supply enough security people to

197
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,560
f to fill our existing positions

198
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,880
and the demand keeps increasing so if

199
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,360
you're discouraging beginners

200
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,039
you're actually making the problem worse

201
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
not better

202
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,360
and by the way if you are a beginner

203
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,120
just let me tell you he is dead wrong i

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,800
know it's harder right now to get

205
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,280
started than it should be

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
but we absolutely do need you

207
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,000
now this was a screenshot retweet by gab

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
smash who has

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,599
previously i stated publicly that she

210
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,400
didn't come into the field via

211
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,319
a technical path but so i i know or at

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
least i hope she's being sarcastic here

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,800
with her shocked face emoji but

214
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,520
imagine what it must be like to be a

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,800
student or a career changer reading that

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,960
original tweet

217
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
like here's someone inside the industry

218
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,560
telling you

219
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,960
not only that you don't belong but that

220
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
you'll

221
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
never belong because he doesn't want you

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
working

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,400
and gaining the experience he says that

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,720
you need in order to work in the first

225
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,719
place

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,960
here's another example of the kind of

227
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,199
junk you can find

228
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,318
every day in our supposedly professional

229
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,000
community

230
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
to me the original tweet here just shows

231
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
that

232
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,080
not only has the person in question

233
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,919
struck

234
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,919
probably an appropriate work-life

235
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,719
balance but has apparently

236
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,719
also been forced to defend it in a

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
fairly blunt manner but

238
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
you know what she's a woman therefore mr

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
wall here

240
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
has apparently decided that because

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,160
she's not at everyone's beck and call 24

242
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,479
hours a day seven days a week

243
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,159
she somehow deserves that unjust pay

244
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,838
disparity that she's probably being

245
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,319
forced to endure

246
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,839
this is unadulterated sexism

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
straightforward and

248
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,880
unapologetic

249
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,040
speaking of unapologetic i

250
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
barely even know what to say about this

251
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,680
one it's a flat

252
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,880
out negation of the need for inclusivity

253
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,359
and security

254
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,360
like i'm just aghast

255
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,120
this last example targeted my friend

256
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,920
jackie who goes by find evil on twitter

257
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,480
for some reason she's been the target of

258
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,680
persistent harassment by the operator of

259
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,760
this twitter account

260
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,479
which by the way named for one of the

261
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
most racist misogynistic groups of

262
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,560
homophobes

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,760
in insecurity i guess

264
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,680
because she's a woman of color who dares

265
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
to be good at hunting bad guys

266
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,279
and she has opinions

267
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,240
here they're publishing a photo of her

268
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,160
home

269
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,160
that's her home they did stop short of

270
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,319
publishing her actual address but

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,160
this is a classic intimidation technique

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,720
and an implicit threat

273
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,719
that they may choose to dox her whenever

274
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
they feel like it in the future

275
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,640
they're basically saying i know where

276
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,240
you sleep i know where your

277
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,839
kids sleep now fortunately jackie

278
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,760
happens to work for the biden harris

279
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,600
campaign so when twitter initially

280
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
refused to take action

281
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
vice.com published a story the headline

282
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
read

283
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,440
twitter is letting people threaten joe

284
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,200
biden's cyber security expert

285
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,200
twitter was eventually shamed into

286
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
shutting down the account so on one hand

287
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,920
that's good

288
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
it's resolved for now on the other hand

289
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,439
though

290
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
it's a shame that it took some major

291
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,000
media attention which is

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
not something most of us can easily get

293
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,880
and don't

294
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,560
don't even get me started about the fact

295
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
that just having your twitter account

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,599
suspended is essentially getting away

297
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,079
with this type of

298
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,720
threatening behavior without any real

299
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,719
consequence

300
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,920
these tweets make me angry

301
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,680
and i'm not trying to pick on twitter

302
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,040
here because i see this behavior

303
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,079
everywhere that we

304
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
as a profession get together even in

305
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:55,120
some

306
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,880
in-person events all this makes me angry

307
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,120
maybe right now you're a little bit

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,800
angry too

309
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,800
let's look at some calming boats

310
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,160
while we're de-stressing let's talk

311
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,800
about what we

312
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,480
can do to fight the types of behaviors

313
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,640
we just saw

314
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
i'll say it up front this is not a

315
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
problem that we can solve with

316
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
technology

317
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,120
i know that as technologists that's

318
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,680
often our first impulse

319
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,240
certainly social media giants like

320
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,040
twitter

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,040
and facebook are investing heavily in

322
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
technological solutions and hoping

323
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,199
they'll work but

324
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,760
despite the fact that the problem is

325
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,760
often

326
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,800
expressed through technology it's not

327
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,439
really a fundamentally

328
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
technological problem it's actually a

329
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,200
human

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,800
problem and therefore we require a human

331
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
solution

332
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
and i say solution but i don't mean that

333
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,160
we can

334
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,760
actually solve the problem entirely and

335
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,800
prevent people from behaving

336
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
reprehensibly

337
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,000
that's impossible but what we can do

338
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,800
what we each can do is take steps to

339
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
actively raise the level of discourse

340
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,000
wherever we gather

341
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,519
in person and online

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,959
and i do mean actively most of us

343
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,839
are really are good people but being a

344
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,399
good person

345
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,200
isn't always obvious to others

346
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
especially

347
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,279
if you're a silent witness to this kind

348
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,880
of heinousness

349
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,040
if you want to create a more inclusive

350
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,439
environment where everyone can

351
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
contribute and feel safe doing so we

352
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,839
have to not just be

353
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,199
good humans but we have to actively be

354
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,279
good humans

355
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,600
we have to look for opportunities to

356
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,959
reach out to others to support them to

357
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
encourage them

358
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,040
to help them so what does being an

359
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,040
actively good human look like well

360
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,439
i can't give you a full answer because

361
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
there's just so many ways you could go

362
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,839
about it

363
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
making a list of them all wouldn't be

364
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,560
that useful anyway

365
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,880
but there are three things i'd like to

366
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,920
see

367
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,560
all of us do even some things that we

368
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,160
can do

369
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,560
today that i think can help create a sea

370
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,639
change in our professional community and

371
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,638
the way we sometimes treat others in it

372
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,480
with all the negativity already out

373
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,440
there we need to start

374
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,000
by looking for ways to bring positivity

375
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,639
with us

376
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,440
into our professional lives it's like

377
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,440
ideally

378
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,279
we've been we've been looking for ways

379
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
to do this all the time but

380
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,880
i wanted to give you three concrete

381
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,880
steps so i just chose one example here

382
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,720
it's one of my favorite ways to build

383
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,480
others up though and that's just

384
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,480
finding a way to say thank you

385
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
we all have people who've helped us on

386
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,800
our security journey

387
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
they could be a professor a co-worker a

388
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,479
mentor

389
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,560
an open source tool developer or just

390
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,519
someone who's work that you admire

391
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,160
it could be that person's job their side

392
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,279
hustle

393
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,439
or something that they do just because

394
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
whoever they are and whatever they did

395
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
for you

396
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,240
helping others is the sort of thing we

397
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,040
need to promote so why not

398
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,519
reach out to them and let them know what

399
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,319
they

400
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,000
or their work has meant to you send them

401
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
an email or a tweet or

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,440
introduce yourself at a conference or

403
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,920
come up with your own way

404
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,079
it doesn't really take that much and a

405
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
little encouragement goes a very long

406
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,638
way

407
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,279
reaching out one-on-one in private is

408
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,760
great

409
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,480
but if you think it might be appropriate

410
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,199
doing it publicly has the added benefit

411
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
of demonstrating to others that

412
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
this is a thing that we do in our

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,680
community we build each other up

414
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,160
it contributes some real positivity in

415
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,439
what

416
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,800
can sometimes be a very negative space

417
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
i'll have a little bit more to say on

418
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,920
that later

419
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,399
they say never ask someone to do

420
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,319
something that you wouldn't do yourself

421
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
so i'd like to take a few minutes

422
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,279
to say a public thank you to someone

423
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,040
who's had a huge influence on my career

424
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,519
even though he may not have realized it

425
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,519
at the time

426
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,880
some of you may know richard baitlich

427
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,599
and many more of you probably know of

428
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,680
him

429
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
he's a thought leader but in the best

430
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,279
sense of the world because

431
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,519
it worked because even though he didn't

432
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,560
invent the concept of network security

433
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
monitoring

434
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
he probably did more than any other

435
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
person to promote

436
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
and to popularize it he's also just a

437
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,479
great human

438
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,639
who even if he disagrees with you will

439
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,079
do so in such a way as to be

440
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,360
both firm and yet civil at the same time

441
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,800
which can be a real trick sometimes

442
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,880
i first met richard that's met in quotes

443
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,279
because it was only online

444
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,279
shortly after i was assigned to review

445
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,600
his book the dao of network security

446
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,519
monitoring back in 2004

447
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,759
i'd been doing intrusion detection for a

448
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
little while and when i read the nsm

449
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,199
approach for the first time it just made

450
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,920
so much sense i had to try it right away

451
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,000
richard wrote about squeal an open

452
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,040
source nsm solution so that's where i

453
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,920
started getting it all set up though

454
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,360
proved a lot easier said than done and

455
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,719
richard and the other members of the

456
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
squeal project team were

457
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,720
very helpful and generous with their

458
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,880
time while i was trying to figure it out

459
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
i eventually joined this wheel team

460
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,199
myself where i had the chance to work

461
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,439
with

462
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,199
richard some more because of that a few

463
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,160
years later he invited me to come work

464
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
with him

465
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,199
when he was the director of general

466
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
electric cert

467
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,279
i remember telling my wife oh there's no

468
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,599
way i can say no to richard he just

469
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,680
invited me to work for him

470
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,199
richard has been a professional role

471
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,199
model for me and i can't

472
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,560
begin to count the number of times that

473
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,719
i've watched what

474
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,560
he did in a certain situation and then

475
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
later tried to copy him when i found

476
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,198
myself

477
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
in a similar place in my mind there's a

478
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,679
meandering but

479
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
very clear path in my career between

480
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,559
meeting him

481
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
and being here today as a keynote

482
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
speaker

483
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,799
so thank you richard you really helped

484
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
me a lot

485
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,199
and i don't know if you knew it at the

486
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,720
time but i'm very happy to be able to

487
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,199
tell the world just how much you helped

488
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,199
me today

489
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,520
being an actively good human of course

490
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,760
means that you have to put yourself out

491
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,918
there that's the active part you have to

492
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,160
participate in the community you have to

493
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,320
contribute in some way after all

494
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
can't be actively good without being

495
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,399
active right

496
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
you probably know the concept of paying

497
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,919
it forward and that's a big part of what

498
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,918
this is all about

499
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
we just talked about recognizing those

500
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
who have helped you along

501
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,360
so isn't the next logical step to do

502
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,840
what you can do

503
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,639
to return the favor by helping others

504
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,720
how you help that's up to you no one can

505
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,120
tell you the right way to do it it could

506
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,559
be as simple as engaging people in the

507
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,239
community

508
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,080
on twitter or in person if you're

509
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
comfortable with that you know asking

510
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,360
questions

511
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
answering them for others even just

512
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,280
sharing your opinions and observations

513
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
on professional matters in a respectful

514
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,440
way of course

515
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
if you learn a new skill or you come up

516
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
with a cool new hunting technique like

517
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
we're seeing here at the summit

518
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,960
please share it a blog post explaining

519
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
it to all the rest of us can be

520
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
extremely helpful

521
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
you might even come up here on stage

522
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,080
next year or at some other conference

523
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,799
and walk us through it in person

524
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,799
no matter who you are or where you are

525
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,480
in your security journey you do have

526
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,039
skills and experience

527
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
that the rest of us could benefit from

528
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,000
they don't even have to be

529
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,039
quote hard tech skills i mean that is my

530
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
specialty but

531
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,520
here i am talking to a technical

532
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,918
audience about something important that

533
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,080
has

534
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,240
absolutely nothing to do with technology

535
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
by sharing what we're good at with

536
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
others we not

537
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,760
are we're not only helping everyone else

538
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,360
grow but we're helping to drown out

539
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,799
those negative voices we're

540
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,000
amplifying the signal and making it ring

541
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,080
out over that toxic background noise

542
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,080
but it's not just about amplifying the

543
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
signal i already talked about how

544
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,918
important it is to call out the people

545
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,120
who have helped or influenced you on

546
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,760
your way up

547
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,399
by sharing what you're good at you're

548
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,360
opening yourself up to the possibility

549
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,120
of being one of those influencers

550
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
someone else is out there learning from

551
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,280
you maybe changing the way they think

552
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,320
about something for the better

553
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,320
maybe using a tool you wrote to

554
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,520
improve security or make their job

555
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,918
easier

556
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,280
better yet maybe they're even taking

557
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,919
what you did

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,720
and building on it with appropriate

559
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
credit to you

560
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,480
of course and then putting that back out

561
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,919
there for everyone

562
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
else to take advantage of the fact is

563
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,200
when you make a contribution to the

564
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
infosec community

565
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,520
you can't really know and probably will

566
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,879
never know the full effect of that

567
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
contribution

568
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,280
because your innovations fuel other

569
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,520
people's innovations

570
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,960
which go on to fuel other innovations

571
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,280
etc

572
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,720
they call it the virtuous cycle because

573
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,918
it repeats itself

574
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
over and over potentially making big

575
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
things happen

576
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,840
from what might have been of even a very

577
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,840
small beginning

578
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,960
last month i was a volunteer for the

579
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
career village with another conference

580
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,559
the diana initiative

581
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,320
i hope most of you have heard of it by

582
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,480
now probably some of you have attended

583
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,879
or maybe even volunteered there too

584
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
the diana initiative is specifically

585
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
organized around

586
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,918
themes of inclusion and diversity in the

587
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
infosec field

588
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,159
it's an event for everyone though it

589
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,639
does emphasize the fact that

590
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
members of underrepresented groups have

591
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,760
places in security

592
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,960
that we have a responsibility to provide

593
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,360
a level playing field

594
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
so everyone can compete on equal footing

595
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,399
and that all of us

596
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,360
should be given the same opportunities

597
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,440
to develop and advance

598
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,760
this year i think it was a little bit

599
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,559
over 1700 people who registered for the

600
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,158
diana initiative which is fantastic

601
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,158
but do you know how it started

602
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,320
started with just a small group of women

603
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,679
who met in a food court during defcon in

604
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,158
2015.

605
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,679
they got to talking and had an idea

606
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,360
about how great it would be to have an

607
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,120
event where they could get together and

608
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
share their experiences

609
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,760
working in infosec and where they could

610
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
monitor or excuse me mentor and support

611
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,799
other women

612
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,719
the next year and 2016 tierracon

613
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,120
became an official defcon event they had

614
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,600
panels workshops social events

615
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,600
and then the year after that in 2017 it

616
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,639
became a full-fledged conference in its

617
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,399
own right

618
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
it ran concurrently with defcon and

619
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,480
that's also when they changed their name

620
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,799
to the diana initiative

621
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,200
so for about the past five years they've

622
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
been enabling and advancing security

623
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,919
careers for

624
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,039
everyone with an emphasis on everyone

625
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,440
the ideas from that food court in 2015

626
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,919
hatched into a full-fledged event

627
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,559
supporting providing opportunities to a

628
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,960
diverse

629
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,480
group of practitioners and potential

630
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
practitioners

631
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,480
and they're in turn bringing their fresh

632
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,280
perspectives and

633
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,880
inspiring new ideas and getting involved

634
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
themselves to help others

635
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,280
i think this is a great idea a great

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,760
example of that virtuous cycle

637
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,760
in action

638
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,600
as i was preparing for this talk one of

639
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
the things i wanted to do was watch some

640
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,480
examples of

641
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,120
inspiring talks my favorite was a

642
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,200
2016 commencement speech that matt damon

643
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,439
gave to the graduating class at mit

644
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,720
in that talk he quotes some advice that

645
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,200
he was given

646
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,200
by former president bill clinton

647
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
president clinton's words were so much

648
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,280
better than the ones i wrote for this

649
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,559
slide

650
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,760
that um i decided to steal them

651
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,320
yes i stole them so i'm quoting matt

652
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,039
damon

653
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,918
quoting bill clinton when i say that the

654
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,000
final point

655
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
in my three-point action plan for

656
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,440
raising the tide in security

657
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,000
is this turn toward the problems

658
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
what does it mean to turn toward the

659
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,120
problems

660
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,960
well it's not enough to just recognize

661
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,320
that there are significant roadblocks

662
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
for people trying to get their first

663
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,439
jobs or

664
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,640
that actually want to participate in our

665
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
industry it's

666
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,600
it's not enough to deplore the pervasive

667
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,320
hostility and discrimination that some

668
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,600
people face

669
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,360
every day based on their gender or the

670
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
color of their skin or

671
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,799
whatever other kind of arbitrary out

672
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,200
group classification

673
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,240
other people impose on them it's not

674
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,919
enough to just

675
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,760
call out these problems like i did at

676
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,240
the beginning of this talk

677
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,440
we have to actually take some positive

678
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,080
steps to remove

679
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
those roadblocks to counter that

680
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,520
negativity

681
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
to boost the visibility and provide

682
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,879
equal opportunities for the people

683
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,640
affected the most

684
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,679
by the darker aspects of our

685
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
professional community

686
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,159
now how you do this again that's another

687
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,840
one of those things that's up to you

688
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,400
and it's probably going to be different

689
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,799
for everyone so for myself i started

690
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
at my day job at target and and even

691
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,639
before that

692
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,320
i try to think of my role in more than

693
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,520
just technical terms

694
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,559
it's not just my job to hunt threats

695
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,960
but it's it's also my job to lift up the

696
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,279
people around me

697
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
near the end of last year i committed to

698
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,960
my teammates that i would do a joint

699
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
conference presentation with each one of

700
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
them

701
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,279
i didn't quite succeed but i certainly

702
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
didn't fail

703
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,919
either those of you who attended last

704
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,879
year might have seen me up here on stage

705
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,279
with cat self

706
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,200
talking about how we revamped our

707
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,600
hunting program

708
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
and although i'm not actually presenting

709
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,039
with them this year you'll notice a

710
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,240
strong target contingent

711
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,840
among the summit speakers yesterday and

712
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,000
another coming up today with one of my

713
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,080
teammates

714
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,840
i've been trying to ramp up my efforts

715
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,840
outside my day job too

716
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,039
i've done a few rounds of mentoring

717
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,600
monday on twitter

718
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,760
for example where i invited basically

719
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,559
anyone to hit me up for career advice

720
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,919
and i still do by the way so dm me if i

721
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:40,158
can help you

722
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
i'm volunteering with the def con blue

723
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,960
team villages meet a mentor program

724
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
where we get matched up with mentees for

725
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,320
a longer

726
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,439
deeper longer term arrangement than we

727
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,639
can really do

728
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,720
during most twitter conversations

729
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
and i already mentioned of course that i

730
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
worked the defcon initiatives career

731
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,760
village this year

732
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,879
i'm not saying that you have to do the

733
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,080
same things

734
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,400
that i'm doing what works for me may

735
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,760
may not work for you but i know there is

736
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
something you can do

737
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,158
even if it's just finding the people who

738
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,158
are being targeted on twitter

739
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,600
and letting them know that you saw it

740
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,039
and you care

741
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,000
even that simple thing can mean a lot

742
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,760
and men i'm sorry to be the one to tell

743
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,799
you this but a disproportionate amount

744
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,559
of this burden

745
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,840
falls on us now that's partly

746
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,120
because we're typically among the least

747
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,760
vulnerable and therefore the most well

748
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,760
placed

749
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,120
to speak up and have an impact

750
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,679
but i'm sad to say it's mostly because

751
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,840
our fellow men are usually the ones to

752
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,679
blame for a lot of this bad behavior in

753
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,840
the first place

754
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,679
they need to see from everyone but

755
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,158
especially from other men

756
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,559
that what they're doing is unacceptable

757
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,559
and will no longer be silently tolerated

758
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,640
it's important that we not only hold

759
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,279
that attitude but

760
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,520
also that we demonstrate it in person

761
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,640
and online

762
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,918
because aside from the chance to change

763
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:19,039
behaviors on an individual level acting

764
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:22,480
on your beliefs in a public setting

765
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,120
normalizes those beliefs just a tiny bit

766
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,880
each time but when we're all doing it

767
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,879
those tiny bits add up

768
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,440
and it might not take as many of us as

769
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,799
you'd think to raise the tide

770
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,840
there was a 2018 survey by

771
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,840
dr damon sintola a professor in the

772
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,000
annenberg school for communication at

773
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,720
the university of pennsylvania

774
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,320
who found that in any given group once

775
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,120
about a quarter of them

776
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,158
of the members committed to a change the

777
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,719
rest of the group

778
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,520
followed and the change became the

779
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,039
group's new

780
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,279
normal now his his experiment

781
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,840
had random groups of volunteers who were

782
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,320
asked to look at pictures of different

783
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,199
people

784
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,399
or objects and agree on a name for those

785
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,399
people or objects

786
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,918
and that turned out to be fairly quick

787
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,439
and straightforward

788
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,760
once the group agreed on the name the re

789
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
researchers introduced activist groups

790
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,919
of different sizes to try to

791
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,279
convince the community to change that

792
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,880
name to something else

793
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
and what they found was that when the

794
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,520
activists made up at least

795
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,480
25 percent of the group they were able

796
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,799
to change the names for everyone

797
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,960
of course 25 percent of the information

798
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,720
security community is a lot

799
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,640
but keep in mind that the researchers

800
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,200
weren't saying that you absolutely

801
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,399
require the entire 25 percent in order

802
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,760
to make any change at

803
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,760
all think of it more like an upper bound

804
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,039
and if there's an upper bound then is

805
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,039
there a lower bound

806
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,880
another study this time from dr erica

807
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,399
chinowith as a public policy professor

808
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,440
at harvard

809
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,399
used real incidents from recent history

810
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,799
to examine the role of non-violent civil

811
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,600
disobedience in societal change and she

812
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,960
found something fascinating

813
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,959
no movement involving at least 3.5

814
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,080
percent of the group population

815
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,120
failed to be successful certainly

816
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,520
movements with

817
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,559
lower population could be and were

818
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,840
successful

819
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,639
but once they hit that magic number of

820
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,320
3.5 percent

821
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,840
change was virtually assured

822
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,799
now why is that well in part i think

823
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,639
because people like to back a winner dr

824
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,120
chenoweth said and i quote

825
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,760
the visibility of civil resistance

826
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,879
actions

827
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,960
allows them to attract more active and

828
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,240
diverse participation from the

829
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,360
ambivalent people

830
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,840
end quote in other words it's important

831
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,039
for us

832
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,120
not only to disapprove

833
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
of the attitudes and behaviors that are

834
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,360
holding our industry back

835
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,158
but to demonstrate our disapproval

836
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,360
publicly in order to attract more people

837
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,320
to our cause if you're thinking that the

838
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,279
difference between

839
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,918
3.5 percent and 25 percent seems pretty

840
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,240
big

841
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,279
you're right on the one hand we can

842
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,760
think of these as

843
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,679
lower and upper bounds for the number of

844
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,640
people we might need

845
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,720
out there taking positive action it's a

846
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,080
perfectly valid interpretation of what

847
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,799
might seem like

848
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,520
conflicting data points but i wonder if

849
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,080
these two data points really do conflict

850
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,240
so dr chenoweth says that the visibility

851
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,639
of the actions was an important factor

852
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
in

853
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,039
recruiting uncommitted people to the

854
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,880
movements

855
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,520
maybe and i think even likely

856
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,399
a smaller number of people who care and

857
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,559
show that they care on a regular basis

858
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,678
can convince enough other people to do

859
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,678
the same until we reach that 25

860
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,880
tipping point maybe that initial number

861
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,880
can be as small as the number of people

862
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,480
who are watching this talk today either

863
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,480
live or later on recorded

864
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,039
all right we've covered a lot of ground

865
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,039
so

866
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,158
let me sum up try to make this simple

867
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,640
i'm asking just

868
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,919
three things from each of you starting

869
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
today

870
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,120
first let's commit to fighting

871
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,518
negativity by generating positivity in

872
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,799
our professional discourse

873
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,120
one great way to do this not the only

874
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,120
way but one great way to do this is to

875
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,039
show your gratitude to those

876
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,199
who have helped you along or influenced

877
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,720
your career or even just made your job

878
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,960
somehow easier

879
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,600
especially if you are willing to do it

880
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,600
publicly

881
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,679
we have a break coming up right after

882
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,720
i'm done talking

883
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,600
so you know what would be really great

884
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,320
what if everyone listening right now

885
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,240
took just

886
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,279
a couple of minutes of that break to

887
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,919
send an email a text a tweet

888
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,200
whatever to someone who helped you give

889
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,240
them a sincere

890
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,640
thank you in public if possible

891
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,760
i guarantee it'll make their day and

892
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
you'll feel great

893
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,399
knowing that you contributed a little

894
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,399
positivity today

895
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,880
next let's find ways to pay it forward

896
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,640
by getting involved in the community

897
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
everyone's involvement will look

898
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840
different

899
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,679
and that's great you might offer your

900
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,559
thoughts in a blog post or a tweet you

901
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,559
might teach workshops at conferences

902
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,080
uh you might do some volunteer work for

903
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,000
an organization

904
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,480
that you believe in whatever works for

905
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,559
you

906
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,600
put something out there that others can

907
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,799
be

908
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,120
by or build on remember even the

909
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,080
smallest contributions now can be the

910
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,639
start of something big

911
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,399
and finally let's remember that

912
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,440
identifying a problem

913
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,080
is not enough to actually solve it when

914
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
we see

915
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,918
something wrong we need to ask ourselves

916
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,039
what we can do to make things better

917
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,760
even

918
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,760
just a little better and then do it

919
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
now i know my simple three-point plan is

920
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,919
just that

921
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,360
it's simple you might be looking at it

922
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,720
and saying david this

923
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,240
is this is naive this is

924
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,799
never going to work i don't know it's

925
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,799
not a full solution

926
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,639
it's not a full solution by any means

927
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,080
but i think of it as a

928
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,360
good base it's like a set of tools that

929
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,360
we can use

930
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,399
to help us start building the other

931
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,760
tools that we

932
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,239
need to solve these problems so i hope

933
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,360
you'll join me in looking for and

934
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,320
taking those chances to raise up

935
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,199
those around you together i know that we

936
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,678
absolutely

937
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,640
can raise the tide for everyone in

938
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,840
security

939
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,840
thank you

940
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,040
you
