um tennis is going to be talking to us

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,560
about the uh hunting

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,119
immaturity model now we've seen the

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
hunting maturity model the hmm

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,238
and uh we're gonna be looking at this

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
with a little bit of a different

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,239
perspective which i think you're gonna

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
appreciate so um that'll said taz uh

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,040
we're glad to have you here thank you

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
for joining us and uh sharing some of

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
your your knowledge

22
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
with us today um happy to turn this over

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,039
to you

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,839
and see what you've got for the

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
immaturity model

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,640
all right good morning everyone

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,680
uh thank you so much for being here

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,120
yeah uh as interested by phil uh today

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,920
i'll be talking about the hunting in my

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
three model

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,840
uh it is actually a parody of uh i think

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,920
maturity model that

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,920
uh probably all of you know uh it's

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
created by uh

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
the one and only dave bianco it was a

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,520
great talk he presented this morning

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,240
i think it's a really important issue

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,039
that we all need to be aware of uh thank

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,399
you so much for

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,240
presenting that dave and yes

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
so about this model uh first of all

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,079
uh let me introduce myself uh because

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
actually this is my very first time

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,960
presenting in the summit

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
uh i'm a manga test donda i usually go

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
by tas

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,640
i'm a threat hunter for uh one of the

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
major canadian telecom company

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,799
who also do isp you also do technology

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,520
stuff

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,840
so pretty much they do everything but on

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
the job itself uh what i do mainly is

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
straight hunting

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
which also involves research and

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,600
detection development

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
we do some trade intelligence working

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,520
with ioc by plan etc

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,479
dfir and of course in this modern day

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,119
automation is everywhere outside of work

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
outside of

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,560
uh you know like staring at logs and

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,200
stuff i do

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
enjoy uh doing astro photography i

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,599
actually added some of my

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,200
pictures that i'm pretty proud of

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,519
so it's just nice being out there

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,799
looking at the stars i also enjoy

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
of course cooking music when i'm

69
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
away from a keyboard if you would like

70
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,518
to connect with me i put my twitter

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,120
there my linkedin

72
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:39,519
and also my github when i usually posted

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,519
presentation slides my research etc

74
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,079
so first of all disclaimer the views

75
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
thoughts and opinions expressed in this

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
presentation

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,640
belong solely to me the author and not

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,920
from

79
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,720
my employer my organization comedy or

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,839
other group or individuals

81
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,920
so first of all uh before go to the

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
hunting material model i think it's

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,079
important for us to

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
just look back took a glance on the what

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,599
is a hunting maturity model

86
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
the one that i do parody of so what it

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,079
is and why

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,000
and we'll go to the hunting maturity

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
model again

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
what and why and then we'll go to each

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
level in details from level

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,319
zero to level minus one minus two minus

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,440
three and minus four

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,319
so disclaimer again

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
although this talk is a parody from the

96
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,280
hunting maturity model

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
there is no intention to make fun of hmm

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,040
uh in fact

99
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,798
this talk will show how hmm is actually

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
really good metric to follow for you to

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
grow your

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,720
uh hunting programs uh i'm actually

103
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,360
i personally believe in that so i will

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,519
try to

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,120
show what's my perspective on that to

106
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,120
you via these few slides

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,000
so hunting maturity model uh what it is

108
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
it is actually

109
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,599
it will show you the hunting capability

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
uh in

111
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
in an organization it will range from

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
level zero

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,920
to level four so there's like five

114
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,280
different levels

115
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,000
and it is based on certain focus points

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
so how you collect your data how your

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,440
team

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,519
create hypothesis on hunting how do you

119
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,199
use your tools and how do you use

120
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
techniques can you do any pattern or ttp

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
detection mechanism

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
and lastly an analytics automation we

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
are talking about

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,560
big data machine learning etc

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,520
so five stages of hmm

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,479
level zero is initial on minimal but to

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
procedural

128
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,360
innovative and the last level which is

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,880
for leading

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
and then again on the left you can see

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
the characteristic how you collect data

132
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,639
hypothesis creation etc

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,840
and then you can see on the top uh the

134
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,840
way uh the level itself so for example

135
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,080
data collection on level zero you have

136
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,679
little to no data collection which is

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,599
fine because you're level zero you're

138
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
just starting and then if you go

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
up to the right you'll see in the

140
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,799
highest one you have like high data

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
collection of many types throughout the

142
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
it environment

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
which you should have when you are

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
leading in the threat hunting

145
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,320
so same idea go if you go down the

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
column

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,120
uh you will see more and information on

148
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,638
this

149
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
so why why you such a mem

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
it stated that it can give the

151
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
organization a granular view

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,400
of what hunting process steps that they

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,599
need to

154
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,799
take to improve and then to go to the

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,639
next stage of the hunting maturity

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
so again the improvement of course you

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,840
can do data source gap analysis so you

158
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,198
can tell which data source i need to

159
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
acquire next

160
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,240
uh hunting ideas sources so you can

161
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,479
start from

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
you know just go to twitter maybe you

163
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,120
can just start

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,280
uh looking to your own inventory looking

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,039
to your own crown jewels

166
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,880
maybe you can thinking what tools i need

167
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,039
to buy next uh

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
again just like the data source of

169
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,680
course you can do detection gap analysis

170
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
once you know which data source you need

171
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
you can build detection on top of it

172
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,000
and lastly an analytics acquisition so

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
you can start hiring data scientists you

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
can start hiring

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
more people that can work on the big

176
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
data security engineers

177
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,919
and also getting all those required

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,319
infrastructure which is

179
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,080
really a big problem sometimes when you

180
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,199
don't have it

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,560
so uh what goes up

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
uh must come down uh so i i saw this

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,919
meme

184
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,800
uh on twitter credits to four octets uh

185
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,840
uh i do believe not all of the company

186
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,120
are like this but i'm

187
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,359
pretty sure there are some companies are

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,960
doing it like this so this is just not

189
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
how you thread hunting

190
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,799
not just by using a framework no

191
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,639
loggings

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,560
no protection information gather so

193
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,080
there are sets of things that you need

194
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,400
to have before you

195
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
do tread hunting so again what goes up

196
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,318
must come down

197
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,319
so first of all and

198
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
the most important of all uh tear

199
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,639
hunting is not

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
fun and easy it's not always fun and

201
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,080
easy

202
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
so i asked numerous people uh what are

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560
some challenges that

204
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,240
they have faced or or are facing in the

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,319
world of tread hunting detection

206
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
engineering etc you'll you'll probably

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,720
know some of these names because

208
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,359
it's a small water uh for example for

209
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,919
samir

210
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,599
wizardine uh you say like it's too much

211
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
confidence in your own detection so

212
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,400
you're being too proud of your own

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
detection so that's not good uh for

214
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,560
matthews online it's my

215
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,719
friend my ex-co-worker and my mentor

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
also so not everyone

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
is a good person for threat hunters so

218
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,319
you need a certain traits to be a good

219
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,759
threat hunter

220
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
so one of the trade i think is

221
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
persistence just like apt

222
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,479
we also need to be persistence in

223
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,520
detecting them

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,599
david david bianco mentioned well

225
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,639
even if you agree on definition many

226
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,000
people can

227
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,319
misunderstand the purpose of three

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,360
hunting which is i see

229
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,520
a lot everywhere tony lambert

230
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,039
uh mentioned uh simply not having some

231
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,758
sort of feedback loop to learn and

232
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,039
improve

233
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,560
so exactly uh

234
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,560
what some years say if you're too

235
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,360
confident on your detection you're just

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,879
like

237
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
not having any feedback because of it

238
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
because you're just too proud of it and

239
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,079
lastly all of our tom

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,919
mentioned building a team because of its

241
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,640
buzzword

242
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,360
and equip with people that want to do it

243
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,598
because

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
it's just cool i mean the title it's

245
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,000
cool trend hunting but the job itself

246
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,399
when i when i started i asked around

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
what is there hunting and then

248
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,920
i get a response on writing it's pretty

249
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
much yeah i just look at logs uh

250
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
i can kind of confirm that it's kind of

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,839
true you'll

252
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
you'll interact a lot with locks but of

253
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,040
course you'll do

254
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,040
some other cool stuff so

255
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,640
uh moving forward let's talk about

256
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,000
hunting a maturity model

257
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,439
the main talk

258
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,160
in this talk which is i think a material

259
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,160
model is

260
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,319
uh pretty much the long-lost writer of

261
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,319
hmm hunting maturity model

262
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,640
so this model will instead provide you

263
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,160
with common mistakes then

264
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,199
common success that the han teams or

265
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,839
their management

266
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,320
have made and it will be divided into

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,480
five

268
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
uh several levels just like hmm

269
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,880
uh it will base also on certain focus

270
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
point just like hmm

271
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
uh for the first one will be dedicated

272
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,680
personal the second one

273
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,920
uh management understanding of threat

274
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
hunting the han organization

275
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
planning uh prioritization and

276
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
capability

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,399
uh the integration with the rest of the

278
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,640
security body in the organization

279
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,760
and then lastly cicd continuous

280
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,839
improvement deployment

281
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,120
and also learning so five stages of

282
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,440
him so

283
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
just like different with the hmm this

284
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
one is a bit

285
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
it's actually flat so there's no bad

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,360
numbers but in my personal opinion the

287
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,399
last level is the worst

288
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,279
so level zero no hunters level

289
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,160
minus one hunter's question mark level

290
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,399
minus two

291
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,839
confused hunters uh minus three

292
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,040
disconnected hunters

293
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,839
and level minus four ignorant hunters

294
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
so why use this uh well these are real

295
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,480
mistakes

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
a cure in real organization with my

297
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
conversation with people

298
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,439
looking back to my organization just

299
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,680
studying from everywhere

300
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,480
you can use this model to avoid those

301
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
mistakes

302
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,959
without making the mistake itself which

303
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,119
is priceless right well alternatively

304
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,040
if you see yourself in one of them you

305
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,079
can help yourself

306
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
by following some of the tips how to get

307
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,120
out

308
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,319
that i mentioned in this presentation

309
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,320
so you will learn in the different areas

310
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
that i mentioned before so management

311
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
understanding of threatening

312
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,439
organization planning characterization

313
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,360
integration with the rest of security

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,200
body ci cd

315
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
and avoid it that's the most important

316
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,000
thing you need to avoid it

317
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,839
if you if you go uh watch this

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
presentation you finish you go back and

319
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
then you still do it

320
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,680
this presentation is useless so please

321
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,760
use this to avoid it

322
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,760
uh okay let's talk about each levels in

323
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,519
details

324
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,920
so uh level zero no hunters what it is

325
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,000
uh so who are they who are these people

326
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,199
what's a word organization that is on

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
level zero so they're

328
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
usually a relatively new sock or

329
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,640
security body

330
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,560
they have other priorities of course

331
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
hunting is not in picture yet which is

332
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
completely fine

333
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,839
it is not the first picture and security

334
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,839
bodies in anywhere

335
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
so they focus on other things for

336
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,120
example hiring the right people

337
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
conducting training incidence response

338
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,639
creation

339
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,719
for the procedure and planning

340
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
building up infrastructure architecture

341
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,279
and also boarding logs and data searches

342
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
this is

343
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,439
really important things to do first well

344
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,519
they realize heavily on what vendors

345
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
provided which is completely fine

346
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,040
because that's what vendors supposed to

347
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,880
do will provide you with content so you

348
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,279
can use right away

349
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,920
and they start learning uh how to use

350
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,839
defender tools they play around with the

351
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,920
you know like uh settings and stuff like

352
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,639
that and they create uh their own

353
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,920
procedure for each tools which is a good

354
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,880
thing to do at start

355
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,680
so how do you get out from there to hmm

356
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,399
level one

357
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,599
not to him level one but to the hmm

358
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,839
level one

359
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,360
so first of all take some time be mature

360
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,120
enough because it's not

361
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,800
terra hunting is not intended for newly

362
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
formed security but

363
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,639
i don't think some people will not like

364
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
it when i say that but it is the truth

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,120
so you need to prepare a lot of stuff

366
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,359
for the trending capability

367
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
so log in capability the first of them

368
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,639
uh you can get

369
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,560
uh what sources you need from minor

370
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,079
attack and you can look inside what you

371
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
have currently

372
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,359
you need to document security

373
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,959
infrastructure really well that includes

374
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
asset management

375
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,399
having people that understand your

376
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,560
organization network and architecture

377
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
like really understand it in and out

378
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
create and document good incident

379
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
response process

380
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
don't make uh incentives from process

381
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
like the meme on the side

382
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
so just say like just read documentation

383
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
but the documentation doesn't make any

384
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,040
sense so don't do that make a good

385
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,600
insider response

386
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,079
process good make a good documentation

387
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,839
and again

388
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,680
you will need under analysts that

389
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
understand every single step of the

390
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
incident response process so when

391
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,279
something happened they know what to do

392
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,040
so most of the time the first try hunter

393
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
is actually an ex-analyst

394
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
so because they have the understanding

395
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,000
of the organization network

396
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,120
and then they just know pretty much

397
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,880
all the process inside the company

398
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,040
so moving forward to the him -1

399
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,320
hunter's question mark why there's a

400
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
question mark in there

401
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,720
because uh they do have uh at least one

402
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,000
try hunting member

403
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,000
or it's just their title uh and

404
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,760
oftentimes the reason uh behind the

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
hiring person is just because of the

406
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,839
hype of the

407
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
you know electro hunting so just like ai

408
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,000
sor

409
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,959
e slash xdr you name uh this stuff

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,639
there's a lot of them and because of the

411
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,160
buzzword

412
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,120
they don't actually prepare to do tear

413
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
hunting operation

414
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,000
so they they have no proper consumer of

415
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,279
the rules which is the sock 24 7

416
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,480
monitoring

417
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,839
they have no logging capability or small

418
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,760
logging capability that is not

419
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,760
they have tons of expensive security

420
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,480
tools but it's not configured properly

421
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,319
because they

422
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
might not have like an engineer to do

423
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
that

424
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
and no infrastructure or an engineering

425
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,320
team to support

426
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,480
a trending operation for example uh

427
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,000
the trending team might need to spin up

428
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
their own sim that doesn't make sense

429
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,760
that's not what our hunting team do

430
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,880
that's what engineers do

431
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,880
so the question mark is for

432
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,399
the management do they even know what

433
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,360
their hunting is so

434
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,079
they actually don't know what is after

435
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,639
hunting

436
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,479
like what is the proper return hunting

437
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,000
so they make a mistake assuming what is

438
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
the role of three hunting is

439
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
such as they do tarantal work all the

440
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
time so they're just monitoring threat

441
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,720
from the outside

442
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,920
but but threat hunting is more looking

443
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,839
what on the inside

444
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,040
and compare it to what bad things

445
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,440
outside

446
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
and then most of the times triang turns

447
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
her

448
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,359
ack as a level three level four for

449
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
sock analysts so they are doing

450
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,519
incinerous one all the time

451
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,360
and hunting it's just a side activities

452
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,480
but their their title is trey hunter so

453
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,120
that's not how it works

454
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,000
and lastly as i mentioned before uh

455
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,759
triangles transfer working

456
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
on defender tools working on the seam

457
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,480
working on the edr

458
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,440
configuring stuff it's just more

459
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
engineering

460
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
and not really hunting slice threat

461
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
research

462
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,279
thing to do how do you get out from

463
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,399
that uh still related to the last level

464
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,120
uh don't jump to the boat too quick

465
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
uh be a mature sock first get your

466
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,600
things

467
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
done first then start thinking about

468
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,800
building for ending team

469
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,719
again as i mentioned before in the last

470
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,319
level promote your best analysts if the

471
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,000
person is suitable

472
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,000
to be our first ever hunters because

473
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
they know everything and again prepare

474
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,279
your infrastructure and tools

475
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,199
and as a management as a leader of the

476
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,320
trending team you can inform yourself on

477
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,319
the trending practices

478
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
for example this conference is a great

479
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,279
place to do

480
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,199
there's a lot of case study and

481
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,880
presentation there's literally a million

482
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,120
of them on the internet

483
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,000
use common frameworks to start hmm is

484
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,040
great hunting

485
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
cycle it's great pyramidal fan is good

486
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,120
for

487
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,680
aiming what to detect also frameworks

488
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,399
such as

489
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,599
mario attack ckc you can use it to build

490
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,240
content

491
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,280
and of course us help when needed uh you

492
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,319
know when you need help

493
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,119
as uh from community you can even hire

494
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,438
like seasoned

495
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,479
uh team leader or you can pay consulting

496
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,319
firm because

497
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,520
these days they also provide their

498
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,520
hunting services and

499
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,918
they are good at it because that's what

500
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,359
people pay them for

501
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,799
so next level it's level -2 which is

502
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,079
confused hunters

503
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,639
so they have dedicated personal uh right

504
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,480
tests

505
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
right skill set management know what

506
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,000
they have to do but

507
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,439
there's a but here uh they're dedicated

508
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
but they are disorganized for some

509
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
reason uh so so they're

510
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
hunting operation it's just like ad hoc

511
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,639
it feels like a side

512
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,080
task for them so because they have no

513
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
structure process

514
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,399
and they have no clear goal of what to

515
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,160
hunt are we making detection

516
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,799
are we detecting gaps etc

517
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,160
and again it is supported with no

518
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,480
documentation

519
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
uh on hunting has been completed what

520
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
are the consequences

521
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
well different members can perform the

522
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,280
same hand twice

523
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,280
because of that or worse same member

524
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,678
performed twice maybe this year you do

525
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,639
like

526
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,440
dns hunting and then next year he did it

527
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
again because

528
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,799
nobody remembered that they did it last

529
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,000
year so that's really bad

530
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,000
waste of time waste of money

531
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,559
and it's really important to do plan

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,640
planning and prioritization

533
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,480
but on this level they don't have that

534
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
you have limited or no planning

535
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
improvisation at all

536
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
because they don't follow any framework

537
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,280
usually so

538
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,240
minor attack is great uh to set your

539
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
goal

540
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,520
uh you can build your own of course from

541
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
your internal report or your risk

542
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,760
assessment

543
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,760
team's report but it's going to be

544
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,120
harder but you need a framework to start

545
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,559
working on

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,799
but when you have framework you you

547
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,799
cannot just take it raw as it is

548
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,440
you need to compare it with what what

549
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,280
you have don't try to cover minor attack

550
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,720
from like t 1000 to like t 1

551
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,200
500 like alphabetically you should look

552
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,200
into

553
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,039
your environment and ask question is

554
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,160
this attack even applicable to us

555
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,840
is it important uh

556
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
do we have like a linux server can we

557
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,320
use it or not so

558
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,199
and then when they try to plan and

559
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
prioritize

560
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
they might prioritize the wrong things

561
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,440
again

562
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
they say okay let's do windows server

563
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
because it is our crown jewels

564
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,639
like our main website is hosted in

565
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
windows server

566
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,919
that's what the risk assessment team say

567
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,679
and they say okay let's do that

568
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,840
but when they look go to their sim they

569
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,360
log in they'll look for the index they

570
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
look for the data source okay we don't

571
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,399
see any windows servers you only see

572
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,439
uh windows endpoints so they cannot do

573
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
the work so

574
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,960
make sure to have some you know like

575
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
requirement

576
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
done first before you do the hunting on

577
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
something

578
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,559
that that also something that you need

579
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
to think about when you're prioritizing

580
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
something

581
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,960
so how do you get out from there

582
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,879
organization

583
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,559
how do you organize a good hunting so

584
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,640
you perform one

585
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,559
ideal close to perfect hunting in your

586
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,240
opinion and then take note of all the

587
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,000
steps taken

588
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,600
and then you formalize that create

589
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,360
documentation to support it put it

590
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,760
somewhere that everyone everyone can see

591
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
it

592
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,360
improve and adjust it over time maybe

593
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,720
you can refute every six months every

594
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,879
year etc

595
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
and do documentation as a habit because

596
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,120
it's always correct to have

597
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
documentation ready

598
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,439
when you need it planning and

599
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,280
prioritization uh follow the framework

600
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
please don't don't be just like i don't

601
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,678
need framework no you need framework

602
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,799
you can create your own but it's harder

603
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,640
look inside what

604
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,280
uh your organization first you can ask

605
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,360
these questions what is our crown jewels

606
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,960
what visibility and what what logging do

607
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,639
we have inside

608
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,799
severity and probability of the attack

609
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,640
so it's cost benefit analysis

610
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,840
and lastly do we have capability to

611
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,240
deploy detection

612
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,199
for example if you detecting like

613
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
advanced

614
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
data extraction you probably need

615
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
machine learning you need data

616
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
scientists

617
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,559
don't try to tackle that if you don't

618
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
have data scientists or like a good sim

619
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,600
with a machine learning capability

620
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
because you will fail for sure and again

621
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,439
assess the framework against the

622
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,080
priority the question that you just

623
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,559
asked

624
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,678
when it's overlaps that's when you start

625
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,960
uh that's

626
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,799
that those are the stuff that you want

627
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,880
to prioritize so

628
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
my friend my mentor here have a great

629
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,240
talk uh

630
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,919
on the planning and prioritization using

631
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,640
attack so

632
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,919
he called it suck counter attack so it's

633
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,240
really great talk

634
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,919
i put the link there so you can watch it

635
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,200
it's it is really irritable

636
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,159
for for this particular information hi

637
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,720
minus three disconnected hunters so what

638
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
are they

639
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,960
who are they they have dedicated

640
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,960
personal great skill

641
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
they have good organization good

642
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,760
planning good prioritization

643
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,080
management understand them uh but they

644
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,879
operated in the disconnected exclusive

645
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,280
bubble

646
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,120
in the organization itself so they

647
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,158
they're pretty much like a pipeline of

648
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,000
detection so they make quality research

649
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
that push decent detection rules

650
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
dashboard to production

651
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,639
but that's the end of it they don't have

652
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
any connection with the rest of the

653
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
security of racing

654
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,559
operating center or a security body

655
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,200
in the organization so who can you work

656
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,360
with

657
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,360
well there's multiple people you can

658
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,639
work with you got work with management

659
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,399
your boss your boss boss some analysts

660
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,559
an incident responder

661
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,039
infrastructure and architecture people

662
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,520
red team va pen tests all the offensive

663
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,919
people

664
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200
whatever you call them risk assessment

665
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,600
or intelligence people

666
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,480
and then lastly development team how do

667
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,840
you can

668
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,600
get out from this level of this

669
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,080
connection right

670
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,199
so for each different roles i mentioned

671
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,320
something that you can do

672
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,720
so management you need to show them

673
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,480
your progress in coverage there's a lot

674
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
of tools you can use you can use

675
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,760
you can build your own music matter

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,799
attack

677
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,120
like a navigator or you can use detect

678
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,918
it's pretty good to use that you can

679
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,760
provide

680
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,919
feedback on yearly plans for example

681
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,039
okay we are missing a bunch of logs

682
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,039
maybe it's time for us to do logs

683
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,240
onboarding next year

684
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,240
for stock analysts and incident

685
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,880
responder you can give them training on

686
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,720
some

687
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,360
difficult ttp triage

688
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,760
for example kerber roasting not everyone

689
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,678
over

690
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,120
roasting but if you tell them if you

691
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,559
taught them what is kebab roasting

692
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,320
they'll understand when it when the

693
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,960
ticket comes to them okay this is cable

694
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
roasting and

695
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,039
i know what to do provide good

696
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,879
documentation

697
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,158
on the detection that you have built so

698
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
when they need

699
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,679
uh when they need to know what what are

700
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
you detecting they can just go to the

701
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
page and then

702
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
okay this makes sense and lastly false

703
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,880
positive

704
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,439
it is real and it is really

705
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,400
like a big problem in in terms of 24 7

706
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,840
ticketing

707
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,919
uh can introduce like fatigue to them so

708
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
work with them to reduce the false

709
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,520
positive

710
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,039
infrastructure architecture you can

711
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,120
identify logging gaps

712
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,320
and tell them hey we are missing this

713
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,600
and then go to the management and

714
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,760
management say yes okay

715
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,039
it's time to board these logs and you

716
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
can mention them

717
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,960
possible tools to be acquired uh for

718
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,200
example minor attack have like uh

719
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
the tools assessment they tried against

720
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,640
certain ttps

721
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
and you can tell them well based on this

722
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,159
you know like study

723
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,760
distiller better but we have you know

724
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,840
like have discussion with them regarding

725
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,080
what tools can be acquired

726
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,639
and i re recommend configuration changes

727
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,199
for example sysmon os query audit with

728
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
all of them need to be configured so you

729
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
know what is good configuration is

730
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,559
because you

731
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,158
you you try to detect stuff using them

732
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,918
so you can tell them hey we might need

733
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,960
to enable

734
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,039
dll loading on sysmon monitoring for

735
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,279
this specific dlls because it's being

736
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,000
used by for example

737
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,360
metasploit or other tools again moving

738
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,480
to the offensive

739
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,320
security people well incorporate them uh

740
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,640
into purple timing exercise for example

741
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,600
kerber roasting it's hard to do if

742
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
you're

743
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,520
in the tour hunting team so just you

744
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,678
know go to their room and like

745
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,559
hey can you help us with cargo roasting

746
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,039
because they

747
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,639
have proper offensive infrastructure and

748
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,039
for sometimes for them it's just one

749
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,159
click

750
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,480
and everything like go blasting

751
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,760
the tgt all the silver tickets just

752
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
flying around

753
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,360
you can you can ask them for help

754
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
and then work together to detect it risk

755
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,000
assessment intelligence i mentioned it

756
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,200
earlier to build

757
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
your priority priority so learn about

758
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,799
crown jewels

759
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,320
learn about uh any actors that start

760
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,158
getting you any new

761
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,840
techniques from tech intelligence

762
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,240
community and then lastly

763
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,600
development team learn on the

764
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,679
application itself

765
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,520
for example your your company making

766
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
applications so you need to learn

767
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
what the application do so you can

768
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,159
understand the logs

769
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,080
and you can suggest improvement on the

770
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,360
login function okay

771
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,720
for example on the logging page

772
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,520
i think we need to lock the failed

773
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,640
logins because we can detect brute force

774
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,400
via that logs and they'll probably say

775
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,600
okay that's a good idea and it's easy to

776
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
implement and then

777
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,439
that's a better security posture for

778
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
both of you

779
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,279
last level hi minus four ignoring

780
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
hunters

781
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,960
who are they they pretty much tick all

782
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,080
the good things

783
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,480
except they are ignoring a lot of

784
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,840
side responsibilities that is still

785
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
important

786
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,520
it can be during or after the hunting

787
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,039
and detection creation

788
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,720
they are making a lot of assumption

789
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,039
because they are big headed they just

790
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,240
like

791
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,720
i know everything and then because of

792
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
that

793
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,320
they also lack of improvements and

794
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,360
relearning so they don't want to do that

795
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,520
at all

796
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,439
so what are some of the traits so blind

797
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,440
hunting with a lot of assumptions

798
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,640
so for example open source detection

799
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
tools

800
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,480
let's say the elastic uh rule repo

801
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,520
or like sigma so they just take that

802
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,919
blindly

803
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,600
and put it in the production without

804
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,640
really performing emulation of the

805
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,120
technique

806
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,880
because they say okay this is a this is

807
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,279
uh they have like 500 stars

808
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
on github so it's going to be good but

809
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,640
not always that because

810
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,080
every single environment is different

811
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,840
even your lab

812
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,520
and your production environment will be

813
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,840
different in the same company

814
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,679
so when you're testing something in the

815
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,600
lab you need to make sure that it is the

816
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,919
same configuration in the production so

817
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
the alert will work itself

818
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,520
the second one ignoring that the

819
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,840
detection is interconnected system

820
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,960
so no understanding of logging

821
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,158
engineering

822
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,320
configuration deployment limitation uh

823
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,679
and also no understanding of sim because

824
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
that's pretty much the main tools

825
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,520
they're working in

826
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,719
there's like things like field mapping

827
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,158
data parsing

828
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,600
limitation on computational power so

829
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,679
they just completely ignore that you

830
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,199
don't have to be a master in this but

831
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,039
you need to know some of them you need

832
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
to understand the limitation and stuff

833
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,520
like that

834
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,120
the next one will be no continuous

835
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,000
detection monitoring so there is no

836
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,559
cicd pipeline i would say so you need to

837
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,279
test

838
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,000
uh your rules your detection every

839
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,600
single time

840
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,640
almost every day because

841
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,080
something will go wrong eventually

842
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,760
you just know that for a fact anywhere

843
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,840
in the pipeline can go wrong so i need

844
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,559
to test it you need you can deploy rte

845
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,559
or art or you can buy like a

846
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,600
like a premium solution from different

847
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,760
companies

848
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,039
and they also have no audit process for

849
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,039
example to check the

850
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,520
false positive rate or to check missing

851
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,559
documentation missing trainings for the

852
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
analysts

853
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,120
uh so yeah those are not good if you

854
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,399
doing it no improvement in learning

855
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,279
because they are too confident of

856
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,600
whether they have developed

857
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,200
they see no points of redoing ttps for

858
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,240
example there is matter attack okay we

859
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,240
cover everything

860
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,880
no that's not how it works because motor

861
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,679
attack it's constantly updated every few

862
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,399
months

863
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,919
so you need to look into it you need to

864
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,760
go outside just learn

865
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,120
about new stuff you need to redo some

866
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,799
stuff sometimes

867
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,520
and because of that they're also not

868
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,760
taking effort to learn logging mechanism

869
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,080
again for example go to dev team like

870
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,879
okay what is this custom apps doing can

871
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
you tell us

872
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,640
or talk to network security people like

873
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,520
can you help us understand

874
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,399
this juniper logs this cisco logs

875
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,039
because

876
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,158
i don't think all tire hunters know

877
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,320
network security stuff really well

878
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,360
so getting out from there you need to

879
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,279
perform

880
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,799
all the required test emulation tests

881
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:38,399
when building something

882
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,399
it's emulation

883
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
it's needed from the start to the end so

884
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,918
from the

885
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,520
source of the logs your proxy your

886
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,440
endpoint your server

887
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,480
all the way to the alert creation and

888
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,000
the sim all the way to the ticketing

889
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,039
so and also when you review open source

890
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,480
detection uh make sure make sure you

891
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,799
review it totally

892
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,240
and if it's applicable back to the

893
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,240
prioritization

894
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,919
is there any false positive in it or not

895
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,360
so you need to check that first

896
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,600
make effort to understand underlying

897
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
technologies there's a lot of free sim

898
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,719
trainings

899
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,960
splunk elastic a lot of free upset

900
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,559
and then when there's a detection need

901
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,279
some changes in infrastructure

902
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,600
it is better if you know what to change

903
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,279
than just asking infra team like hey can

904
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,158
you help us with this but we don't know

905
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,919
what to change

906
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,520
it's gonna be it's gonna and and that's

907
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,279
gonna take some times

908
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,279
but if you have exactly what you need to

909
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,279
change you can do it

910
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
and again automated testing of the

911
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,720
framework uh

912
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,159
you'll be able to verify if the

913
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,399
detection is working or not

914
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,360
all the time and you need to test the

915
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,639
whole pipeline again

916
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,080
from the source to the end all the way

917
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,159
to the ticketing so including the

918
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,600
pipeline to the seam to the data parsing

919
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,039
to the detection engine

920
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,879
every single thing inside you need to

921
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,480
know what's going on in there

922
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,760
and this is the only one thing that it's

923
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,200
good to assume

924
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,879
assume that your detection will be

925
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,960
bypassed with the attacker

926
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,120
because when you ran out of ideas just

927
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,320
making stuff up you know like what if

928
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,199
uh this happened imagine if that

929
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,840
happened

930
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,760
so also you can easily get those ideas

931
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,320
from the industry you go

932
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,720
to conference presentation specifically

933
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,720
red team presentation how they bypass mc

934
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,000
is there new ways you can learn from

935
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,480
there uh

936
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
check new tools like is is it like crack

937
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
map is like new version out

938
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
is it the bloodhound version the newer

939
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,918
version out okay we gotta try that

940
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,880
etc twitter linkedin

941
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,480
websites medium every single place you

942
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,360
can find those information

943
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,200
you just need again persistent to do it

944
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,760
just like apt you need to be persistent

945
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,480
learning stuff

946
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,440
and as a closing

947
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,080
[Music]

948
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
again everybody knows i think trending

949
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
is not easy

950
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,039
it's known from my experience from

951
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,719
people i talk in the community so it's

952
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,440
community experience

953
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
and him is created to inform and also

954
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,000
help you about it if you are

955
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
in in there already uh so the five stage

956
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,039
just a reminder no hunters answers

957
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,120
question mark

958
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,320
confused hunters disconnected hunters

959
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,039
ignorant hunters

960
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,200
all same level but in my opinion the

961
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,600
last one is the worst one the -4 is the

962
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,440
worst one

963
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,158
and i made this pretty nice

964
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,440
diagram table just like a hunting

965
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,720
maturity model

966
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,919
so you can easily see which one is where

967
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,799
uh and what what level uh you're

968
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,480
currently in

969
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,279
and then what you can do outside yeah

970
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,399
you need to refer back to your slides

971
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,600
uh well yeah don't be don't be

972
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:52,158
like a big headed so utilize

973
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,158
everything out there especially hmm and

974
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,399
him

975
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,640
you you look for progress is to achieve

976
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,199
and you look also for mistakes to avoid

977
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,039
well it's always nice when you can

978
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
always learn from others experience you

979
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,760
don't have to

980
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,760
take the pain right so just some credits

uh visuals are taken from this site's

989
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,320
template from slightly.com uh

990
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,399
yeah that's pretty much the talk yeah my

991

twitter down there my linkedin my github

992
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,600
my team is actually doing some blog

993
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,159
posting

994
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,799
so if you like uh you're interested to

learn

996
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,840
uh what's up with our team what

997
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,200
detection you're building you can just

998
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,439
go there and check it

999
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,640
and yeah i'm thinking my term adult uh

1000
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,399
thank you for tuning in

1001
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,880
uh slides will be available on github

1002
00:33:50,399 --> 00:34:02,639
but also will be available on the sun's

1003
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:02,640
website so that's all thank you so much
