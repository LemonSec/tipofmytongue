mr bromley i believe you are up to

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,599
introduce our next speaker

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,480
i am and i am excited to introduce our

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,440
next speaker too

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
because we're about to talk about uh let

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,039
me be careful with my wording here

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
massive scale and uh i'm i'm pretty

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,840
excited to see

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
what uh pete's got lined up here for us

peter you are you there with us oh let's

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,120
zoom sand either one of the two

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,360
and uh pizza today to talk to us about

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,718
building a hunting program at global

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
scale and i'll make a mention that he's

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,440
a senior software engineer at microsoft

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,200
and i got to be honest

24
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,360
microsoft over the past couple of years

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,320
has reached scales that i just

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,600
quite frankly absolutely boggles my mind

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
when i think about some of the issues

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,000
you guys have to face and some of the

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,199
things you've got to deal with so

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
thanks for joining us today and with

31
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
that i'll let you go ahead and jump

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,039
right into it so we stay on time ladies

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,719
and gentlemen

34
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,280
mr p brian from microsoft take it away

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,400
pete cool thanks matt

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,240
so yeah today i'm going to talk to you

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
fairly briefly about something we've

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,479
been doing for the last

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
12 to 18 months which is creating a

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
hunting program

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,400
that our customers can use pretty much

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
any any customer anywhere in the world

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
and this has kind of a number of

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,280
challenges with it and

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,639
they're ones that i think that are

46
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,479
pretty much applicable to any

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
organization doing threat hunting

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
and trying to build a hunting program

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,119
and particularly anyone who's trying to

50
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,679
do it over

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,400
more than more than a single team or a

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,560
very small

53
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,680
group of people so the challenge that

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,479
we got set was effectively to share

55
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,079
microsoft

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,560
hunting knowledge and expertise with our

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,158
customers within microsoft

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
my team the threat intelligence center

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,439
obviously does a lot of threat hunting

60
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
but there are numerous teams that do

61
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,639
different sort of hunting over

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
different data sets looking for

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,439
different things so we wanted to kind of

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
take all of that

65
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,798
and bring it bring it to our customers

66
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
uh then

67
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,239
obviously being a cloud provider it

68
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,038
needed to scale

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
and be pretty big it needed to work for

70
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,279
a range of our customers

71
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,640
so everyone from the kind of fortune 500

72
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,120
customers down to

73
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
the smaller smb teams that might just

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
have a very nascent hunting capability

75
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,559
and it needed to work across

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,319
all of their all of their data sets so

77
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,959
we didn't want it just to be a sort of

78
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,200
thing that worked only on

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,239
microsoft data only office ad things

80
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,399
like that

81
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
instead we wanted it to work with any

82
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
sort of data set

83
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
and this was primarily built for our

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
cloud sim platform

85
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,519
um which ideally can take any sort of

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
data but

87
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,879
as i'll talk about in a little bit we've

88
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
built it out to support other

89
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,399
other data sets other sim providers as

90
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,239
well

91
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
and then the final thing is we wanted to

92
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,720
make it accessible to every analyst

93
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,879
so we didn't want to make this a kind of

94
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,159
high tier capability that only kind of

95
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,799
three or four teams in the world are

96
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,760
going to use

97
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
we wanted to elevate every security team

98
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,480
with this capability and help them

99
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
access threat hunting and leverage some

100
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,238
of these more advanced techniques

101
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
at a lower level and just generally

102
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
improve security of

103
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,159
everyone out there

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
so the first challenge we came across

105
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,239
was really that

106
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280
hunting isn't a technique per se it's a

107
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
process

108
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
a process made up of multiple techniques

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,679
and creating something for a technique

110
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,720
is quite

111
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
easy and quite well um

112
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,080
quite well defined if you look at

113
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,080
security tooling or even just

114
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
cloud services they're they're focused

115
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
on like here's a technique

116
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,360
uh so creating a something that worked

117
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,480
for a process was a

118
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,040
a little bit different for us um

119
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,518
and the way we thought about it was what

120
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
what

121
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
is out there that helps kind of build a

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,239
process and

123
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,480
groups of notebooks were the obvious

124
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,159
choice they've been gaining

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,679
gaining momentum in security the last

126
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,560
few years but

127
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
they're a really good kind of flexible

128
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,879
way

129
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,760
of setting a kind of process but without

130
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,679
forcing people to just do one thing they

131
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
give you the flexibility that you can

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
go and do other things you can edit them

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
you can add to them you can do what you

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
like with them

135
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
but whilst keeping this all within like

136
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
a single contained

137
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
element a kind of threat hunting element

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
and we really like that

139
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
and internal teams at microsoft had been

140
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,000
doing threat hunting and

141
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
instead of response stuff with notebooks

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,960
for quite a while

143
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,479
and we had a whole kind of bunch of

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,840
tools and processes around that

145
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,919
internally

146
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,758
so it kind of made sense to take take

147
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,320
that platform we're using internally and

148
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
share it

149
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,199
kind of out with our customers as well

150
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,280
um it also helped that we have a cloud

151
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,880
version of notebooks up in azure as well

152
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,479
so we already kind of had the ready-made

153
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,400
platform to work with

154
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
so for those of you who aren't familiar

155
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,638
with jupyter notebooks yet

156
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,759
what they are is basically a

157
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
browser-based code

158
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
execution and run you have in your

159
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
browser you have these cells that you

160
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
can

161
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
run code in and then see the output

162
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,719
below and you can change these

163
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,080
outputs into kind of building blocks

164
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,960
that build up to stuff

165
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
you can kind of add visualizations

166
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,159
anything that you can do

167
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
in the code you can pretty much do it

168
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,919
notebook and then you can also add

169
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,639
markdown cells to add documentation

170
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
stuff

171
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
and then you can save these out as kind

172
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
of um

173
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
records of the hunt you've done say with

174
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,560
all the steps you took and all the date

175
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,159
router which is

176
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,000
super useful for sharing and for um

177
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
showing what you did like if you want to

178
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
show an instant response team hey here's

179
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
a threat i found that you need to get

180
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
deal with

181
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
here's all of my workflow that i just

182
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,479
went through to get there

183
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
all the data you can look at it yourself

184
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,719
here's a notebook

185
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
um i would highly recommend go check

186
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
them out

187
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,559
if you you're not familiar with them

188
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
already um there is a bit of a barrier

189
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
to entry like you do need to know some

190
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
code

191
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
python is the most common one with

192
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
notebooks but they do support other

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
things as well

194
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,799
um you can even run powershell in some

195
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,199
of the azure notebook stuff now which is

196
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,199
pretty cool

197
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,240
so after we kind of got over that

198
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,400
initial challenge of hey

199
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,840
what do we do this on we kind of ran

200
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,880
into the problem of

201
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,960
notebooks are quite hard to share so

202
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,240
it's great for sharing once you've kind

203
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
of done the process

204
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,479
but they're not great for sharing kind

205
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
of like a templated process

206
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
like you can you can share them but

207
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,680
since you run them you edit them

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,280
you have issues versioning uh if you

209
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,880
if you run notebooks regularly what

210
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,719
you'll find is you end up with like 80

211
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,520
different versions of the same notebook

212
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
or with like new new updated new updated

213
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,159
v2

214
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,319
like my my list of notebooks is a mess

215
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,919
and then that created problems at scale

216
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,240
like what if we wanted to go back and

217
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,280
update one of these notebooks with a new

218
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,199
feature or just

219
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,758
updated for whatever data set we were

220
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,360
working on how do we share that out with

221
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,880
customers because we're going to have to

222
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,400
send them a new notebook but then how

223
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,360
will they know versions etc etc

224
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,359
so our solution with this was to take

225
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,479
all that code we put in notebooks

226
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,360
and take it out of notebooks and instead

227
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,800
move it to packages so we have a couple

228
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
of python libraries

229
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,639
that we created one called mystic pi

230
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,960
which is kind of like our

231
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,880
core repository of the tools that we use

232
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,198
for security analysis things to kind of

233
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,479
get your data handle authentication

234
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,960
basic visualization and that that's kind

235
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
of

236
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
applicable to pretty much anyone using

237
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,319
notebooks anywhere

238
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,080
um and then what we did we created

239
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,000
another library called uh

240
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,520
mystic notebooklets which my colleague

241
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,919
ian came up with

242
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,799
and these are really cool and what they

243
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
are is rather

244
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
kind of those individual techniques they

245
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,878
are

246
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,840
chunks of those techniques in a short

247
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
process

248
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,479
and these are short processes that

249
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,039
you'll come across time and again when

250
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
hunting

251
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,719
so for example um quite often when

252
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
you're hunting

253
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
you'll come across a host name that you

254
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
might want to know a little bit more

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,080
about

256
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
and what you'll do is you'll run some

257
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,599
code to kind of get a summary of that

258
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,120
that host for you now

259
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
typically what you do in notebooks is

260
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
you would end up copying and pasting

261
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,039
code from some other notebook you've

262
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
written into this one

263
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
so what we did is we just took those

264
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
blocks and put them into note booklets

265
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,159
so now again you can just call them in

266
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
one line which makes the notebook

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
that you're running in a lot easier to

268
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,399
use a lot cleaner to look at

269
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,919
but also it's now a central location so

270
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,919
we can update those notebooklets

271
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,199
in real time and basically each time you

272
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,799
pull down and you

273
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
package the library you get all of those

274
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,920
notebooks down for you

275
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
and then finally obviously we wanted to

276
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,000
distribute this stuff

277
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,000
so we stuck it all into github uh our

278
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,839
favorite place obviously

279
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
so that at least we've got some kind of

280
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,560
like central repository for these

281
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
notebooks

282
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,079
uh it's not ideal because as soon as

283
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,760
someone clones that repo you kind of

284
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,279
lose all of that but at least

285
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,200
it gives a central place where people

286
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
can go back and say hey we wanted that

287
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,399
threatening process

288
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
they created let's go get the latest and

289
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,120
greatest version

290
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
so challenge number one and two were

291
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,160
kind of the easy ones they're the

292
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,360
technology-based ones and really they're

293
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
they're probably the ones that you can

294
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
replicate most easily internally

295
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,160
if you start using notebooks like

296
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
creating your own library or finding a

297
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
library

298
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,160
that does what you need is relatively

299
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
straightforward having a local git

300
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,199
server with all your notebooks in again

301
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
pretty straightforward challenge three

302
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,000
is a bit trickier

303
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
and this basically comes down to the

304
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
fact that you can't write a hunting

305
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,120
hypothesis for other people

306
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,360
you can give them ideas you can suggest

307
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,800
areas they look at data sources things

308
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,200
to look for in it

309
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,920
but a hypothesis to be effective needs

310
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
to be

311
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,800
really targeted on an organization their

312
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,920
context their threat model

313
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,719
so in essence what we decided to do is

314
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,599
not write a hypothesis for them and not

315
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
focus on that

316
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
and instead what we did is focus on the

317
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
common areas that

318
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
apply in threat hunting regardless of

319
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,640
what your hypothesis is

320
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,439
so this uh kind of data flow diagram it

321
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
was a

322
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
threat hunting process diagram i found

323
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,439
from gartner which i thought kind of

324
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
covered what i was looking for quite

325
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,920
nicely i think

326
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,000
as ben mentioned in the last talk

327
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
everyone defines threat hunting slightly

328
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
differently

329
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
but this one i think this diagram kind

330
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,600
of covers broadly what i'm looking

331
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,719
to talk about and what we did is rather

332
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,680
than focus on

333
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
the the bits and orange the the kind of

334
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,479
create hypothesis or the output

335
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,519
we focused on those steps in blue the uh

336
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,760
the discovery

337
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,760
the identify the investigate those bits

338
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,120
that are repeated time and time again

339
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,360
and focused on building that now

340
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
you still obviously need that hypothesis

341
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,519
and really that's what we're

342
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
helping our customers to bring we're

343
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,000
providing that via

344
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,000
a non-technical means so like blogs and

345
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
training and documentation about ideas

346
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
for this

347
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,720
and we still want to work in this area

348
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
we're doing some other work about how we

349
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,760
can help kind of create hypothesis for

350
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,839
people

351
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,439
but really certainly for our initial

352
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,320
phase we've we've kind of left that to

353
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,079
the side really

354
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,399
focused on those those bits that people

355
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,120
are going to do time and again

356
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,800
this again helps for particularly more

357
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
advanced teams as well because it gives

358
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,680
them flexibility to bring their own

359
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
ideas

360
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
and to to do things slightly differently

361
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,319
because again one of the values of

362
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,040
threat hunting is

363
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,560
the fact that you can be flexible you

364
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,439
follow your intuition you don't

365
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,239
necessarily just follow the prescribed

366
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
sock instant handling playbook say and

367
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,279
we didn't want to

368
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,040
create a process for people to use that

369
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
kind of broke that flexibility that

370
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
ingenuity

371
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,920
and by focusing on on those core kind of

372
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,319
modules

373
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,959
and by making uh the bits of the process

374
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
modular

375
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,719
we managed to retain that without kind

376
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,920
of guard railing people

377
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
uh too much to to a specific process or

378
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,240
answer

379
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,519
and so what we did is focus on those

380
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,399
things that you kind of use time and

381
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,959
time again

382
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,800
so one of the things that we really

383
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,719
liked internally and

384
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,199
a lot of teams used was the ability to

385
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,760
kind of timeline events to look at them

386
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
so we built a module um that is now part

387
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,399
of mystic pi

388
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,839
that creates these interactive timelines

389
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,920
for you and you can pass

390
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,079
any sort of data it can be discrete

391
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,199
events uh like logon events that we're

392
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,199
looking at here

393
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,839
it could be things like network traffic

394
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
over time that's

395
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,920
volumous uh and you can just easily and

396
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,560
quickly plod it on a graph with a with a

397
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
line for you

398
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
the same with uh things like anomaly

399
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,839
detection so

400
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
anomaly detection is a really powerful

401
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
ml capability

402
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
uh for threat hunting you can form a

403
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,240
really kind of good starting point

404
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,399
so rather than kind of create a anomaly

405
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
detection for a specific data set or a

406
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,760
specific environment

407
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,000
we created uh libraries on and features

408
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,519
that allowed you to um apply it to

409
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
multiple types of data

410
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,959
so my colleague karishma created this

411
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
anomalous sessions

412
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,599
um anomaly detection which can take any

413
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,360
sort of sessionized event

414
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,839
so it could be exchange powershell

415
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,120
commandlets which is this example is

416
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,760
built off but it could be

417
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,880
a syslog could be windows event log data

418
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,360
it could be anything where you've got

419
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
those

420
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,880
those sessions and those events and as

421
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,760
you can see

422
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
we love this timeline uh here we here

423
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
we're using it to

424
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,800
to visualize those anomalies um but

425
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,839
pretty much every single

426
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
notebook we create has has a timeline in

427
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,279
it

428
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
as well as some of the other kind of

429
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,839
common bits we created

430
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,399
so the fourth challenge came down to

431
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
barrier to entry and i alluded to this

432
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,839
earlier

433
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,440
notebooks require you to kind of have

434
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
some coding knowledge

435
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,720
and whilst that's kind of fine for a lot

436
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,599
of people

437
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
um particularly teams that are a bit

438
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,360
less

439
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,079
developed maybe have fewer people so a

440
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,279
narrower set of skills within their team

441
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,638
it is a bit of a barrier

442
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,560
and they can look quite daunting

443
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
particularly if you get a notebook

444
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,439
that's fully formed it's got loads of

445
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,440
code that you don't necessarily

446
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,920
understand

447
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,839
it can be a bit of a turn off for people

448
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,000
so what we did for that is to try and

449
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,480
make it as familiar as possible

450
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,279
so we created a lot of these interactive

451
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,639
widgets

452
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,480
in python that allow you to interact

453
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,839
with a notebook in the same way or at

454
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,199
least a similar way

455
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,800
you might with a ui in some other

456
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,359
security tools

457
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,040
so we can have things where you pick a

458
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
date time range with a slider and drop

459
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,000
downs

460
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
you enter the the host you're looking at

461
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
in this example in just a little text

462
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,959
box

463
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,880
and again this this is all just familiar

464
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,399
for people so it's a much easier on-ramp

465
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
for them

466
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
what we also found is by moving stuff to

467
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
the

468
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,360
the python libraries i mentioned earlier

469
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,639
we hide a lot of the code this makes the

470
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,639
notebooks a lot cleaner

471
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,399
and a bit less daunting for people when

472
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
they first approach them

473
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,920
and again because these notebooks are

474
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,760
flexible we can

475
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,439
share them in this way so people can

476
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,319
pick them up and use them

477
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,160
but a kind of a power user who's really

478
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
familiar with python say they can

479
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,839
just take out these sections and hard

480
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,160
code stuff they want in

481
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,240
um again the real power of having

482
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,680
notebooks as our core platform is that

483
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,600
that flexibility and that kind of

484
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,359
customizability depending on

485
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,959
on what skills you have

486
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,639
the other thing we obviously did as well

487
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,758
is kind of document this stuff

488
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,959
as much as possible through blogs

489
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,480
through documentation for the azure

490
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,040
sentinel sim products

491
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,040
and also the documentation for mystic

492
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,839
pie and mystique notebook clips are

493
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,279
our open source python libraries and

494
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,440
again we found that

495
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,199
whilst there's lots of great stuff out

496
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,800
there for

497
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,800
notebooks and lots of great stuff out

498
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,880
there for threat hunting

499
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,240
the the overlap of those two currently

500
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,399
at the moment is quite small

501
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
and is often quite kind of focused on

502
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
one particular

503
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,120
technique someone's used as part of a

504
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
threat so

505
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
we said we should just document as much

506
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,880
as possible about everything

507
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,319
to give people that on ramp and the

508
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,720
other thing we've done is

509
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,440
if you the bottom left and top right in

510
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,959
this um

511
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,839
slide excuse me they're they're the

512
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,518
starting

513
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,120
point or the opening cells of our

514
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
notebooks so

515
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,160
we put a lot of documentation into the

516
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
notebook itself

517
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,319
to talk people through what it's doing

518
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,639
how to use it what it means

519
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,920
um now we found not a lot of people

520
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
actually read that stuff

521
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,599
which can be quite frustrating but we

522
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
still think it's useful to have it there

523
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
for people

524
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,160
and hopefully over time people will kind

525
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,560
of realize the value of that a little

526
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
bit more

527
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
challenge five everyone's data is

528
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,079
different so again as i

529
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
mentioned before our challenge was to

530
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,438
create this kind of threat hunting

531
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
program that worked across

532
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,559
loads of different types of data not

533
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,678
just

534
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,199
windows data or azure data the thing is

535
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
everyone's date is a bit different

536
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,079
and even if it's the same they might

537
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
bring it in in slightly different ways

538
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,039
it might be passed or processed slightly

539
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,480
differently

540
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,280
so how do we deal with that now

541
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,200
a few people on my team have gone

542
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
through the process of creating passes

543
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,520
for things in the past and were

544
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
very adamant that we weren't going to do

545
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,760
that we weren't going to create a common

546
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,879
data

547
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,640
uh schema for people because this is the

548
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,520
world of pain it's hard to

549
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,360
hard to scale it's hard to keep updated

550
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,240
so instead what we did is focus on this

551
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,918
common data language

552
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,280
excuse me um and by that what i mean is

553
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,520
focusing on uh some small common schema

554
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,960
elements rather than

555
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,720
defining a whole schema and then having

556
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
a common interface for that

557
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,480
so we pick pandas data frames because

558
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,880
they're highly flexible and super usable

559
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,679
and what this allowed us to do is take

560
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,039
all of those

561
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,720
kind of features and techniques that

562
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,640
we're using in our notebooks and create

563
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
a common output and input of a data

564
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
frame

565
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,240
so using our library you can query data

566
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,960
from say splunk or

567
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,320
azure sentinel or other places it comes

568
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,480
back in a data frame

569
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,159
you want to visualize it in our timeline

570
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
while the input for the timeline is data

571
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
frame

572
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
so that kind of interface is done for

573
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,960
you and then

574
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,799
what we did is just focus on the bits of

575
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,679
common data that we need

576
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,440
so for example in the timeline if you

577
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,400
just want to display discrete events

578
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,080
effectively the only thing you need is

579
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,480
the time of the event

580
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,520
and the the kind of field that you want

581
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
to differentiate by

582
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
so the categorized field that you want

583
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,039
to maybe split events by

584
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,918
that doesn't mean you have to then

585
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,000
define a in your scheme or a kind of a

586
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,960
hard code a field for each one instead

587
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,679
when you call the

588
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,640
timeline you pass it the data frame and

589
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
you say

590
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,240
this column name is your time this

591
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,760
column name is your category

592
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
and the timeline just built it out for

593
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,799
you and that's been

594
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,000
really really useful for us it makes it

595
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
super flexible

596
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,960
super easy new data set all you need to

597
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,399
know is is two elements of that data set

598
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,120
off you go and again

599
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,000
because data frames are so so popular as

600
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,159
well

601
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,919
in the python ecosystem if you want to

602
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,000
plug in another data set

603
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,919
it's really easy to to get into a data

604
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
frame like you might want to load just a

605
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,000
local csv file

606
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
great pandas supports uh csv into data

607
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
frame

608
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,399
then you just pump it into the rest of

609
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,320
the tools

610
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,559
and that that common interface is

611
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,159
probably the the most useful thing that

612
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
we've done in in all of this process

613
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
uh the this challenge is kind of

614
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
interesting and again

615
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
the the last speaker alluded to this as

616
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
well in that

617
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
the definition of threat hunting is a

618
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,879
little bit different for everyone

619
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,320
so creating a a program or an output for

620
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
a program that suits everyone it is

621
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,520
going to be hard

622
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,280
so again what we did is focus on having

623
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,760
the common terminology

624
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,799
across everything we do so that people

625
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
know what

626
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,158
an output is an input is keep it keep it

627
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
defined

628
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,520
and secondly was by keeping it in

629
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,600
notebooks we can

630
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,639
show what we've done this isn't a black

631
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,760
box

632
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
find me something this is a step-by-step

633
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,080
process where you can show

634
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,440
each stage what you've done and people

635
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,158
can look back and see

636
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,520
see the process we've done and validate

637
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,440
our output

638
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,280
we also make the notebooks as

639
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
interactive as possible allowing people

640
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,678
to go down kind of different paths and

641
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,280
pivots

642
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,799
depending on what they're looking for

643
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
from the threat

644
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,559
and again to keep it accessible to

645
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,158
everyone we have kind of default values

646
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,639
so if you just want to go through our

647
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
process

648
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,480
and see what we we find with what we put

649
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,640
together that's fine

650
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,400
but if you're a bit more experienced

651
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,799
you've got that flexibility to do your

652
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,799
own thing

653
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,719
so in summary kind of what what can you

654
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,799
learn

655
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,360
from our process and the journey we've

656
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,520
been on for your own hunting program

657
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,439
well the first thing i'll say is focus

658
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,120
on the the journey of hunting and not

659
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,120
the output

660
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,799
don't think about what you want your

661
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,399
threat hunters to find

662
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
focus on how you want your threat

663
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
hunters to work and then build the

664
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,760
program

665
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,880
to fit that secondly keep it modular

666
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,520
don't don't um don't force

667
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,919
your hunters down to process allow them

668
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,158
to

669
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,360
to pick pick the process and build it

670
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
and keep it flexible because that's the

671
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,320
real value of hunting

672
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,639
um pick a common platform for them keep

673
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
it

674
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
familiar for them so as common to what

675
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,600
they they use elsewhere

676
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,879
and then think about the the sharing and

677
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,959
versioning bit early

678
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,799
so those first couple of slides where i

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
talked about how we shared notebooks and

680
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,480
creating the package

681
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,159
doing that early rather than at the end

682
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,880
is is going to be key

683
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
because otherwise you're you're going to

684
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,600
kind of create a world of problems for

685
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,760
yourself later later down the line

686
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,760
so that's everything from me uh that's a

687
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,360
very quick run through of everything but

688
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,960
obviously if you've got questions if

689
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,158
you've got time now but otherwise i'll

690
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:36,720
be in the slack channel for the next

691
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:36,720
half hour
