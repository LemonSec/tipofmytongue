1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,560
it's been a long time

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,040
in our community where i think ics or ot

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
or whatever we want to call it by

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,920
is kind of pushing the corner a bit or

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,679
oh that's that other stuff or is that

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,759
even a thing or that's an add-on to this

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,119
other thing and it's like dude the

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,600
enterprise is the add-on to the ics

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,880
and so it's just been wonderful over the

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
last 16 years to see our community grow

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,439
to become the community that it is where

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,880
we get thousands of people

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
lining up to to come to the conference

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
to share their insights

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,320
it's just really really beautiful and i

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,680
will i will say this as i

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,120
kick off there are plenty of still loud

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
voices in the community any given time

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
that don't peddle hope that talk more

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
about tearing down people and building

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,360
them up

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,680
and one of the things that always just

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
makes me so excited about the sands

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,960
community and the people that come to it

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,760
is these are folks time and time again

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
that'll go work the 12

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
to 15 hour shifts out in the substations

28
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
and real lines and similar

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
and still come and talk about hope and

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,000
growing the community and educating

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
going and talking to students and

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,119
similar so just be

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,400
that part of the community because

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,479
that's what makes it beautiful so

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,240
i'm gonna kind of click into the next

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,640
slide here um so for my keynote

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
i'm gonna be talking about the ics

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
security and review uh i'm gonna put on

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,040
my drago's hat

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,200
hold on uh especially just with the

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
background there we go

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,240
boom now i'm over at dragos all right so

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,159
the the beautiful thing about getting to

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,720
be at sands is is i get to be an

45
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
instructor and course author at sands

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
and i still get to

47
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,799
i do my company over at dragos with a

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,320
bunch of wonderful folks

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
um and so i'll do a proper introduction

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,079
now and kind of get into what this topic

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,799
is going to be

52
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,479
and kind of the lessons learned and the

53
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
data and why

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,759
um we do these kind of year in review

55
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
reports um so as i mentioned

56
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
in my sans capacity over as an

57
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,880
instructor and course author

58
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
uh in my dragos capacity i'm the ceo and

59
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
co-founder over there

60
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
we're a company that um has technology

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
for like monitoring and doing visibility

62
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
and detection in these ics environments

63
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,719
but one of the things that kind of makes

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
us particularly unique

65
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
is the way we think about making our

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
technology is about having really really

67
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,399
good people on staff

68
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
and those folks are going out doing

69
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
instant response engagements hunting

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,480
threats

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,959
uh architecture assessments with folks

72
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,480
we have an intel team that tracks those

73
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
threats and tries to understand what

74
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,480
they are

75
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
and and i you know when i started my

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,760
career i started

77
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
the national security agency side of the

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
house and built out the us government's

79
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
mission looking at industrial threats

80
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
and at that time it was a big question

81
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
of is that real

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,959
is there a real thing of threats that

83
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
are explicitly interested in ics or

84
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
developing capabilities or insights and

85
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,720
lessons learned like is that is that

86
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,440
real

87
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
and as we built that mission set it was

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
obvious that yes

89
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
there's a lot and the challenges we were

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,920
facing

91
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,560
was that we were always collecting in

92
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,239
the normal places that we were looking

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
for enterprise threats

94
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,959
and it wasn't until we started adapting

95
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,120
our collection getting into substation

96
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
networks and manufacturing lines and

97
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,280
similar

98
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,800
that we started collecting in the right

99
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
places to find uh those ics threats

100
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
and so to see the evolution of the

101
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,599
community for where i would say even up

102
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
until 2014

103
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
2013 or so like even the mention of

104
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,080
ics cyber attacks or uh hey

105
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,360
these things can take down

106
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519
infrastructure to be overly classified

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,080
in the government

108
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
side nowadays we're having broad

109
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
discussions with the community about

110
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
hey how how can we get ahead of these

111
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
things and let's not freak out

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
it's not about a phishing email it's

113
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
going to take down the power grid like

114
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,959
that's not how that works

115
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
but yeah let's stay ahead of this

116
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
because these are low frequency high

117
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
impact events and when you're talking

118
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,480
about things that can impact not only

119
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
reliability and operations with safety

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
it's worth paying attention to and

121
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,760
getting right so when

122
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,799
when i was coming into the ics security

123
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
community when i first started

124
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,599
everything was anecdotal it was somebody

125
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
spoke at a conference and said hey i

126
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
i got some secrets or i know a guy or i

127
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
saw some things

128
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
and it just wasn't too helpful uh in my

129
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,519
opinion

130
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
to really start understanding trends and

131
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
broader insights

132
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
and and how can we start getting ahead

133
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
of these problems instead of just

134
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
somebody's opinion um and so what we did

135
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,159
is starting to create these year in

136
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,680
review reports and then about four years

137
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,279
ago or four years ago is when we started

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:17,680
them

139
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
which was to say let's take all of our

140
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
insights that our services team our

141
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,639
intel team that we're seeing out in the

142
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,360
field

143
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,199
let's have a data driven view

144
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,440
non-marketing not pitching anything in

145
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
the reports just

146
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
here is what we're seeing from our

147
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
perspective

148
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
that's data driven on the community and

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
where the community is today

150
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,080
and and so it was really our attempt to

151
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
give back to the community these

152
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,040
insights and make them accessible to you

153
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,479
all so you can go draw your own

154
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,680
conclusions

155
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,880
and think about the problems that we

156
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
have and and again kind of invest

157
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
in our community and make sure that we

158
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
get this done correctly

159
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,840
so let's jump right into kind of the

160
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,479
broad

161
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,360
themes as we look back against 2020

162
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,880
these were some of the headlines you

163
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,759
would have seen

164
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
and some of the discussions that were

165
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,120
taking place this isn't the

166
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,880
incident response and inside you know

167
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,039
baseball kind of stuff this was all very

168
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,160
public

169
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
eckins started off the year where it was

170
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
the first time

171
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
that we saw ransomware explicitly take

172
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,160
an awareness for ics

173
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,639
you know computer processes and similar

174
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,680
and you know this is something i've

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,639
always

176
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,000
always talked about for a while now that

177
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
a lot of activity we see against

178
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
industrial sites is state driven

179
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,360
so adversaries that are state actors

180
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
targeting industrial systems and one of

181
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,960
the realities

182
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
of industrial is it's very political you

183
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,960
know going after

184
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,880
energy systems or manufacturing and

185
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,000
things like that it can be

186
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
you know going after critical

187
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
infrastructure is very state driven

188
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,039
either espionage or potential for

189
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720
conflict kind of scenarios and there's a

190
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
lot of value in that to states

191
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
but at the same time there are all these

192
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,880
cyber criminals and non-state actors and

193
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,759
similar

194
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
and one of the things that we've kind of

195
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
been watching is

196
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,680
when you look at the complexity of

197
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,479
really causing

198
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,800
impact in industrial it's not easy it's

199
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
easy to break in somewhere

200
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,759
there might be a lot of security

201
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,319
challenges but you can't take your it

202
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,080
mindset and look at the ics and go oh

203
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
there's a vulnerability in a windows 7

204
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
system therefore it's bad no

205
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
can you use that to cause impact you

206
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,199
know you have to look at that

207
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,240
very closely and and what we've what

208
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,479
we've

209
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
kind of been watching is that the level

210
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,319
of effort required to cause

211
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
impact and cause scalability is so high

212
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
that the investment required is for

213
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,240
states but what we're seeing now

214
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,919
in the community it's kind of you know

215
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,280
you can call it digital transformation

216
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,639
you can call it hyper connectivity we

217
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,800
start seeing common operating platforms

218
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
you start seeing more open standards and

219
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,639
a lot of this are driving a lot of value

220
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
but it's also lowering the barrier to

221
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
entry lowering that complexity

222
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,800
where non-state actors and criminals can

223
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
start taking a closer look at our

224
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,520
community

225
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
because there's scalability and

226
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,720
investment and return on investment they

227
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,599
can make

228
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,440
and i i don't want to get carried away a

229
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,199
data point is not a trend

230
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,360
but ekkins represents an interesting

231
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,319
data point

232
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,599
of an ics specific or ics aware

233
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,599
ransomware and wondering if we're going

234
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,440
to see more of that

235
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,639
throughout the year we also saw like

236
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
miter attack for ics release which i was

237
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,800
just

238
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
extraordinarily thrilled about again i

239
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
want to move away from anecdotal

240
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
stuff and i want to move more towards

241
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,800
what's the data

242
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,120
and there's a lot of value in saying

243
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
here's what we've learned from

244
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,199
attacks and intrusions before here are

245
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,199
the common tactics and techniques of our

246
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,080
adversaries

247
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
get off of chasing every single

248
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,520
indicator i want to know that this ip

249
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
address or that digital hash

250
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,599
that's not scalable it can be useful but

251
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,960
it's not scalable

252
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,919
getting into how are they operating you

253
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,680
know how are they achieving effect

254
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,000
what's the style of their attacks that's

255
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,199
very very useful

256
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
and it is scalable and it's something we

257
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
can take a close look at and have a

258
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,440
complain

259
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,520
excuse me a compendium of knowledge that

260
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
is driven off of exactly what the

261
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
threats have done

262
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
there's a lot of value in doing

263
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
consequence driven analysis

264
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
what is the art of the possible in our

265
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
industrial plants regardless of who or

266
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,599
what attacks it

267
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,680
what can be done there's a lot of value

268
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,879
in getting in there and looking at it

269
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,080
from that lens and a lot of good

270
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
engineering work going into that to

271
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
reduce some of the risk

272
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
of what's even possible in our

273
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,759
facilities but there's a lot of art of

274
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,560
possible

275
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
so to also know and pair it up with

276
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,400
what's the ground truth reality

277
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
what are the adversaries actually doing

278
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,599
not all 10

279
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,199
000 things they could do but what are

280
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,560
the 100 things they're actually

281
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,840
accomplishing and doing

282
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,120
there's also a lot of value in that to

283
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,360
help in things like prioritization

284
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,719
and again we started seeing lots and

285
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
lots of different ransomware effects

286
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
very targeted intrusions and

287
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
transmission system operators in europe

288
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,919
eckan started popping up again in

289
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
multiple facilities by may

290
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
the ripple 20 vulnerabilities got a lot

291
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
of conversations going

292
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,800
the i think the impact was lesser than

293
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,080
people realize it's very

294
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,680
hard to use the vulnerabilities in a

295
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,240
reliable way in industrial environments

296
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
however the point that it accentuated

297
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
was a good point that many have been

298
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
making in the community for a while

299
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
which is we don't really know what's in

300
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
a lot of our products

301
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,800
and you might see a vulnerability for

302
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
one vendor

303
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,240
but five other vendors may use the same

304
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
coding library or similar

305
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,120
where they all have the same

306
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
vulnerability but only that one issued

307
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
the advisory because that was the one

308
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
that got told

309
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
and so this topic of like software build

310
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,519
materials or s-bom or like what's in

311
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,920
our products is an incredibly important

312
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,519
topic that we'll just continue to hear

313
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,880
about in the supply chain security

314
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
discussions

315
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
um i was pretty sad to see adversaries

316
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,399
targeting pharmaceutical companies

317
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
during a global pandemic um

318
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,720
it it makes sense actually as much as we

319
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
want to yell about it it makes sense

320
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
that a state actor would try to steal

321
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
the recipe and the intellectual property

322
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,240
associated with new and emerging

323
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
vaccines

324
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,480
their own intelligence community

325
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,160
stealing things to help their people in

326
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,480
terms of manufacturing and copying that

327
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,839
you know we can get upset about that but

328
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
to some understanding that's what

329
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
intelligence services do i can

330
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,240
understand that

331
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
it was the adversaries that were looking

332
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,360
to potentially

333
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
target and disrupt those processes or

334
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
manipulate or use misinformation

335
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,440
to destroy the public confidence in the

336
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,200
vaccines those are the ones that were

337
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
just extraordinarily over the line that

338
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
we were seeing a lot of

339
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,839
and then we're just seeing a consistent

340
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,800
trend of just more and more

341
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,839
vulnerabilities

342
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
what i thought was particularly

343
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,920
interesting and this is

344
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
one that is something to watch is the

345
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,720
u.s treasury came out and sanctioned the

346
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
russian lab for the crisis malware

347
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,959
trice is also known as triton that was

348
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
the malicious software leveraged in

349
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,120
2017. it was the first ever cyber attack

350
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
to explicitly try to kill people

351
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
at a petrochemical facility in saudi

352
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
arabia and

353
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,480
what i enjoyed about that is it wasn't a

354
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
name and shame strategy to throw their

355
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
names up on a wild wild west post or

356
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,880
whatever it was an ofac

357
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
sanction from the treasury and from

358
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,839
those for those of you that aren't

359
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:48,720
familiar with

360
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
um the sanction process and ofac

361
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,560
sanctioned

362
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
from from the treasury it basically puts

363
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
you on the same level of isis

364
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
and it says you're dead internationally

365
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,440
like nobody's gonna do business with you

366
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
nobody can go and visit you nobody can

367
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,399
you know any banking sector that's

368
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
related to you hands off

369
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,480
it is an extraordinarily powerful

370
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,600
sanction and

371
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,120
and it was the first ever sanction that

372
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,959
we saw as a relate

373
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,200
as it relates to an ics attack and i

374
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
thought that was interesting and they

375
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
explicitly called out in the sanction

376
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,160
the fact that the reason they cared so

377
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
much was because it was ics

378
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
and because it was that targeting and

379
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
when we get national level buy-in

380
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
and amplification that there's something

381
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,480
special about ics

382
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
and maybe we shouldn't be targeting that

383
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,920
um that that's a great thing for our

384
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,640
community

385
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
and it's not going to solve the problems

386
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
it's not like adversaries you're like oh

387
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,079
okay

388
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,240
but it's the start of a dialogue between

389
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,760
states that i think is useful

390
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
and we'll talk some more about the

391
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,920
solarwinds stuff throughout the

392
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
conference and i'll mention uh

393
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,399
some points here today as well but but

394
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,920
we also saw

395
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,040
a large growth in threat activity

396
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,000
and and this gets so many different

397
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
opinions about threat intelligence and

398
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,959
threat activity and

399
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,560
and i try to keep it professional but i

400
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
will say it is always interesting

401
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,200
uh people's perspectives on what intel

402
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,399
is and isn't

403
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,839
and how many folks that have no

404
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,839
experience in intel at all or happy to

405
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,360
tell you everything about why intel is

406
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
wrong

407
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,519
and here's my perspective if you like

408
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,639
the idea of

409
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
learning from an attack or learning from

410
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
an intrusion and sharing those insights

411
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,279
that's all intel is

412
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
it's not magic secret sauce you should

413
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
absolutely do your security audits you

414
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
should absolutely invest in all the

415
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,839
other parts of the business before

416
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,880
you're going and

417
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,279
you know layering on intel but intel is

418
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,000
that kind of

419
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
secret sauce on top if you will at five

420
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
percent of

421
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,120
hey let's make sure the things we're

422
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
doing are right for where we want to go

423
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,519
and let's make sure that once we get to

424
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
a defensible place

425
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
that we're informing our defenders to

426
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,519
help move the defensible to a defendant

427
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,160
state

428
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
let's figure out how to incorporate

429
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,760
intelligence to understand those lessons

430
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,240
learned

431
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,760
it's not about taking a feed and rolling

432
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
it across your data it's about watching

433
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,720
trends and understanding

434
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,079
how you're going to prioritize your

435
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,040
limited investments and when we look at

436
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,320
ics threats how we think about it is not

437
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,279
just the threats

438
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
that are developing capabilities today

439
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
not just the ones that are taking down

440
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,560
you know power sector in ukraine or

441
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
similar

442
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,519
instead we look at it from any any

443
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,399
threat

444
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,279
that is explicitly targeting ics we want

445
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,720
to know the ones that are

446
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,560
hitting the enterprise right now but

447
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
they have engineering documents and

448
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
they're going after

449
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
just the accounts and people on the

450
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
operation side of the house

451
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
or when they get in they're stealing out

452
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,959
engineering drawings

453
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
and hmi screenshots and things like that

454
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,320
we want to know the adversaries that are

455
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
explicitly interested in them

456
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,399
so that we can help prioritize it for

457
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,600
the defenders

458
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
the goal isn't to say here's one macro

459
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,199
group that represents all threat

460
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,880
activity ever it's to say hey you've got

461
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,240
limited time and effort

462
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,760
if you care about these types of

463
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,519
problems here's an understanding

464
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
explicit to that

465
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
and as i mentioned kind of when you look

466
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,079
at the trend

467
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,800
in the threat landscape for years we

468
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
didn't have a lot of insights

469
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
and there was a lot of cases that dealt

470
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
with ics if you look back in 2010 and 11

471
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,320
the apt-1 reports that came out

472
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
fantastic reports looking at china

473
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,600
breaking into different sites around the

474
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,160
world

475
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
there was a lot of ics stuff in there

476
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
but not explicitly called ics

477
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
and the community wasn't at a place

478
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,600
culturally even

479
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,120
to be able to get into those industrial

480
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
environments and see anything but we

481
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,519
were seeing

482
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
intellectual property getting x-filled

483
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
out of manufacturing environments we

484
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,360
were seeing

485
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
engineering drawings and and scada work

486
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,959
getting pulled out so we knew it was

487
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,079
happening but we didn't have the

488
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
collection to say anything

489
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
and so what i normally tell people is

490
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
don't freak out about the threats it's

491
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,279
not oh my gosh everything's getting

492
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,760
worse

493
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
it's as we collect more we're seeing

494
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,040
more

495
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,480
and we're getting a better picture of

496
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,560
what's actually happening and what we're

497
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,720
seeing is some of those threats

498
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
are learning about ics and then

499
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,720
developing capabilities and doing

500
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
disruptive attacks

501
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
what we see is some are the early stages

502
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
of their learning

503
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
and we want to track their evolution but

504
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,880
maybe they will get to attacks maybe

505
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,760
they won't

506
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
and so you kind of follow that hurricane

507
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,880
path if you will

508
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,240
and one of the things that we highlight

509
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
in the report was that the threat

510
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,279
activity is growing

511
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
at a three sort of three times

512
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
um the rate of growth and what what that

513
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
would mean to us is

514
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
if we haven't seen a group in over a

515
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,639
year

516
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,560
any intrusions related to them we would

517
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
deprecate them saying hey

518
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,320
we we we're not tracking these these are

519
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
kind of inactive groups

520
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,279
but what we're looking for is how fast

521
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
are new groups appearing

522
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,920
versus how fast are groups deprecating

523
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,759
and we would hope for a one

524
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,000
ratio you'd accept kind of a one to nine

525
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
of like one new group comes in one group

526
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,800
drops off

527
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
what we're seeing is for every one group

528
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
that drops off three groups appear

529
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
that's not a great trend so it's

530
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
something to watch i'm not saying it's

531
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
alarming and all that it's just

532
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
showing that around the world more and

533
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
more state actors

534
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
and non-state actors now are becoming

535
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,519
interested and focused

536
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
and capable in ics at the same time that

537
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,839
our community is becoming more

538
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,079
hyper-connected and accessible

539
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,759
a lot of people talk about it ot

540
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,160
convergence i usually talk about kind of

541
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,680
that digital transformation with that

542
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,959
threat convergence

543
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
that's the intersection that i'm

544
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,720
watching that i think is interesting

545
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
that i think we need to stay ahead of

546
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,759
because a lot of the security efforts in

547
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,560
industrial

548
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,720
for big companies can take a three to

549
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,839
five year journey

550
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
and we're in a three to five year window

551
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,920
of hyper-connected common environments

552
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,240
with

553
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
adversaries developing their insights so

554
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
again not alarming

555
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,399
not freak out but hey we need to pay

556
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,600
attention to this and we need to get

557
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,360
ahead of it

558
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
um so as we dig into kind of what those

559
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
groups are

560
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,920
from this past year there was four that

561
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,079
we kind of i'm brought to

562
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
the discussion um one is actually one

563
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,079
you're probably already familiar with

564
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
um to some degree but we we sliced it up

565
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,240
a little bit more to be

566
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,600
um kind of the things that we thought

567
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,759
were interesting to ics so

568
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,680
fireeye track sand worm they do a

569
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
fantastic job in doing so

570
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,319
and san worm has been involved in a lot

571
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,359
of different activities you know

572
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,520
everything from ukraine 2015 to

573
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,079
the olympics in pyongyang in south korea

574
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,599
um but the uh reality

575
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,799
of um sandworm is it's

576
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
it's a definition i think a lot of

577
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
people look at these intel names as a

578
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,280
name

579
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,359
that's that team that's one-to-one ratio

580
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,319
with that team

581
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,160
you know these names are really

582
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,919
definitions and i don't know and you

583
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,600
don't know what the definition

584
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,640
to that team is of sandworm the ins and

585
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
outs of it

586
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,880
what you do know is that good people are

587
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
tracking a team and briefing you on

588
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,760
updates about what that activity is

589
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,400
doing

590
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
so as we looked at san worm and the

591
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,919
things that we were tracking related to

592
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,559
it

593
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,320
it hit a lot of ics stuff it had a lot

594
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,840
of non-ics stuff

595
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,400
as we started focusing just specifically

596
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
on the ics portions of it

597
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
um last year the us government and the

598
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,360
nsa actually came out and said hey

599
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
here's some interesting activity uh with

600
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
this xm campaign

601
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,280
relating like basically uh mail headers

602
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
and they said this is something we

603
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,799
attribute to the gru the russians

604
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
military sort of intelligence unit and

605
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
it overlaps very broadly with sand worm

606
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,080
and so we took a look at that

607
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
and it was something unique and it was

608
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,360
unique intrusions and it was unique data

609
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,320
it was a really good job

610
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,280
and from a government sharing

611
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,440
perspective and we were able to use that

612
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
data to then go find additional

613
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,520
intrusions and work with utilities

614
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
that we're seeing unique intrusions and

615
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,559
we were able to pull this together to

616
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,360
say look

617
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,559
it's not just like there's this one

618
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,720
broad sandworm team to us to others

619
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,520
that's fine

620
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,480
to us there's a lot of non-i.t stuff

621
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,200
there's a lot of i.t

622
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,679
stuff they focus on there's kind of the

623
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,360
actual team that develops malicious

624
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,280
capabilities like the develop the crash

625
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
override malware and ukraine 2016 that's

626
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,679
somebody we track as electrum but what

627
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,360
comma site is to us

628
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
is the team that's actually going and

629
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
breaking down the doors they're the

630
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,039
access team

631
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,440
they get in place and then someone else

632
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
comes in and moves in

633
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,039
and we and it's easy to think about gru

634
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,880
or russia and say that's them

635
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
but the reality is they have their own

636
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
development shops they have their own

637
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,039
allies they have

638
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,559
government labs that work with them et

639
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,039
cetera so this idea that one

640
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,120
threat name represents like one team

641
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
sitting in the basement somewhere is

642
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
always been off in my opinion

643
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,240
there's a whole supply chain that they

644
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
have hacker for hires

645
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,360
exploit developers lab researchers etc

646
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,760
the focus is how can you take the

647
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
intrusions and the activity

648
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
and focus it to a level the defenders

649
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,039
can use it not

650
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,480
look at me i'm an intel analyst i can

651
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
track all the cool things but how do you

652
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,880
piece it together of this is what you

653
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
mr utility care about this is what you

654
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
miss is manufacturing you care about

655
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,400
um that that's the stuff that we try to

656
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
do and with comma site was really

657
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,799
cool and interesting um to see the

658
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,720
access development team the team that

659
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
goes in before someone else comes in

660
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,679
so the main thing to focus on here is if

661
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,200
you were to see comma site related

662
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,919
activity

663
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,080
the takeaway is you can't just assume

664
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,159
that activity is related reconnaissance

665
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,159
this is one of the few teams that if you

666
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,559
see them you should be prioritizing the

667
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,320
detections and response efforts against

668
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,600
that type of activity

669
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
because they have demonstrated both the

670
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,039
capability and intent

671
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
to line up the team that then comes in

672
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,400
to do the destructive attacks

673
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,520
or i should say disruptive

674
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,720
skype night was another really

675
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,120
interesting one um this was interesting

676
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,240
for a couple of reasons

677
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
i'm not getting into attribution on this

678
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,600
don't really care to i don't think

679
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,960
that's the value

680
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
but i thought this was just a really

681
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
good work so cisco's talos team

682
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
identified the original poet rap malware

683
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
they did a fantastic job diving through

684
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,679
that

685
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,440
we took those insights kind of expanded

686
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,200
it out went and found a bunch of other

687
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
intrusions

688
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,320
and found some unique targeting and the

689
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
targeting that was particularly

690
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
interesting to watch here was that the

691
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,240
um the stipe night team is explicitly

692
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,960
targeting

693
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,799
wind generation resources and azure

694
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,880
jaiban we're not targeting anything else

695
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
that we can see from our collection

696
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
not going after anything else and the

697
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,679
interesting thing about that wind

698
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,840
generation capacity is there is no

699
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,840
operational wind generation capacity in

700
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
azure drive on nothing's up and running

701
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
there's multiple projects there's

702
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,400
multiple uh facilities getting built

703
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,159
but they don't have a wind generation

704
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,520
capability today

705
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
in izerjaiban they want one terribly bad

706
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,559
and they want one because as we

707
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,080
understand it they would love to not be

708
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
dependent on russian natural gas or

709
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,360
other fuel sources

710
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
and energy between states has always

711
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
been hyper competitive

712
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
and so for eiser jaiban to be able to be

713
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,080
more energy independent is a national

714
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,600
security goal for them

715
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,240
and styme knight is specifically going

716
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
after all of the companies involved in

717
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,480
that

718
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
the construction companies the the

719
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,919
companies making the wind turbines the

720
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,280
companies that are going to be operating

721
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,760
it

722
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,919
they're getting a foothold early on

723
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
before even the operational capacity

724
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,559
turns on

725
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,600
um in that country and either gibon

726
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,440
has had a really interesting year where

727
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,640
there's also

728
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
um you know darn near armed conflict

729
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,480
between them and armenia

730
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
and you've got you know i'm not going to

731
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,080
expound too much here but you've got

732
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
uh saudi arabian resources coming in to

733
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
support eiser javon

734
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
and helping build out energy assets

735
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
aizer jaiban has made

736
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
um sort of different trade agreements

737
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
with ukraine to provide

738
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
uh wind energy resources back and forth

739
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,039
between ukraine and then armenia has

740
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,840
more

741
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,000
sided with russia if you will and the

742
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,600
idea of having

743
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,679
energy dependence not being dependent on

744
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,880
russian fuel is

745
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
is an interesting geopolitical topic to

746
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,240
watch

747
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
so again i'm not trying to describe

748
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
attribution or saying anything like that

749
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,080
it's what what i think we're observing

750
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
here what i would assess we're observing

751
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,080
are the early stages of trying to get a

752
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
foothold in their energy entered

753
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,200
independence and that could have broad

754
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,559
strategic impacts

755
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,559
um for what's going on in eiser triban

756
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,919
now for all of you and the rest of the

757
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,880
world

758
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
i think it speaks more to a strategic

759
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,679
level it's not use these indicators and

760
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,039
go look for these things

761
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,200
but how are they doing that how are they

762
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,159
accomplishing it

763
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
how are they planning on their targeting

764
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,440
what are they looking for that's all

765
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
stuff that can absolutely be useful to

766
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,520
you

767
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
you may never have stype knight come

768
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
after you but if we can talk about the

769
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
tradecraft the ttps the tactics and

770
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
techniques that they leverage

771
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
this is stuff then that you can pick up

772
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,559
and defend yourself against any other

773
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,880
team that uses those same type of ttps

774
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,600
um so so all in all pretty useful there

775
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
another one that was interesting that

776
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
targeted a lot of japanese taiwanese and

777
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,559
us electric utilities

778
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,280
um was talonnite now a huge huge kudos

779
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,559
to the proofpoint team

780
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,000
um they picked up some of the initial

781
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,440
phishing emails going out in the

782
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
community and wrote a fantastic blog on

783
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,799
it that i put down there in the bottom

784
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,400
i had some really cool insights that

785
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
they developed and they'd actually

786
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,799
flagged

787
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,400
this email as well and we went and um

788
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,760
worked with the number utilities got

789
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,679
some additional information found some

790
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,039
additional intrusions pivot you know

791
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,159
went and found

792
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,240
this email loaded up in virustotal

793
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,000
pivoted it off of there found additional

794
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,440
intrusions and started making this

795
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,080
broader

796
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,000
view into the ics specific portion of it

797
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,320
now again it's not it's not saying these

798
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,520
folks are leveraging exploits and

799
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,880
vulnerabilities in ics

800
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,720
that's not the point it's saying this

801
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
group is explicitly

802
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
targeting utilities so it's not hitting

803
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
banks and other things

804
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,840
and the ways they're doing it is

805
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
explicitly going after the engineering

806
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
side of the house

807
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,840
even the theming of their phishing

808
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
emails and similar it's all about

809
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,559
getting to like

810
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
uh you know engineering surveyors and

811
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,480
their license renewals and anything they

812
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,279
can do

813
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
to get to the engineers and operators

814
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,039
that gives an

815
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,679
example and an assessment of motivation

816
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:31,600
on the adversary to be targeting in

817
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,679
the industrial side of the house and

818
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,720
therefore

819
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,640
as we care about that um it ends up

820
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,679
being something a little bit more

821
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
prioritized for us to go take a look at

822
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
again anybody working a utility or

823
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,559
manufacturer oil and gas company

824
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,080
etcetera you've got 10 000 things to

825
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,960
look at in a day

826
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,880
this is not about saying oh my gosh

827
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
we've discovered something that's going

828
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,360
to solve everything

829
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
it's about saying out of the 10 000

830
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
things you have here's three

831
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,320
that are really interesting on

832
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
industrial side of operations if that's

833
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,760
what's interesting to you

834
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,960
um and so the the focus there

835
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
and the consistency of this team to

836
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,240
target us utilities and try to get

837
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
access and they have had successful

838
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,520
access before and we've worked a number

839
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,039
of cases with their clients to

840
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,799
to make sure they can get ahead of any

841
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,360
sort of ics specific access

842
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,840
um those are a cause to watch this team

843
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,120
and to see how it evolves

844
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
and this could be a team that falls off

845
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
in a year and we learn some things we

846
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,600
share to the community

847
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,880
it could be a team that continues to

848
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,240
develop their insights over the next

849
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,960
couple years

850
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
so that's kind of again that hurricane

851
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
path i was talking about following

852
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
um another cool one that we saw was

853
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
vanadite um the

854
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,600
all the names we come up with by the way

855
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,120
are just made-up names it's all it's all

856
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,440
uh

857
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
industrial minerals everybody has their

858
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
own naming convention for us we just use

859
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,320
industrial minerals because we're not

860
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,760
trying to say like it's china it's

861
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,480
russia we're

862
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
we're trying to say here's something you

863
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,919
should focus on the the interesting

864
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:46,799
thing with this

865
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
group is the us government has already

866
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
come out and said this is related

867
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,799
has said that the broader context is

868
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,640
related to the chinese government

869
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
um so it's been interesting from their

870
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,400
attribution to say they care about it

871
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,039
what we saw and what we were able to

872
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,840
find

873
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,039
is that this group specifically is

874
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,840
targeting the

875
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
kind of the virtual private servers and

876
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
the remote access

877
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,080
into industrial sites and at first when

878
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,880
we saw this

879
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
and we saw a number of intrusions

880
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,520
targeting you know virtual private

881
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,799
servers and

882
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,200
uh kind of vulnerabilities that had come

883
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
out like one day before

884
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
against you know firewalls and remote

885
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,000
access points

886
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,679
and similar we didn't even know if it

887
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
was ics at first it was like well this

888
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
is interesting you could leverage this

889
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,320
to get ics but

890
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,240
i don't know that they are then we

891
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,520
started seeing the focus

892
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
picking up explicitly on those systems

893
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
that were related to

894
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,320
um infrastructure community especially

895
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,120
oil and gas

896
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
and manufacturing getting hit a lot we

897
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,159
started saying okay well if you're

898
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,520
hitting oil and gas and manufacturing

899
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,960
maybe there's kind of the the desire to

900
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
get into the operations environment

901
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
and then consistently with you know

902
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
feedback from our customers they were

903
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,880
seeing

904
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,440
um targeting of those remote appliances

905
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,799
that were explicitly

906
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,039
um the access points into industrial

907
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,840
systems

908
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,279
and this is a you know a good

909
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,120
observation for most people where

910
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
i think for years there was an

911
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,159
expectation

912
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,559
that ics was segmented and off the

913
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,880
internet or at least highly segmented or

914
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
you had to go through the enterprise to

915
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,840
get there so a lot of companies

916
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
prioritize their defenses and the

917
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,400
enterprise networks

918
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,159
made sense if you believed your stuff

919
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,760
was segmented and only could be accessed

920
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,960
from the enterprise

921
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,559
what we found time and time again over

922
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,960
the years is that actually integrators

923
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
original equipment manufacturers even

924
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
just the necessity of doing operations

925
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,039
in general

926
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,720
have set up lots of remote connections

927
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,480
and set up a lot of connectivity

928
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
and you don't have to go through the

929
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
enterprise to get there or you have to

930
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,640
go through somebody else's enterprise to

931
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,840
get there

932
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
and so these remote access points and

933
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
these um

934
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
capabilities to get in directly to the

935
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
ics by bypassing

936
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,840
all of those other systems is a lot of

937
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
value to the adversary and it's

938
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,080
definitely something you should be

939
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,360
prioritizing because we see

940
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
adversaries like van dyke explicitly

941
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,960
targeting those and getting access to

942
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,039
those systems

943
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,720
so when we look at the activity groups

944
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
we've already tracked you know this year

945
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,360
we focused a lot on kind of the new

946
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,000
folks

947
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,240
um the the existing groups out there

948
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,840
that we track are still active many of

949
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,640
them are

950
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,919
um we see them picking up you know

951
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,039
different vulnerabilities going off the

952
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,080
energy sector

953
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,679
um we see a lot of interesting water

954
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,200
hole

955
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
intrusions uh specifically themed on

956
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,679
like project and engineering sites and

957
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,559
integrators

958
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,640
see a lot of targeting of integrators to

959
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
get access to broad

960
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
sets of industrial environments um so

961
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,480
there's still a lot of activity going on

962
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,320
we're focusing on the new to educate on

963
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,960
the new um but i should note that

964
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,720
that many of those groups are still

965
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
active so make sure you're good with

966
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
those

967
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,799
um i think it's always a thing in our

968
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,080
community we're going to focus on kind

969
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,200
of what's the latest

970
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,399
even though we might not have actually

971
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,919
applied the lessons learned from the

972
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,120
last couple of years

973
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,720
there's still companies i know that

974
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,240
haven't applied you know instant

975
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,080
response plans for what a ukraine

976
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,279
scenario might look like

977
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,320
you know those are good places to start

978
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
um so then as we transition from the

979
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,200
threats and we start thinking about like

980
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
what's the true state of vulnerabilities

981
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,279
you know i i think the thing about

982
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,039
vulnerabilities that i find interesting

983
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,039
is if you're an i.t security coming into

984
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,399
ics security

985
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,520
and you look at the plant and its

986
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,679
operations right off the bat

987
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,200
you think oh wow these old

988
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,000
unpatched systems ah so many

989
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,279
vulnerabilities almost you wanna take a

990
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,559
shower right you walk in you're like

991
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
you're using windows xp still

992
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,120
what um and and i think that's really

993
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,080
not the point

994
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,840
and it's not a great way to approach the

995
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
industrial operations in

996
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,240
it security you're largely dealing with

997
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,799
system

998
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,039
and data security protect the system

999
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,480
protect the data

1000
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,799
in industrial control system security

1001
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,480
you're largely dealing with system of

1002
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,120
systems

1003
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,840
security sure i've got access to an hmi

1004
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,679
but what is that going to allow me to do

1005
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,520
uh in the environment how do i make the

1006
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,360
lights blink how do i you know

1007
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
cause an overpressure event how do i

1008
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,760
cause these systems to work together to

1009
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,279
do something

1010
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,360
additionally in enterprise you deal with

1011
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,559
a lot of high

1012
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,880
frequency low impact events a lot of

1013
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
stuff happening lots of scans lots of

1014
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,000
emails etc

1015
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,120
not too many of them are going to bring

1016
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,080
down your company in ics we deal with

1017
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,640
low frequency high impact events we see

1018
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,679
things less often

1019
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,360
but when we do it could be the

1020
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,720
fundamental like intellectual property

1021
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
that keeps your business in

1022
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,320
in uh as a business it can be safety

1023
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,440
related it could be operations and

1024
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,640
national security related

1025
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,679
they're big events so to me a focus

1026
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,080
an over focus on vulnerabilities is not

1027
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
the way to think about it it's more

1028
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
about

1029
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
uh how can i understand what's in my

1030
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,880
environment how can i get in a better

1031
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,399
security posture how can i start looking

1032
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,840
for the behaviors or the threats i care

1033
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,320
about

1034
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,679
how do i look for exploitation of the

1035
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
vulnerabilities i care about not just

1036
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:33,840
patching

1037
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,080
because patching isn't always accessible

1038
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,960
but that's not to say that

1039
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,720
vulnerabilities aren't important

1040
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,919
but when you look at the state of

1041
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,000
vulnerabilities it's pretty bad

1042
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,679
and so over the past four years we've

1043
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,880
been highlighting that the

1044
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
vulnerabilities

1045
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
are not the same value as they are in

1046
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,000
the enterprise because they often

1047
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
have errors they often lack a lot of

1048
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,360
context

1049
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,039
and many times the patches don't even

1050
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,960
actually fix the vulnerabilities

1051
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,240
and so we wanted to have real data to

1052
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
support that and so generally speaking

1053
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
we find most of the vulnerabilities are

1054
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,000
kind of deep within the ics

1055
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,880
network and control elements and similar

1056
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
those ones bordering the enterprise that

1057
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,039
give

1058
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,120
access to the ics are definitely a good

1059
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,159
place to start

1060
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,240
with your vulnerability patching inside

1061
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,840
the ics i want to get kind of east-west

1062
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
traffic analysis start understanding how

1063
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,880
things are communicating

1064
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,799
worry about native functionality because

1065
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,320
it's not about malware dropping in and

1066
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,039
doing something

1067
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
it's about an adversary abusing native

1068
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
functionality in those environments and

1069
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,679
how to do that

1070
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,919
but getting access is a big pouring

1071
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:30,799
point of the

1072
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,880
story so focus on the bordering the

1073
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
enterprise ones to start with

1074
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,880
then look at the impact your cvss the

1075
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
scores around these things are not gonna

1076
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,840
be the best way to view it from an

1077
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,360
operations perspective

1078
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,480
the the way to view it from an

1079
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,240
operations perspective is what can you

1080
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,000
do with this vulnerability

1081
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,519
we found in 2020 that

1082
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,480
36 of the vulnerabilities caused both a

1083
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,200
loss of view

1084
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,559
and a loss of control if you were to

1085
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,840
take advantage of them well that's a

1086
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
good place to start looking at those

1087
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,679
much more than the ones that didn't have

1088
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,480
loss of view or control the 62 percent

1089
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,559
so maybe about 62 of the vulnerabilities

1090
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,919
were kind of the bottom of the

1091
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,840
pile for you and then you should figure

1092
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
out if they really make sense for you

1093
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,120
we also found that the vulnerability

1094
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,279
data is just wrong time and time again

1095
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,600
in 2019 it was 30 but in 2020 43

1096
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,960
of the advisories that came out for

1097
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,640
vulnerabilities were wrong

1098
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
had the incorrect data either cvss was

1099
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,919
wrong the vulnerability was wrong

1100
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,519
sometimes it was the wrong software or

1101
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,080
hardware

1102
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,919
entirely and so the point i'm saying is

1103
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,320
not

1104
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
don't patch i know a couple of you are

1105
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,679
leaving this presentation going going to

1106
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,279
your security staff saying rob lee said

1107
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,399
don't patch no that's not what i'm

1108
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,039
saying

1109
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,880
what i'm saying is if you want to take a

1110
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,799
risk-based approach to patching

1111
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,200
the data needs massively cleaned up with

1112
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
a lot of context added to it because

1113
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,880
it's missing an ics where you might have

1114
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,240
it in the enterprise

1115
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
the last thing we want to be doing is

1116
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
bothering operation staff

1117
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,760
to go do something more than they're

1118
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,919
already doing on data that's wrong or

1119
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,000
irrelevant

1120
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
we also found that when it when it came

1121
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
to the advisories a lot of them were

1122
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,399
missing

1123
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,559
any sort of context or action and we

1124
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,279
found that 26 percent of advisories

1125
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,399
didn't have a patch when they were

1126
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,600
announced at all hey there's a

1127
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,799
vulnerability

1128
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
that sucks good luck that's not very

1129
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,880
awesome i mean it's good to tell us

1130
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,080
about the vulnerability so we can

1131
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,519
monitor or do something about it

1132
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,360
but if patching and segmentation is your

1133
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,200
main strategy

1134
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,559
you're obviously being left out in the

1135
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,240
cold a little bit

1136
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,519
we we further found that um you know

1137
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,919
kind of as we saw that evolution

1138
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,440
that 64 of the advisories

1139
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,399
had no practical mitigation advice you

1140
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,600
know and 61

1141
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,679
also had no alternative mitigation so it

1142
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,039
was basically patch

1143
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,440
or don't and there wasn't you know hey

1144
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,960
you can restrict this port or you can do

1145
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
these other actions and many of our

1146
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,519
industrial environments you just

1147
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,559
simply can't patch it's okay don't beat

1148
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,320
up your operator so the fact that

1149
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,399
patching has taken down more power sites

1150
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,559
than russia china and iran combined

1151
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,399
um so let's figure out how to do it

1152
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,080
correctly with the right data

1153
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,559
and then you know if we're going to

1154
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,279
patch

1155
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,679
make sure that we we plan it but if we

1156
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,640
can't patch

1157
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,879
have alternate guidance what else can we

1158
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
do what can we do at a firewall level to

1159
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,560
take care of ourselves

1160
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,040
and so the the way that we think about

1161
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,359
it is actually

1162
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,760
a standard developed over at cert cc

1163
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,359
where they look at it as a never next

1164
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
now forget the cvss

1165
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,359
forget the those other kind of contexts

1166
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,960
on the dragon's intel team what they do

1167
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,800
is they sit down they look at it from

1168
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
are there threats actively exploiting it

1169
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
is the vulnerability posing operational

1170
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,440
issues

1171
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,760
or is it wrong or is it not that useful

1172
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,359
or is the vulnerability just giving you

1173
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,719
native functionality

1174
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,480
features that are already present in the

1175
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,000
system you don't need a vulnerability to

1176
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
get the password that's already hard

1177
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
coded into it that doesn't make sense

1178
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
um and so we put everything into that

1179
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
kind of this never next now

1180
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,119
um and the idea of course is to take a

1181
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,879
lot of things off people's plate

1182
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,359
uh in 2020 30 of the vulnerabilities

1183
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,359
fell into a never category

1184
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,960
unless you were just flush with

1185
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
resources there's no reason to take a

1186
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
look at them

1187
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
63 fell into the next hey your next

1188
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,640
opportunity next time the plants down

1189
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,079
for maintenance next time you're in

1190
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:08,720
there

1191
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,119
take a look at these 63 percent only

1192
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
seven percent of vulnerabilities were

1193
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,040
worth

1194
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,720
causing a fit over saying like we really

1195
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,920
need to take advantage of this now

1196
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,680
threats are actively going after this

1197
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
or it has so much impact that we just

1198
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,880
really need to be aware of it

1199
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,079
and so getting into a state with

1200
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,760
vulnerabilities where you're a partner

1201
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,440
to operations

1202
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
and not coming in with your checklist

1203
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
saying why haven't you patched all of

1204
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,760
these things

1205
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,839
is going to be a thing that's culturally

1206
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,560
good but it's also backed by data of the

1207
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,160
right thing to do from a security

1208
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,839
perspective

1209
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
um and additionally like when we talk

1210
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
about the vulnerabilities again kind of

1211
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,760
as we

1212
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,240
we try to modify the vulnerabilities we

1213
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,320
look at taking those incorrect data

1214
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
and we look at trying to add additional

1215
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,320
context to it hey the cvss is wrong it's

1216
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,079
actually higher than you think because

1217
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,320
the way that we do it in ics here's a

1218
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,079
specific guidance on how to

1219
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,839
mitigate this or like block things to

1220
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,079
the port level here's context of the

1221
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,280
operational impact

1222
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
you know this is what we do this is not

1223
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
to say just go get our stuff

1224
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,240
this is to say this is what we do to

1225
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,079
help our clients this is the kind of

1226
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,760
stuff you should be doing as a security

1227
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,240
team

1228
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,119
if you're going to go help your

1229
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,520
operations staff i see too many security

1230
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
teams that throw a csv over the plant

1231
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,640
personnel that says

1232
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,839
here's a list of the vulnerabilities on

1233
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,040
the equipment go tell us if you haven't

1234
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,320
what you're doing about it

1235
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
you could provide a lot more value the

1236
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
operations by telling them hey here's

1237
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
the ones we actually care about

1238
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,920
here's the mitigations that you can take

1239
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,960
if you don't patch

1240
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
please let us know if you have this and

1241
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,079
if you need any help again it's all

1242
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,599
about collaboration and approaching them

1243
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,040
as partners

1244
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,119
from a engagement perspective and kind

1245
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,720
of instant response and assessments and

1246
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,000
red teaming and similar and what are

1247
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
what our team was doing out in the year

1248
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,800
um what we saw is that most companies

1249
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
have extremely limited visibility or

1250
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
collection or logging or insights in

1251
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
their ics

1252
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,599
and and there's a little bit of bias

1253
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,200
with this number where

1254
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,760
obviously clients that come to us to

1255
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,119
start their journey

1256
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,880
you wouldn't expect them to have done a

1257
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,400
ton of visibility things they often come

1258
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,040
to us for

1259
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
visibility and helping them understand

1260
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
what's going on

1261
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,839
and so from a security professional

1262
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,280
perspective this one might seem a little

1263
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,480
obvious

1264
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,160
but it's actually a very important stat

1265
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,760
outside the security practitioner

1266
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
community

1267
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
most of your ceos and board of directors

1268
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,599
have an expectation that a lot of things

1269
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,520
have happened in industrial security

1270
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,960
usually they think all the compliance

1271
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,560
work they've done is related to all the

1272
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,320
security work that should have been done

1273
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,839
or they think that they're just in a

1274
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,599
really good place anyways where

1275
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,079
most facilities out there have taken a

1276
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,280
patch and segment

1277
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,960
strategy that's their strategy and so

1278
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,839
showing the broader community outside of

1279
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,040
practitioners

1280
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,920
that actually broadly speaking you know

1281
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,720
in our

1282
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
cases in our collection 90 of the

1283
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,839
facilities 90

1284
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,760
of the customers we go into don't have

1285
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,440
any collection of visibility

1286
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,920
that is an eye-opening stat if you ever

1287
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,760
want to be good with resilience

1288
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,119
if you ever want to talk about instant

1289
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,520
response you need that visibility and

1290
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,079
collection

1291
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
up front we've we've done a number of

1292
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,440
instant response cases just the last two

1293
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,079
months

1294
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,839
where we're going and talking the client

1295
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,280
saying look you have no logging

1296
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,200
you have no data you have no sequence of

1297
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,599
event logs on the system you have no

1298
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
uh network monitoring you have nothing i

1299
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
don't know what you want us to do

1300
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,079
like you're such in a not good place

1301
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,359
that the best we can do

1302
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,839
is help make sure you're not still under

1303
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,560
attack

1304
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
uh or still going through an incident

1305
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,079
and you need to go and do all these

1306
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,680
different architectural invisibility

1307
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,119
kind of things

1308
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,119
we also see just again a lot of poor

1309
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,320
security perimeters

1310
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,640
that's not a stat to say you're doing a

1311
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,400
bad job that's a stat to say if your

1312
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,560
entire strategy is segmented

1313
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,880
uh that those segmentation strategies

1314
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,920
aren't solid

1315
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
and it's a poor strategy in my opinion

1316
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,920
um we also saw a nice increase where

1317
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,880
people

1318
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
last year 100 of the people that came to

1319
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,400
us that said that they had an air gap

1320
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:48,720
had

1321
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,800
multiple routable connections we have

1322
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,839
far less people

1323
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,440
after that stat went out claiming to

1324
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,839
have air gaps but we did find

1325
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,680
more segmented environments not

1326
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,599
necessarily truly air-gapped

1327
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,280
but as people are getting in there they

1328
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
are trying to put more focus on that

1329
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
and we also found that a hundred percent

1330
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,359
of our instant response um engagements

1331
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,680
had shared credentials from i t to ot

1332
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,720
often times in it active directory

1333
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,920
doing active directory and domain

1334
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,359
controller work in the operation side of

1335
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,160
the house

1336
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,880
and uh that is a highway of death that

1337
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,920
ransomware operator

1338
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,079
hit the it side go right to the plant

1339
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,320
side not not a great time

1340
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,880
so that's a good one to get ahead of the

1341
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,520
other thing

1342
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
as we start rolling down and i'll go

1343
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
over into the break just a little here

1344
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,920
um on the solar wind side we saw so many

1345
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,599
people call us saying hey don't activate

1346
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,000
the

1347
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
the instant response retainers we're

1348
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
good we don't have solar winds

1349
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,480
that like a day later would be like oh

1350
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,079
crap we have solar winds

1351
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,200
and what they were finding is that

1352
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,280
either plant personnel bought solarwinds

1353
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,400
and didn't tell them

1354
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,160
or they had it but they didn't have an

1355
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,440
accurate inventory

1356
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
or integrators and service providers

1357
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
were using it in their environments

1358
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,480
anyways

1359
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,960
or in some cases it was white labeled

1360
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,640
into vendor security stacks

1361
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,079
where they didn't say solarwinds in the

1362
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,079
box it said like you know vendor name

1363
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,599
security solution and it was actually

1364
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,800
solarwinds

1365
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,079
and the reality is if you looked for the

1366
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,240
technical indicators of the initial

1367
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,040
intrusion

1368
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,640
related to solarwinds it was compromised

1369
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,960
software if you look for the initial

1370
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,760
indicators

1371
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
and you had the logs and data it was

1372
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,599
really really simple to say hey we saw

1373
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:20,960
it but we didn't see any follow-on

1374
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,319
activity we're okay

1375
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,040
if you didn't have the logs and the data

1376
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,400
what was a simple like

1377
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,800
two hour check then was a you have no

1378
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,440
idea

1379
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,359
if there was external connections if you

1380
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,440
missed that initial data

1381
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,359
if they came in it was a tier one kind

1382
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,119
of top tier you know team

1383
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,200
they burrow in and you have very little

1384
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,359
chance of finding them unless you do

1385
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,599
extraordinarily deep skilled hunting in

1386
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,960
that environment

1387
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,880
and and what the public i don't think

1388
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,560
fully captured is there's a

1389
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
ton of industrial facilities that were

1390
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,760
compromised

1391
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,520
not had vulnerable software they were

1392
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,119
compromised because it was compromised

1393
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,000
software

1394
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,560
all across the world through things like

1395
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,440
maintenance links

1396
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
with the vendors as well as directly in

1397
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,880
their environments

1398
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,839
with none of that visibility and logging

1399
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,599
therefore most the community has no idea

1400
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,040
if there was follow-on activity in their

1401
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,760
ics

1402
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,240
or not that's not a great place to be in

1403
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,960
um

1404
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,319
it's okay to try to talk about

1405
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,079
prevention but everybody focuses on

1406
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,440
prevention how would we prevent the next

1407
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,640
one i don't care

1408
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,760
on the next one i don't care about

1409
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,599
preventing it what i care about is

1410
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,160
instead of

1411
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,400
having a multi-month or multi-year long

1412
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,680
process to try to figure out if we're

1413
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,480
screwed

1414
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,800
let's have a two-day process and with

1415
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,839
the right you know

1416
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,200
forensic capabilities the right

1417
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,480
monitoring the right visibility et

1418
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,280
cetera

1419
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,200
you can be more resilient by having a

1420
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,440
better detection and response strategy

1421
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
why we push detection response a lot

1422
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,119
because we've over focused historically

1423
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:41,920
on prevention

1424
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,960
and prevention eventually fails another

1425
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
interesting one is that

1426
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,640
a number of teams felt very confident in

1427
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
their ability to detect like a red team

1428
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,119
activity

1429
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,480
um what we found in 2020 is that 85

1430
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,640
of our clients um had completely

1431
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,560
ineffective abilities to detect

1432
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,119
the dragos red team on getting to their

1433
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,000
crown jewels

1434
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,440
so not just like we could break into the

1435
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,920
ics but like we could modify

1436
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
uh a safety system or we could actually

1437
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,680
get down into your uh

1438
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,200
most sensitive control elements and so

1439
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
that's not a shame on the security team

1440
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,400
that is a

1441
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,480
hey you may not have as effective

1442
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,839
detections as you think

1443
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,520
and when we do see people that roll out

1444
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,280
detection response strategies a lot of

1445
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,040
it is host-based logging or like a sim

1446
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,520
work

1447
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,280
and that's it's an okay place to start

1448
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,119
or it's an okay place to have

1449
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,480
but again you really want to get network

1450
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,640
telemetry to understand especially these

1451
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,760
systems that are largely

1452
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,760
not able to have endpoints and a lot

1453
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,200
with functionality and a system of

1454
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,319
system design

1455
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,640
where people are abusing native

1456
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,240
functionality more than they need new

1457
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,359
exploits or malware

1458
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,319
you want to be able to see how the

1459
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,160
systems behave and come together and so

1460
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,040
forth

1461
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
and so it's definitely an area for

1462
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,560
improvement because again i can't harp

1463
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,520
on it enough

1464
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
if your entire strategy is segment and

1465
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,160
patch or maybe deploy antivirus

1466
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,319
it's a very preventative focus strategy

1467
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,160
you need to also bring up your detection

1468
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,599
response

1469
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,960
i'm in a good case study of that this

1470
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,119
one was a really cool one um what we

1471
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:05,760
found

1472
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,560
is uh this was a locomotive i i gotta

1473
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,319
say that the rail industry

1474
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,640
just so many good folks i'm really

1475
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,400
stepping up to do a lot of good security

1476
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,119
work

1477
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,079
i think they've got an awesome

1478
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,480
opportunity to uh do some fantastic

1479
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,000
things in the community and bring their

1480
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,119
insights and share them i've seen the

1481
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,560
real industry move this past couple

1482
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,599
years more than

1483
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,400
last decade and what we found that we're

1484
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,359
able to do

1485
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:31,280
on a locomotive is actually modify

1486
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,319
the logic directly on controllers in

1487
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,440
such a way

1488
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
that when the engineering workstation

1489
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,280
plugs into it the controllers auto

1490
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,720
execute the code and the engineer

1491
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,800
workstation auto executes code

1492
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,359
and we were able to modify the logic in

1493
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,359
such a way that it propagated malicious

1494
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,040
logic automatically

1495
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,119
across the locomotive as engineer

1496
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,400
workstations were getting plugged in and

1497
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,280
similar

1498
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,359
and the propagation from an engineer

1499
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,119
workstation to controller

1500
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,280
of malicious logic is something you've

1501
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
probably heard about before there's a

1502
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,920
2010 case study on doing something very

1503
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,960
similar in a

1504
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,440
nuclear facility somewhere and being

1505
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,000
able to see

1506
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,079
that that same tactic on different

1507
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
systems in different ways in different

1508
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,440
industries is still effective

1509
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
um is a great place and to start and

1510
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,040
that's why i talk about like learning

1511
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,480
the lessons from intel

1512
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,400
it's not about i need an indicator and i

1513
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,079
need to know who's attacking my system

1514
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
it's no here's a viable attack path that

1515
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,280
we've seen before

1516
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,960
we're going to teach you about that you

1517
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,119
should go apply it to your systems

1518
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,200
too often i see companies go oh we're

1519
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
not in the nuclear sector

1520
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,560
and we don't use that vendor therefore

1521
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,440
we're good

1522
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,359
no does that tactic still work does that

1523
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,800
technique still work does it

1524
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,400
work apply to your systems and your

1525
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,079
environment take a look at it let's

1526
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,599
learn from each other let's learn from

1527
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,480
these attacks

1528
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,400
especially since it's low frequency high

1529
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,480
impact we can take a look at the things

1530
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,000
we see and really dig into them as case

1531
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,920
studies and stay on top of that so what

1532
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,319
an awesome opportunity to to go in and

1533
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,319
teach people different things and again

1534
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,079
to see whole industries kind of uh

1535
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,400
get ahead of it so as we boil this all

1536
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
down as i end my presentation

1537
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,560
and as we we get through all of our

1538
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,240
lessons learned throughout the year

1539
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,400
it boiled down to us for these top five

1540
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,440
recommendations

1541
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,200
you know i i like the 20 critical

1542
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,560
controls and things like that but i just

1543
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,599
think it's too much

1544
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,200
i i think the expectation that you need

1545
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,520
to do everything in your ics security

1546
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,720
portfolio that you're doing in your

1547
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
enterprise security is wrong there's

1548
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,160
four or five things that if you do well

1549
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,960
in industrial

1550
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
you've got a world-class industrial

1551
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,640
security program we don't need to copy

1552
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,440
and paste

1553
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,760
everything over most things aren't even

1554
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,599
effective to copy and paste over

1555
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,480
but increasing ot network visibility by

1556
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,119
far

1557
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,640
you can't see it can't protect it i know

1558
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,240
everyone says that but it's true but

1559
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,839
more importantly it's it's

1560
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,359
validate the prevention you think you

1561
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,280
have validate the segmentation you think

1562
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,000
you have

1563
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
understand and be able to get to a

1564
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,960
detection program to see the malicious

1565
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,400
behaviors in your environment what

1566
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,520
you're dealing with

1567
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,280
um there's so much value that comes from

1568
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,440
visibility seeing failing network cards

1569
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,480
and you know

1570
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,040
battery packs on plc's that are failing

1571
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,359
there's operations value in doing that

1572
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:00,720
um the second is identifying and

1573
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,200
prioritizing crown jewels you have a lot

1574
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,880
of stuff in your industrial environments

1575
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,760
you can't do

1576
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,680
everything and some things aren't worth

1577
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,599
every security effort that you're doing

1578
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,520
you know the wellhead that's generating

1579
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,640
a thousand dollars a day

1580
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,640
is not the same value as the refinery

1581
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,760
generating a thousand dollar

1582
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,560
a million dollars an hour and so figure

1583
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,800
out your assets that make most sense

1584
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,720
but then in those assets what are the

1585
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
crown jewels the safety system the

1586
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,680
engineer workstation

1587
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,520
the the system that i can modify the

1588
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,800
most control with

1589
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,319
the domain controller that happens to

1590
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,079
have access to everything figure out

1591
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,160
your crown jewels and start there

1592
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,359
definitely boost your instant response

1593
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,839
capabilities we find time and time again

1594
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,200
that companies think they have an

1595
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,800
instant response plan but there's like a

1596
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,520
paragraph

1597
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,680
for the ics inside the enterprise or

1598
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,880
it's something like call the plant

1599
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,599
manager

1600
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,800
and then the plant people are like who

1601
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,760
the hell are you and what are you

1602
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,800
calling us for

1603
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,920
um go figure out an ics specific part of

1604
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,520
that strategy and go train

1605
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,680
go get like a tabled up exercise go do a

1606
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,960
tabletop exercise on

1607
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,280
realistic injects with your operation

1608
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,800
staff and your security staff

1609
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,480
pound for pound best training and

1610
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,920
culture you know kind of bridge you can

1611
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,960
provide

1612
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,200
validate the network segmentation again

1613
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,640
i don't think network segmentation

1614
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,640
is the best strategy but most of you

1615
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,640
historically have depended on it so go

1616
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,520
validate it because

1617
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,520
we're finding that 80 plus percent of

1618
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,720
the time it's off

1619
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
so these are good stats to go to your

1620
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,319
your execs or others and say hey

1621
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,559
we're probably in the 80 percentile you

1622
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,920
know what the community is let's take a

1623
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,880
look at this

1624
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,880
and then lastly if you're able separate

1625
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,800
that it ot credential management

1626
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,559
uh specifically the adaptive directory

1627
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,240
stuff as well that's rough

1628
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,599
try to get ahead of that the best you

1629
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,319
can so i just want to say thank you all

1630
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,680
of the report and all the data

1631
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,000
associated with us at downdragons.com

1632
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,240
y ir so you're in review which like i

1633
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,839
said we try to make all this transparent

1634
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,119
and out to the community for you all to

1635
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:53,599
use appreciate you hanging in there
