2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,099
yes so first of all I want to give food

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,350
crops to Alec by the way so if you've

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,740
never looked into Alex's work I know he

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,119
spoke at quite a good detail but um like

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,919
it that is some of the most important

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,900
work being done in the community to

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,420
bring testability into what we're

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,310
accomplishing is there's so few people

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,830
if not maybe one of the only ones doing

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,870
it so I just really want to emphasize

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,899
how important that work is into the

13
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,120
future of what we're doing because most

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,680
of us like me fly by the seat of our

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,949
pants and if you think I've got it

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,480
figured out then you have a lot to learn

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,660
because I just make it up as I go just

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,339
like this presentation so the the thing

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,769
I want you to understand is that when I

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,199
joined Microsoft my mother said I

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,539
thought you hated them because probably

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,480
like everybody else in this room if

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,190
you're an InfoSec professional you know

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,128
you probably have a very very bad taste

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:10,048
in your mouth from many decades of some

26
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,720
very challenging events but I I want to

27
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,189
say that I walked into the company

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,840
three-and-a-half years ago no longer

29
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,979
with them they were very kind enough to

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
let me continue to give this

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,530
presentation one because I think it's

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,420
really important that this community at

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,650
least see the inner workings of

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,509
something like this and this is the

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,299
first and only time publicly this

36
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,079
presentation is going to be given but

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,450
that of how amazing the company is

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,798
actually and and I want to give you a

39
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,130
little bit of an insight on how this

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,400
works because unlike many places in the

41
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,259
world including inside DoD there's very

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,110
few places in the world where you can

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,840
literally change the world in InfoSec

44
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,890
because you know Microsoft has over a

45
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,100
billion customers and it I like you know

46
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,890
my my former general manager John

47
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,710
Lambert says Microsoft controls the

48
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,840
physics of the problem on most computers

49
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,969
in the world bad guys cannot do anything

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,520
except what Microsoft products allowed

51
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,739
them to do and so it's really powerful

52
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,260
to be in a company and literally change

53
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,870
the physics of InfoSec and it's

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,429
absolutely

55
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,260
the astounding and so I'll show you a

56
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,810
little bit of what that means so I

57
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,129
walked into Microsoft and and they're

58
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,709
like oh well so we're going to do this

59
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,030
thread Intel thing now here's first of

60
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,379
all to understand Microsoft's actually

61
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,450
been doing tried Intel for about 15

62
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,060
years they just don't really talk about

63
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,500
it like a lot of things inside of these

64
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,569
really big companies right Apple does

65
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,370
some amazing stuff and Google and Amazon

66
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,750
and stuff and but honestly like they

67
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,900
talk very little about it and there's

68
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:42,159
some good reasons for it but you know so

69
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,970
Microsoft had been doing threading tail

70
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,709
for a long time very very long time so

71
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,690
that they walked in because I had a lot

72
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,910
of experience product typing thread

73
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,910
Intel in the government meaning I

74
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,250
understood how customers meaning Intel

75
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,230
customers wanted intelligence and how we

76
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,680
needed to kind of improve how that

77
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,858
worked so they brought me in so I walk

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,260
in so how many here I work with a stock

79
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:10,470
raise your hands

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,269
cool I'm gonna here work with two socks

81
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,430
okay a few how many work with four or

82
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:20,620
more okay how many work with more than

83
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:25,030
12 so Microsoft has 12 over 12 socks

84
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,000
inside the company because each so while

85
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,160
we while most companies you think of IT

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,590
that's just one of many networks inside

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,079
Microsoft because every product is its

88
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,940
own production Network because Skype

89
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,709
does not run the same way as a sure does

90
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,970
not run the same way as Xbox does not

91
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,859
run the same way you know just keep

92
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,290
going down the lines they cannot operate

93
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,480
in the same way and the security teams

94
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,819
it would be ridiculous to think that a

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,679
single security team could effectively

96
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,768
manage the security for all of those

97
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,919
various domains and so while it sounds

98
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,660
absolutely ridiculous it actually makes

99
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,889
a lot of sense when you think of what

100
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,299
that what it would mean to actually

101
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,340
operate and manage security in those

102
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,500
domains so I walked in and they're like

103
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,480
oh so you're going to coordinate the

104
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,280
you're going to coordinate all of the

105
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,220
threats between all of these various

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,260
products and services so now I've got 12

107
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,500
stocks I have to effectively kind of

108
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,418
Corral and then as I get further into it

109
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,639
I don't even know if I'll get to slide

110
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:23,919
but as I get into it right the the

111
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,889
challenges oh and now we want you to

112
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,599
bring that intelligence that we

113
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:30,370
we get that we were able to produce from

114
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,930
our very unique telemetry in the world

115
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,550
we want you to push that out so that you

116
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,099
can protect customers not just our

117
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,560
company the one of the wonderful things

118
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:42,878
about Microsoft is that it lives a very

119
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,099
very wonderful philosophy which is first

120
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,419
of all that you should be secure just by

121
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:49,020
using two limits just by using

122
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:51,340
technology that security should be

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,960
transparent to you generally now they

124
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,460
don't always get it right but it's

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,698
something that they continuously try to

126
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,650
do so just by using office 365 you get a

127
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,539
whole bunch of really cool stuff in it

128
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,159
just by using as you get a whole bunch

129
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,199
of really cool stuff and it just happens

130
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:07,539
and it's completely transparent to the

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,699
users the other thing is that Microsoft

132
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:12,099
does not compete in the security space

133
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:13,599
it has some products but from a

134
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,878
protection perspective we have no

135
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,620
compete I work freely you know I worked

136
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:18,909
freely with Apple and Amazon and Google

137
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,099
and all the ones you would think that we

138
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,750
would hate we work really really close

139
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,430
together because guess what their users

140
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,740
are my users and my users are their

141
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,620
users and it's a bit the bad day for the

142
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,740
users it's a bad day for my users and so

143
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,110
we don't compete there we freely share a

144
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,270
lot of very very important and sensitive

145
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,000
things amongst each other to keep the

146
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,729
internet safe and it's amazing to be

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,199
part of that community and it honestly I

148
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:45,849
think that's one of the things that that

149
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,789
makes me I would say one of the very few

150
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:51,550
InfoSec optimists because I've seen big

151
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:58,688
things happen in amazing ways and I know

152
00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:00,189
that we can do this so the you know so I

153
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,180
can break what thread Intel is it might

154
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:04,080
so I want to give you a little insight

155
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,289
into how we do that and what that means

156
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,089
I don't think enough people talk about

157
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,469
by the way how they do their work it's I

158
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:12,789
think that's very rare and I think we

159
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:14,110
need to talk more about that I think we

160
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,568
saw a little bit about that from IMF

161
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,819
earlier so break down a couple of things

162
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:21,969
here for you so first of all data right

163
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:24,339
so you know I got to be a threat Intel

164
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:26,409
analyst for you know Microsoft actually

165
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,210
has a huge amount of payment processing

166
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,639
if you think about it so I get to do

167
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,779
some financial work Xbox is the largest

168
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,610
gaming network in the world so I got to

169
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:34,930
protect the gaming Network the large

170
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,029
void network in the world so I got to do

171
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,440
telephony you know second largest

172
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,520
consumer email service in the world so I

173
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,719
got to do consumer email large business

174
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,150
female servicemen also got to do

175
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,680
enterprise email second largest cloud in

176
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,500
the world so did cloud security I mean

177
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,470
it goes on and on and so you just you

178
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,590
look at the immense volume and variety

179
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,710
of telemetry from all of these sources

180
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,789
and there's really almost nothing

181
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,440
there's almost no bad thing that

182
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:06,110
Microsoft can't see and so it now it may

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,449
not see all of it but it's likely going

184
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,509
to have a part of that picture so you

185
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:17,210
think of all of this data right exabytes

186
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:19,310
of data like I it's weird it's like I

187
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,989
don't people used to work good data

188
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,220
unless you actually have a physics

189
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,770
problem I don't believe you have big

190
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,810
data because it Microsoft we have

191
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,609
physics problems right like we have so

192
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,349
much data we cannot even physically

193
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,039
write it fast enough or read it fast

194
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,750
enough and so when I talk about it we

195
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,568
were running security analytics on

196
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,849
petabytes and exabytes of data that's

197
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,919
data its security its security at

198
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,630
literally a global scale and then you do

199
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,099
it across all those all of the sites

200
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,870
globally so your security analytics are

201
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,190
running across you know data centers and

202
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,710
data lakes that are distributed around

203
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,509
the world so you have a lot of various

204
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,690
interesting problems to solve so you've

205
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,750
got to collect the normalizer data we

206
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:03,620
then do analytics now analytics is a

207
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,969
unicorn of a word so very clearly I'm

208
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,319
going to this is a very important point

209
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:09,680
in one of the important things about how

210
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:14,180
threat Intel has done at Microsoft we

211
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,759
consumed indicators of compromise only

212
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,860
because we had to because everyone would

213
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:25,099
think we were stupid if we didn't that's

214
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:26,840
literally the answer um but almost none

215
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,550
of those indicators were of any value to

216
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,068
us in fact they were of negative value

217
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,299
if you've read my blog post about what

218
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:38,060
the value of indicators bring instead

219
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:41,598
almost exclusively 100% of our tracking

220
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,549
our finding of bad guys and such all

221
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,890
came out of what we call behavioral

222
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:48,199
analytics and this is not some unicorn

223
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,670
these are very simple things and the

224
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,320
cool thing about analytics is that they

225
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,060
have what I've learned security

226
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,380
analytics have three properties and

227
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,229
they're very simple to understand

228
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,550
the first is transpose ability meaning

229
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,200
when you write an analytic you should be

230
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,910
able to transpose it across the various

231
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,410
data sets meaning if I'm getting hosts

232
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,209
telemetry from Linux I'm getting hosts

233
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,620
telemetry from Windows as many of those

234
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,000
analytics as possible should be able to

235
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,470
run equally across them

236
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,060
I should write I should have to minimize

237
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,220
the number of Linux analytics and

238
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,770
windows analytics I write if it's so if

239
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,330
it's a file right I don't care if it's

240
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:20,449
Windows or Linux it's a file right in an

241
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:21,770
operating system now I'm not saying that

242
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,170
that's going to work perfectly but you

243
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,030
can maximize that way another property

244
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:31,250
of really critical security analytics is

245
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,180
composability meaning if you are out

246
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,010
there and you're trying to write a

247
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,150
security analytic and you're frustrating

248
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,050
with you're frustrated with yourself

249
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,760
because you're getting bad false

250
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,020
positives or you know you're not getting

251
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,270
what you want it's probably because

252
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,560
you're doing it wrong and the reason is

253
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,350
is because you should be writing very

254
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,780
small atomic analytics that you chain

255
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,210
together into a composable analytic what

256
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,250
we would call ensembles that actually

257
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,870
gives you a huge amount of power and you

258
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,230
can compose them and you can reuse these

259
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,520
analytics the third property of really

260
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,290
good analytics or shareability

261
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,790
meaning if I write an analytic that runs

262
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,890
in the Xbox environment I can share that

263
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,900
analytic with Skype and so I can read it

264
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,280
in their environment now that's much

265
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,020
more of a unicorn problem I'm sharing

266
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,880
analytics is really hard because every

267
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,260
environments a little different but we

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,490
could do a little bit of it and that's

269
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,880
that's definitely an area for

270
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:21,920
improvement so basically almost almost

271
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,750
all of the bad things we caught not

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,400
almost nothing out of indicators almost

273
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,350
exclusively out of these behaviors and

274
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,260
the cool thing is that I was adversarii

275
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,140
agnostic I didn't care if you know it

276
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,450
was Stuxnet or high net or you know

277
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,010
whatever high kid or whatever right it

278
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,780
was if it did something bad

279
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,060
that's all it that mattered to me so I

280
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:44,300
was not I was not focused on any one one

281
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,550
adversary and again this don't think of

282
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,890
it in terms of this is this is Microsoft

283
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,260
protecting itself all of these analytics

284
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,760
by the way apply to every customer in

285
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,800
the world

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,740
Microsoft is its own user of its own

287
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,079
products so to protect the corporation I

288
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,700
had to deploy these analytics inside our

289
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,500
products protecting everybody including

290
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,450
Microsoft at the same time because a

291
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,250
threat Tork our customers was a threat

292
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,000
to Microsoft and the threat to Microsoft

293
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,470
is a threat to our

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,060
summers so there was no distinction

295
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,590
between threats to our company and

296
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,660
threats to our users they were one in

297
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,760
the same that also brings the point

298
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:18,530
earlier Rob made which is a a property I

299
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,000
learned at Microsoft which is when you

300
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,949
are a service provider in a cloud

301
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,590
provider you have a very unique problem

302
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,870
in that every customer you onboard you

303
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:30,650
onboard their adversaries - we call it

304
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,480
bring your own adversary and so in that

305
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,390
case if you brought on a new major

306
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,310
customer in the world you know like a US

307
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,720
government agency everybody who was

308
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,469
targeting that agency is now targeting

309
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,750
you as well and so we we had hundreds

310
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:49,070
and hundreds of adversaries that we were

311
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,780
we were we were managing so this very

312
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,310
simple graph right shows that you know

313
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,990
data down at the bottom the data flows

314
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,369
up we collect it we normalize it that's

315
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,960
very very important if you're going to

316
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,360
do transpose analytics you have to

317
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,160
normalize your data if you're writing an

318
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,650
analytic for every type data type you

319
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,390
have it will destroy you and a company

320
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,640
of this scale you can't do it it's just

321
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,140
not feasible so you have to normalize

322
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,520
the data once you normalize it then you

323
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,020
can do some really really powerful

324
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:16,370
things that blue box at the bottom 90%

325
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,310
of your work should be spent there if

326
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,530
you're not spending 90% of your time

327
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,869
data data wrangling you're not doing

328
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:28,069
your job because the rest of its super

329
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,760
easy at that point there's no magic

330
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,860
beyond that really we have a so

331
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,390
Microsoft has also so I got in there and

332
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,640
there was a we started with a team of

333
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,100
about let's see was two of us and three

334
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,520
of us I'm a left I left behind a team of

335
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,470
35 full-time hunters and thread analysts

336
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,079
now we that did that team didn't include

337
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:49,370
anything but basically threat people

338
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,470
because Microsoft has hundreds of

339
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,700
malware reverse engineers and forensics

340
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,650
analysts and stuff like that so if we

341
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,870
needed additional support we could get

342
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,910
it from anywhere in the company and we

343
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,830
did it was it was very good we all the

344
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,170
security teams really work together so

345
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,540
in that case those were 35 dedicated

346
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,370
threat analysts effectively looking and

347
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,280
so our job as threat analysts were three

348
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,380
functions our job was to find and track

349
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,939
threats our job was to understand those

350
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,010
threats what's what is the scope and

351
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,860
scale of that threat to our customers

352
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,180
and then the third part was to develop

353
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,740
new analytics based on our knowledge

354
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,329
which is hey if you're seeing a bad guy

355
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,580
do something new and unique and we don't

356
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,530
have coverage then build a behavioral

357
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,460
detection for that so we can find any

358
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:33,350
adversary doing that and so here's just

359
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,940
another example I'll skip the I'll skip

360
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,790
over this quickly but you know we have

361
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:40,520
you know Microsoft we detonate I don't

362
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,829
know it is a large one hundred tens of

363
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,630
millions of malware samples a day

364
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,030
so our detonation simple systems you

365
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,770
know very very large and scalable very

366
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,300
expensive by the way to run detonation

367
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:54,410
and you know tens of millions a day but

368
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,270
so yeah you can see one we also brought

369
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,430
in threat feeds we spent you know a very

370
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,420
large amount of money looking for you

371
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,709
know looking to see what other people

372
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,959
can bring but on the sleeve here it's

373
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,300
very little most of the value we get is

374
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,760
by by getting it by using enrichment

375
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,170
sources not threat data we generally

376
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,520
could we could generally produce our own

377
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,250
threat data sufficiently and so the key

378
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,449
was one behavioral analytic eyes like I

379
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,860
said earlier if you're looking to write

380
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,380
that one analytic to rule them all

381
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,960
you're going to fail the key is to write

382
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,240
these in a very small way that you could

383
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,620
compose and you could apply across the

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,420
entire kill chain because again if

385
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,850
you're it's the analytics are the same

386
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,410
as defense and detection is the same as

387
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,660
defense and depth you have to detect in

388
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,760
depth too and so we apply analytics

389
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,860
across the entire face so yeah we might

390
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,420
miss it in the delivery right so oh

391
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,460
three six they might be you might go

392
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,650
through go through sixty five but we

393
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,210
might catch it when it hits the OS right

394
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,640
before you know either before

395
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,750
exploitation we may miss it there to it

396
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,300
we will have maybe have to catch it

397
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,650
installation right and but that's how

398
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,729
this works right if you think you're

399
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,410
going to you think you're going to

400
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,130
prevent everything then you know I have

401
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,250
a bridge to sell you

402
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,620
but you know and now you've recon right

403
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,500
so now Microsoft gets to leverage the as

404
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,910
we heard earlier LinkedIn for adversary

405
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,340
reconnaissance and then leverage that

406
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,079
telemetry and visibility into the entire

407
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,570
system the cool thing about this is you

408
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,240
get hurt immunity right a threat against

409
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,850
one of our customers that we'd that we

410
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,430
develop detection again applies to all

411
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,290
of our customers equally and so it's not

412
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,150
just everybody you know working in the

413
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,410
silo it's literally herd protection

414
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,819
across all of our customers so how are

415
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,069
the head like I said we have about a

416
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,220
team we had a team of a team of hunters

417
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,290
right

418
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,840
and so they were matrix to cross service

419
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,969
and threat so I'll talk briefly but you

420
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,440
know some Microsoft tracks let's see

421
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,600
when I left about 129 129 was the number

422
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,490
those are just targeted threats by the

423
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,630
way so that's what we didn't really call

424
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,580
them a PT's because I don't believe in

425
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,730
that word so they're basically targeted

426
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,560
threats that doesn't cover the hundreds

427
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,980
of researchers we had in the commodity

428
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,569
threat space so and we matrix our

429
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,160
analysts in two ways first across

430
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,680
services so certain analysts were

431
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,209
responsible for responding and managing

432
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,130
the security analytics and different

433
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,510
services and then they were also matrix

434
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,790
across threats

435
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,350
the cool thing about this is you

436
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,120
stretched your workload very well you

437
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,040
spread your capabilities analysts could

438
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,660
move around it decreased single point

439
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,760
failures of one analyst left you didn't

440
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,260
lose everything you had and it

441
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,030
integrates really really well with other

442
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,950
teams because the other teams could

443
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,050
literally join us on these effectively V

444
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,750
teams right so if oh three sixty five

445
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,490
really wanted to understand helium they

446
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,720
would their security engineers were

447
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,790
joining us on the V team and so they

448
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,740
would be literally working with us as we

449
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,209
were doing threat analysis and then they

450
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,100
would be able to learn that way so we

451
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,080
could easily onboard and off-board other

452
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,600
teams into this model so it worked out

453
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,410
very well to create a cohesive community

454
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,750
of security analyst within the company

455
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,459
we organized within Microsoft we

456
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,710
organized a targeted threat

457
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,760
using the diamond model which you can

458
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,480
read the paper about so I'm not going to

459
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,400
go into and we but we logically group

460
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,870
activity Microsoft does not do

461
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,060
attribution we don't care to our

462
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,560
customers it adds no value to them we

463
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,149
care about the malicious activity and

464
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,369
the malicious activity alone if it's bad

465
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,430
I don't care who you are

466
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:19,739
we're going to do something about it and

467
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,589
so we basically labeled activity groups

468
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,209
by the periodic table honestly that's

469
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:31,200
it's a six-month chore to find a good

470
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:34,050
naming scheme so so a couple of tools we

471
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,390
used inside Microsoft so obviously

472
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,649
you're not going to just like as much as

473
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,700
I love Splunk as a product to do you're

474
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,320
not going to just pick ups one can put

475
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,460
it in here when you're talking about

476
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,820
exabytes of data and so you we it is one

477
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,929
of those roll-your-own scenarios and so

478
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,009
we have massive day

479
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,990
Lake of securely as security telemetry

480
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:57,090
scuba is a what we call scuba pivot is

481
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,360
one of the tools we use that allows us

482
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:03,360
to select running run analytics test

483
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,709
indicator test analytics and check

484
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,590
output and stuff like that and track

485
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,749
threat we we built our own threat

486
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,249
intelligence management tool that's

487
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:12,720
because all the ones that exist now

488
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:15,840
we're pretty much non-existent when we

489
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,460
started on the other problem with that

490
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,809
is scale again when you talk about this

491
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,159
kind of scale of what you need threat

492
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:23,428
intelligence management becomes a very

493
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:25,289
challenging problem we also also of

494
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:28,369
course love to use the tool that runs

495
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,779
every security team in the world excel

496
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:33,689
it is the tool to rule them all right

497
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:36,029
every team in here uses it so if there's

498
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,570
one single unifying factor that's it

499
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:42,960
and we and so basically we built Excel

500
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:45,059
plug-ins for our sick for our security

501
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,700
analysts so of course you know we we can

502
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,799
do that but it works pretty well a

503
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,210
couple of examples right Platinum so

504
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:54,570
you've seen a little bit come out of

505
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,029
Microsoft right honestly it's very hard

506
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,820
to publish outside of Microsoft on

507
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,830
threats of course the company got bit

508
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:04,590
very very hard many years ago by bad

509
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,899
things and so the company is is

510
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,490
legitimately shy about about talking

511
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:11,299
about some of this stuff so in fact this

512
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:15,659
in this presentation was very difficult

513
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:19,139
so platinum a threat in the Southeast

514
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:21,149
Asia region active since 2009 lots of 0

515
00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:23,610
days this is a great example of what I

516
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:25,860
want to just one point I want to make we

517
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,418
talked a lot about some of the you know

518
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,330
so because first key another great

519
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,549
company was up here earlier talking

520
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,830
about some really cool things and we all

521
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:37,259
get inundated with the Bears and the

522
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,570
pandas and the cicadas or whatever

523
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:44,009
animal we're picking this week and the

524
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:46,139
the challenge though is that most of the

525
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:50,100
threats in the world from the targeted

526
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:52,049
threat space are regional not global the

527
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,610
only reason you're hearing about them is

528
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,070
because you're most of you are from the

529
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,279
US honestly and you have a significant

530
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:02,550
bias on but the majority of my customers

531
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,980
in Microsoft they don't those those

532
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:07,500
generally don't affect them there's more

533
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,600
regional threats to them doing more

534
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,850
damage then there are these massive

535
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,649
global threats and so when you talk

536
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,230
about oh it's you know

537
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,060
sérgio about Microsoft was tracking 129

538
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,580
threats there's actually my personal

539
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,679
estimate this is not Microsoft's number

540
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,129
so but I'm pretty confident in this

541
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,340
there were at least over 300 actively

542
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,880
operating in the world right now and you

543
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,679
won't see almost any of them and so in

544
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,780
that case this is an example of we're

545
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,820
working in a global company you have to

546
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,649
have a true global perspective meaning

547
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,149
yeah the Bears and the pandas are all

548
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,980
great but the majority of the work we

549
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,930
did were in these types of groups

550
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,060
because that's where the damage to most

551
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,890
of our customers was coming from so

552
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,480
whatever is hitting the news it's really

553
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:53,370
a significant amount of bias that you're

554
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,730
that you're receiving if you think that

555
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,919
that's where the biggest threats are and

556
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:02,160
so simply we would then we also produce

557
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,500
reporting and so our reporting is not

558
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,580
available publicly and the route there's

559
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,930
a good reason for that because we

560
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,270
honestly don't believe that pure Intel

561
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,160
reporting is of any value

562
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:14,010
broadly speaking so these reports are

563
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,660
only served up on detection so when

564
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,540
something is detected in your

565
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,340
environment through one of our products

566
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,170
then we then basically you get served in

567
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,179
the Lord to provide you context around

568
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,140
that alert so when something happens

569
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,950
you're like well what the heck was that

570
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,440
well we have it every single alert has

571
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,870
documentation and if we can tie it back

572
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,630
to a specific threat we have a report

573
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:39,419
for you on that so we have thousands of

574
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,490
Intel reports because we didn't believe

575
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,620
in delivering a single detection without

576
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,390
appropriate context so that the security

577
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,040
teams could make guess what the right

578
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,310
decision which is ultimately what we're

579
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,139
all here of doing and so these again

580
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,760
reports you won't find a Microsoft

581
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,160
threat Intel library right or things

582
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,940
like that because these are detection

583
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,680
this is detection context not for you

584
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,810
know you to read and put into PowerPoint

585
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,040
for your CEOs so that's threaten tell at

586
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,100
Microsoft in 20 minutes

587
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,100
you

588
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,429
