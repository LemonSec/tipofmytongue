1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,620
so like you said my name is Lincoln I'm

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,800
the threatening cell officer over at the

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,060
International Monetary Fund I bail it

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,980
out because sometimes when i say i am

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,229
asked people look at me like do you work

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,910
with me an impossible mission force my

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,470
my my then i come it's like oh yeah I'm

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,510
like two cubes down from eating honey

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,680
can I kick in the am and I just yeah I

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,349
didn't figure you guys would laugh at

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,940
that joke but ok so today we're going to

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,610
talk about location specific cyber risk

15
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,000
and the idea here what we're kind of

16
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,280
trying to convey is a threat Intel can

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,649
help an organization understand the risk

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
that its people and its offices space

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,640
that are outside of headquarters in

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,989
different countries and so that's what

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,700
we're hoping to convey throat the stock

22
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,099
and I'm joined by my partner of crime

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,289
John kempinski he and I work together

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,320
he's now a kimchi but he worked with me

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,649
back a year ago and I'd that been a year

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,480
ago yeah okay cool all right so uh so

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:08,520
today the agenda we're going to talk

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,439
about why access to cyber risks related

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,369
physical location and very briefly we're

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,798
going to talk about kind of the

31
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,799
methodology and threat assessment so Bob

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,549
the the framework criteria and and

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,350
methodology so so one of the important

34
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,880
things to be able to be able to notice

35
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,229
that as we've seen up here we're setting

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,658
up here as Lincoln and John so we don't

37
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,039
represent the views of kpmg IMF

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,939
executive order management so this was

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,220
just something that we've been working

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,100
on together for it for a long time and

41
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,810
so right now i'm at the IMF been there

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,298
for about a year and a half but before

43
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,790
that I was in the US Army for about ten

44
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,130
years doing military intelligence into

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,530
your traditional counterterrorism

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:52,259
counter insurgency go into cyber realm

47
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,420
so I was actually evolved over at the

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,850
imap4 about about three years i'm over

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,079
at kpmg now so i'm a director for their

50
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,089
federal fiber fiber program so got about

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,919
ten years or so of experience with and

52
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,899
within physical security as well as

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,619
cyber security with the litany of about

54
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,860
primarily in session

55
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,879
pedal safe so I think that one of the

56
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,159
important things that we need to be able

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,268
to start to think about that is linked

58
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,030
and I were we're kind of betting this

59
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:22,269
back and forth is that about we saw that

60
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,129
as our mission travelers and our and our

61
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,799
remote offices of people will go out

62
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,470
into the fields and so they would treat

63
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:31,209
this whole concept of fiscal risk very

64
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,829
differently so it's very different for

65
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,159
for a mission to be able to travel to

66
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:38,019
Sudan or or to Russia than Anna Kenda

67
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,410
and so from this and so they would take

68
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:42,970
different protection mechanisms in place

69
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,620
from a physical security inspection so

70
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,959
the idea is to be able to say okay can

71
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,049
be make that we overlay the the whole

72
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,209
concept of cyber risk on top of on top

73
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,829
of this concept people say if you travel

74
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,500
to Russia do you need to take additional

75
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,849
security precautions from a performance

76
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,530
type of perspective to make sure that

77
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,298
you're protected over there and so

78
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,040
before you say that hey you know if

79
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,260
you're connected isn't the connected

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,989
universe the same everywhere and so I

81
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,530
would say that you know for every for

82
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,419
every 100 things that you can do

83
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,209
remotely you can do 150 things locally

84
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,160
as a bad guy bad guy yeah I was that guy

85
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,049
and so and so that's not that's not

86
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,819
taking that's not taking away from the

87
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,709
from the from the from the remote access

88
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,750
possibilities associated with with with

89
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:28,900
compromise but that's just overlaying

90
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,849
the the closed access or the third party

91
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,400
or supply chain axis or the insider

92
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:36,608
access a potentially have yeah hey like

93
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,260
I jealous and that's the common a kind

94
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,090
of rebuttal to what we were proposing

95
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,590
now from normally for mighty people they

96
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,480
think like hey it's the internet I'm

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,470
connected you know here doesn't matter

98
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,238
if I'm connected here or if I'm

99
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,280
connected to Moscow in maputo a bad guy

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,690
can get at me and so what we're saying

101
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,209
is though there's actually where you are

102
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,220
in the world has a direct impact on the

103
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,730
level of threat and risk that you know

104
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,379
you you face yeah alright so again so

105
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,819
the examples of threats are kind of

106
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:04,480
going back over to what we just we just

107
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,858
said that that a close access opens up a

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,388
litany of possibilities from central

109
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,810
compromised from government in criminal

110
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:15,129
packages insiders apts so you have the

111
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,120
ability to to government surveillance

112
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,978
and

113
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,510
and potential lawful intercept for

114
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,840
criminals as a criminal enterprises

115
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,180
operate in certain locations of and

116
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,820
deploy certain TPP's that are that are

117
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,040
specifically as and so obviously weep

118
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:36,810
activist but you have a you have a

119
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,430
number of types of potential of a

120
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,800
protest that are popping up that are

121
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,630
very geographically based about that

122
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,790
that can also overlay with the with the

123
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,889
hacktivism and insiders as well as a PPS

124
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,750
that will target specific industries

125
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,419
that a better letter that our location

126
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,320
well in all these examples that we see

127
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,820
up here these are all examples of

128
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,000
especially in the the apt and government

129
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,460
criminal case of where it is different

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,680
outside of your headquarters so let's

131
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,729
say an archaic IMF which whatever

132
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,770
publishers started off with a sigh

133
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,050
apologize where we are headquartered in

134
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,609
DC but we are an international

135
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,150
organization so much like the UN were

136
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:19,260
made up of you know 189 member nations

137
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:22,750
and so as a result we've got offices in

138
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,260
over between like 120 130 countries so

139
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,080
where we have people full-time every day

140
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:32,979
well we also send teams to even more

141
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:36,039
methods 150 160 the country in any given

142
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,729
year and so the thought process behind

143
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,620
this whole methodology is all right

144
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,210
given these types of threat actors what

145
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,970
is the risk that they face when they're

146
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,260
traveling abroad and so I did want to

147
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,400
spend a ton of time on this slide like

148
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,919
it easy spanner now we're talking about

149
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,419
all these examples and more I figured

150
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,740
everyone in the room kind of can also

151
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,560
pull up the examples I really wanted to

152
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,000
focus on the methodology so as you saw

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,590
up there in a way that we have the

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,020
different categories some of your

155
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:06,010
probably thinking why are you breaking

156
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,490
out government from apt what's the kind

157
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,349
of one of the same so we do that forward

158
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,229
for both internal political reasons but

159
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:17,229
then also from just kind of being true

160
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:21,849
to analysis and then try to avoid bias

161
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:24,070
so from an attribution standpoint if I

162
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,480
internally to my organization say oh

163
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,950
yeah apt1 so that

164
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,580
chinese government 3 pla there hacking

165
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,200
this or you know AP 228 that's gr you

166
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,580
Russia to see no hacking this or

167
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,690
equation group SFA they're there hacking

168
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:41,270
this I am effectively accusing those

169
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,930
nations of hacking something which they

170
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,909
have not publicly acknowledged to so

171
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,020
what I found is that suppose I start

172
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,820
doing that I'm going to have the very

173
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,169
high level people in the IMF coming down

174
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,380
and me saying like hey what are you

175
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,180
doing is using our nation of packet I've

176
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,020
also as I talk with other organizations

177
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,280
especially ones that are global in scope

178
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,560
they have sorted doing the same thing

179
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,940
and so attribution for me with a way

180
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,880
that we do it from an apt standpoint

181
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,020
when i get a vendor report i will say

182
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,610
okay apt 1 this is in east asian

183
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,710
sophisticated attack group whose victim

184
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,020
ology suggest that they hacked in line

185
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:22,460
with chinese national security interest

186
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:26,090
which is analytically sound true keeps

187
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:28,460
me out of hot water good and it also

188
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,780
gives all of the incident responders and

189
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,180
in higher level management and not

190
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,010
enough information to go on while not

191
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,530
accusing them of being associated with

192
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,719
any member nation so that's the way that

193
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:42,169
we do it now from government and

194
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,210
communication laundering what we say is

195
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,800
that any time you were inside the

196
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,969
borders of that country so any time

197
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,500
you're physically inside the US or

198
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,030
physically inside Russia physically

199
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,910
inside Zimbabwe physically inside

200
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,880
Lebanon that country has the lawful

201
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,190
right to do some level of communication

202
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,040
monitoring in fact you can look on their

203
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,480
in their laws and see even you know in

204
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,730
Russia for example they have the storm

205
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,660
you know system in laws with the FSB as

206
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,030
the authority and mandate to have access

207
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,490
to all traffic that flow through their

208
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,869
isp so for me that's good to know

209
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,160
because then I can tell my people that

210
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,990
are going to Moscow hey just know any

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,990
unencrypted communications you have well

212
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,090
in country can be collected and maybe

213
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,970
process analyzed and then use for

214
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,349
intelligent that's good information for

215
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,510
them because then now they can know if

216
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,250
they you know what they say using

217
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,890
encrypted columns of what they say using

218
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,860
unencrypted columns and also from this

219
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,500
standpoint

220
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,969
we as in till professionals wonder know

221
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,640
what are the laws around encryption in

222
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,200
that country because then that it then

223
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,519
informs them what they can and can't

224
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,260
take in the country which affects their

225
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,260
mitigating and preventive control plan

226
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,300
so that's the difference for us as far

227
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,160
as looking at it from a apt standpoint

228
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,459
and looking at it from a government

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,670
compel modern communication cybercrime

230
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,649
this is a combination of commodity crime

231
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,910
where but then also the more organized

232
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,899
crime sophisticated criminal actors

233
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,189
hacktivists you know pretty

234
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:16,260
self-explanatory insiders we are

235
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,380
primarily focused on the disgruntled

236
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,209
employee use case there what we think

237
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,700
about you know government coercing

238
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:25,410
someone to be an insider we look at that

239
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,790
is still falling under government

240
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,010
communication monitoring or of an apt

241
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,740
does it it's an apt well you know that

242
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,450
has more age insider as an agent of

243
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,310
another one of those categories but you

244
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,470
might take this and tweak it to whatever

245
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,640
works for your organization and what's

246
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,870
also important over here is to make sure

247
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,699
that these category is not mutually

248
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,690
exclusive and you can have you can nappp

249
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,070
was also up insider cybercrime involves

250
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,930
a hacktivist and so on and so forth and

251
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,320
so this is just our best way to be able

252
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:54,329
to kind of bucket the the different ways

253
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,190
in which which which people would would

254
00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:00,060
essentially attacker company exactly

255
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:02,220
exactly and so like I said we were in

256
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,760
international organizations that though

257
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,339
we were based at a DC we are not in u.s.

258
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:09,959
organization so I I even though I'm an

259
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,209
American I have to be very careful not

260
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,180
to showing us bias or favouritism so

261
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:18,359
what we've done is build out this

262
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,189
methodology with the hope is that by

263
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,250
making a consistent standardized and

264
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,190
empirical we can really remove a lot of

265
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,899
that bias and try and measure all the

266
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,579
countries in the same way so we're

267
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,300
really going to go forward and talk

268
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:38,250
about that the overall model that we're

269
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:39,719
using is very very similar to the model

270
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,140
that our physical security brothers and

271
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,120
sisters use and in fact it is pulled

272
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,959
from the UN department of safety

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,050
security there their overall nutin

274
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,380
bottle for doing this

275
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:55,660
and so the first two layers there at the

276
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,970
bottom that's where that's where CT

277
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,589
eyelids and so the first thing that you

278
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,330
have to do is establish that situational

279
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:03,490
awareness now because that really sets

280
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,589
the foundation that is that provides you

281
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,540
as an analyst with the context that you

282
00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:08,769
need to understand the threats and

283
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,890
understand how you you as an

284
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:13,660
organization and your members fit into

285
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,730
the threat picture in that country

286
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,420
anyone that was in the military or

287
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:22,089
government EIC space with recognizes as

288
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,670
amazing so pretty standard but i want to

289
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:27,579
know as an analyst what is the political

290
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,430
economic and sociological situation in

291
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,540
that country from an infrastructure and

292
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,250
in Hazzard standpoint I want to

293
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,560
understand that to that effect

294
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,839
connectivity and then how reliable the

295
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,060
comms are in country I need to know a

296
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,790
whole list of what the security forces

297
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,500
or in country as well as what although

298
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,779
the threat actors and threat groups that

299
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,339
have that we know about that have been

300
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:52,750
in that country or targeted organization

301
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:55,410
like us in country so the next thing

302
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:58,270
that we do now that we have that broad

303
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,130
situational awareness that a foundation

304
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,569
now we start really looking at the

305
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,490
threats and we want to measure what is

306
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,440
that what is the level of threat in that

307
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,240
country and so again going back to those

308
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
categories of threat actors we do it by

309
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,589
assessing those five categories and so I

310
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,320
looked at what is the likelihood and

311
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,940
intent and then also another thing also

312
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
talked about Cyril you called inhibiting

313
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,800
context now what is the likelihood and

314
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,420
intent inhibiting context for each one

315
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,529
of those categories for the government

316
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,719
and country or monitor our

317
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:27,310
communications or for an apt to attack

318
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,649
our people in country or for a

319
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,520
hacktivist to distort to come after us

320
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:35,110
while we're in country so then we we

321
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,480
take that in the way that we have done

322
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,829
it in the background we basically listed

323
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,010
out what are the different indicators

324
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,930
that we the types of information that we

325
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,260
be looking for for each one of those

326
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,479
categories we then have a standard kind

327
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:52,029
of scoring language for both intent and

328
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,130
capability is an inhibiting context one

329
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,130
through five that allows us like I said

330
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,960
at the beginning to to really be

331
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,680
standardized and

332
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,210
you know empirical throughout the board

333
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,000
so we go we get the information together

334
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,000
we fill it in we score it and then then

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,450
we end up with our overall threat score

336
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,890
here you can see the love language for

337
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:19,740
the business is for activists and so one

338
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,480
for intent is the groups are calling for

339
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,000
change you know not overly specific

340
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,820
whereas a five would be groups call to

341
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,010
overthrow the current establishment for

342
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,170
capability an example for like two would

343
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,540
be their ability is limited to largely

344
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,880
ineffective DDoS attacks I guess

345
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,610
undefended websites and then a 5 might

346
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,130
be ability to gain unauthorized access

347
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,900
to specific individuals accounts or

348
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:45,060
devices so it kind of shows that range

349
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:50,040
and then the last thing we have there is

350
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,979
inhibiting contact so inhibiting context

351
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,349
is really interesting before I showed up

352
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,390
to the phone when I went at first saw it

353
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,720
I didn't like it but then it grew on me

354
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:05,100
over time so what this is is these are

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,080
factors that outside of my ability to

356
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,830
prevent or control these are the factors

357
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:14,600
that would cause an attacker to restrain

358
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:17,940
their intent to use their capability and

359
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,210
so a couple examples thereof hi

360
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,100
inhibiting context very sophisticated

361
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,500
law enforcement in country so a

362
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,700
hacktivist you know might have a lot of

363
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,590
intent to go and bring down government

364
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,950
websites they might have the ability to

365
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,570
do so but they might not do anything

366
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,180
because the government is really good at

367
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,470
tracking down whoever attacks our site

368
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,050
so that would be something that's not at

369
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,000
all connected to us but that causes the

370
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,240
attacker to back down what I found is

371
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,520
normally analysts will go and it lump

372
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,960
that in with intent and it kind of gets

373
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,380
messy and it's hard to really determine

374
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,360
what is the that true intent by breaking

375
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,420
this out you're a lot of your you're

376
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,620
allowing your animals that have a very

377
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:01,110
to be a lot more specific and a lot more

378
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,330
precise with our intent and also with

379
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:04,860
the factors in the environment and so it

380
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,010
so it's kind of inverted there you see

381
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,830
for intent capability a one is means low

382
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,410
in 10 or capability where

383
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,560
this one means very high inhibited

384
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,140
contact and then vice versa so 5 is high

385
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,150
in centen capability but it's low

386
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,300
inhibiting contact so the example there

387
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:25,250
is you know in a country there's no law

388
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,380
enforcement ability to track down or

389
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,330
there's no laws to prosecute any kind of

390
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:34,480
cyberattacks so there's really nothing

391
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:37,970
holding holding an attacker back so

392
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,290
there we go cool and so so once we have

393
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,730
this body of information so we have to

394
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,930
threadably the situational awareness a

395
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,830
threat assessments what we're going to

396
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,890
start doing is we're going to start to

397
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:48,110
fuse this data with with with with with

398
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,069
some organizational understanding and so

399
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,010
this is actually where it gets kind of

400
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:56,630
cool so I mean it's cool so I mean

401
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,230
you're moving you're moving again from

402
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,990
kind of like threat intelligence IOC's

403
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,430
about and into this realm of enterprise

404
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,230
risk management and so what you're

405
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,699
looking at you're saying OK from a from

406
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,520
a from a different data points

407
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,590
perspective you're saying this is this

408
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,240
is the information that that I know to

409
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,950
be critical to my business this is the

410
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,050
informations I know that I think the

411
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,520
attacker is going to be interested to be

412
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,560
able to potentially compromised whether

413
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,960
that's going to be email inboxes or or

414
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,930
file shares or or specific memoranda

415
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,060
presenting a a delegation out to a

416
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,099
certain country to be able to negotiate

417
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,439
a trade deal and so the information on

418
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,450
that laptop then becomes highly critical

419
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,760
and so to be able to do a question there

420
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,890
to be able to say okay as as these

421
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,060
people move out into the field what what

422
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,710
is the purpose of their mission again

423
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,170
you're going to protect somebody very

424
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:47,000
differently when you put when you send

425
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,829
somebody on vacation in Canada when you

426
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,020
versus when you when you send somebody

427
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,930
over to to another country to be able to

428
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:55,819
do a trade deal so so so you take that

429
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,859
piece of kind of the quote unquote crown

430
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,280
tools and so your organization needs to

431
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,900
be able to define that however they do

432
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,550
but then then you marry that up to also

433
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,470
with what are the current

434
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,448
vulnerabilities on your systems alright

435
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,060
so what are the what are the current

436
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:13,010
known known issues and known risks

437
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,069
associated with that remote office or

438
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,790
with that or with your patching scheme

439
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,099
and and so then you marry up the the

440
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,399
attacker

441
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:25,859
and the threat assessment with with this

442
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,449
quote unquote crown jewels and then with

443
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,830
with with a known vulnerability you say

444
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,169
okay well i know that when this

445
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,899
organization goes up and the delegation

446
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,490
goes out they're going to have they have

447
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,870
these cds or they have these

448
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,490
vulnerabilities they have these audit

449
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:40,860
findings they have these non compliance

450
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:43,730
and security baseline and the attackers

451
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:47,570
also used and they look for and they

452
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,620
actively attack these cds or they have a

453
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,870
and so from there what you do is your

454
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:56,280
going to put together about risk

455
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:58,860
scenarios so and I think kind of getting

456
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:02,039
back to what Chris was saying earlier

457
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,408
wholesalers this is the opportunity for

458
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,390
Intel to tell a story because what we're

459
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,190
doing for each one of those categories

460
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,730
of threat actors we come up with

461
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,260
multiple scenarios that help us their

462
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,820
organization to kind of brainstorm and

463
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,280
think all right what bad thing could

464
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,389
happen you see an example of one of them

465
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,740
were hacktivists targets our organism a

466
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,169
member of our organization and then

467
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,480
publicly discloses his personal email

468
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,760
account so again personal email account

469
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,970
this is not something that your normal

470
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,220
IT security department is thinking about

471
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,900
the like hey I found ours we turned by

472
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,480
the first through its professional email

473
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,370
but we have no control over again

474
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,840
private but if you know if you know that

475
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,090
the the TTP's of that of that

476
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,740
organization typically focus on boxing

477
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,580
then those those are going to be the

478
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,970
sinner is that you're going to be

479
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,139
focusing on primarily handsome and so

480
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,570
and so once you have these scenarios

481
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,130
it's really kind of its that point that

482
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,600
that you need to be able to rack in sac

483
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,150
alright because again not all scenarios

484
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,340
are created equal so you need to be able

485
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,780
to say okay again if everything is

486
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,939
already nothing's a priority be able to

487
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,889
figure out what you focus on first all

488
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,929
right so so then again you're marrying

489
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,130
up the likelihood in the impact of each

490
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,200
one of these scenarios so what is the

491
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,470
likelihood of a breach of this of this

492
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,169
of this and what is a potential impact

493
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,580
to the organization so for example the

494
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,549
last last use case we just talked about

495
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,199
worthy the doc scene of a of a public

496
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,400
official in a in a in a in another

497
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,530
country for the private email address

498
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,450
what is the what is the likelihood of

499
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,250
the spread actors internally to be able

500
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,500
to even be able to do that what is there

501
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,480
what

502
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,480
their capability inhibiting contents and

503
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,410
and and and what are the security

504
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,940
protocols that are put into place to be

505
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,980
able to protect that a private email

506
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,740
address and then what is the impact so

507
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,530
and so this is kind of where again so as

508
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,570
you look at the the heat map associated

509
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,040
be able to say okay I'm on the the upper

510
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,280
right hand corner these are the things

511
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:58,570
that we need to be able to address /

512
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,850
yeah and just like John was saying after

513
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,520
you go through you Ray down to all the

514
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,689
different the likelihood and the impact

515
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,610
for each one of the scenarios this is

516
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,290
what it looks like and you might be

517
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,659
wondering why are you starting with g

518
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,730
and going through j actually did ya sirf

519
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,840
well they're the reason we did that is

520
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:19,270
this is the exact same heat map that our

521
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,070
physical security department does when

522
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,230
they look at countries and evaluate the

523
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,090
physical security risk and the idea here

524
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,000
by making our methodology like this we

525
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:30,310
can take these scenarios over lay it on

526
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,750
the physical so this is the same

527
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,490
physical security heat map and try and

528
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:37,450
have a marriage of physical and cyber so

529
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,220
we haven't done that yet so we don't

530
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,710
know if it's going to be how well it'll

531
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,810
work but I'm trying to like build it in

532
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,930
such a way that it has the best chance

533
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:49,210
of and working it well get back to me

534
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,920
like a couple years ago it works and let

535
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,140
any idea is again going all the way back

536
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,180
over to our to our different steps of

537
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,000
pyramid of the reason why we're while we

538
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,080
took the the physical security

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,550
methodology of the UN is because it's

540
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,990
something that's used internally within

541
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,310
the organizational constructs so it's

542
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,080
easy for them to be able to understand

543
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,190
and so when you say hey it's the same

544
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,270
thing that our physical security guys

545
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,890
are doing but we're just putting a cyber

546
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,690
lens over this this is the same thing

547
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,770
that we're doing again so in so it

548
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,750
becomes easier for an organizational

549
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:19,810
ingestion of a perspective to be able to

550
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:21,040
say yes I all right how can we has we

551
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,169
make this happen house we got erection

552
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,210
Eliza's again so the idea is to be able

553
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,950
to you know focus on the upper

554
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,930
right-hand quadrant so that over there

555
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,510
you know the example of g 1 which is apt

556
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,640
so apt breach the organization email and

557
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,070
i can read this but the idea is to be

558
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:39,640
able to say let's let's find ways to be

559
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,960
able to address that one before I too so

560
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,490
not saying that I to is going to happen

561
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,290
both but from an organizational impact

562
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,420
perspective it's going to be negligible

563
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,200
and like liquid is going to be

564
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,020
unlikely and again when we look at the

565
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,030
overall risk level for the country we

566
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,010
judged that based on not on the average

567
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,680
we originally started doing that which

568
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,510
kind of into work and so we're putting

569
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,690
it as the highest gives us the most

570
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,890
chance for security I doing it that way

571
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,720
cool and so finally we get the

572
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,870
mitigating risk alright and so this

573
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,940
isn't a mean this is a mixture of both

574
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,459
people processes and technology and can

575
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,910
include about ways to be able to

576
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:24,000
mitigate the the vulnerability though or

577
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,740
the or the the risk of both within kind

578
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,180
of the security operations arena but

579
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,670
also within a business context as well

580
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:31,650
and so for example you know technology

581
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,840
can controls additional monitoring about

582
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,130
loaner laptop that check and wipe

583
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,740
devices you can also have you know

584
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,660
persistent VPN on if they if they hit a

585
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,090
certain geographic ations USB right the

586
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,920
lockers so and so on and so forth you

587
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,939
know process control so maybe there's

588
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,240
and one of the one of the big things

589
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,240
that we found as a benefit to what we're

590
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,010
doing this this engagement is is to be

591
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,120
able to do do briefings with people

592
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,280
before they went on mission travelers

593
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,320
and so they're like I had very targeted

594
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,030
awareness is what we do yeah yeah yeah

595
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,750
so if they had they had no idea that

596
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:05,820
there are a number of different security

597
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,990
tools and processes available to them to

598
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,590
make sure that they're since when they

599
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:12,330
travel abroad so and yeah and the thing

600
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,800
that I'd say to a lot of us thinks all

601
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:17,220
ok there's a threat we need to find a

602
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:18,510
technological solution for then but I

603
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,460
mean realistically we're going to that

604
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,730
country in many cases it's somebody else

605
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,980
in our organization or the risk isn't

606
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,330
something that we have a control over

607
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,120
whether we're going to accept it or not

608
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,500
that that's higher up that it said

609
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,629
someone on the business side and so what

610
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,880
this does this gives them the

611
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:38,940
information that they need to make a

612
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,880
sound risk-based decision they can say

613
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,040
hey maybe we're going to go to that

614
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,480
country but if you're going you're not

615
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,820
taking any sensitive information with

616
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,820
you maybe or you yeah you can go to that

617
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,290
country but you're only going to use the

618
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,689
secure technology you can't do anything

619
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:56,470
you know using on secured comment and no

620
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,760
matter how inconvenient it might make

621
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,250
or maybe they say you're just simply not

622
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,140
going to that country yeah and this can

623
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:04,419
also affect obviously procurement in

624
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,640
contracts as well so like for instance

625
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:08,320
if your organization is looking at

626
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,679
deploying next generation or firewalls

627
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,110
or SSL decryption or or or advanced

628
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,820
advanced security technology maybe maybe

629
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,530
the locations that pose a significant

630
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,549
rare higher risk to the organization the

631
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,960
places that you could get that you

632
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:25,299
deployed the technology first so like

633
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,100
John said we built a methodology on

634
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:30,010
about a year ago and we tested it out

635
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,379
off foreign countries and so we found

636
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,289
that it was successful enough in doing

637
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,710
descent we then use that information to

638
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:40,750
come up with briefings that we gave to

639
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,240
the three offices in those three

640
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,650
countries as well as the people that

641
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,740
travel to those countries in

642
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,750
organizations to separate groups and

643
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,100
what we found the way that we did we

644
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,919
told them here's what the threat is

645
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,990
here's what the overall risk is and then

646
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,270
here's what you can do about it we gave

647
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,250
them information about tools that we had

648
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,720
that they could use per superior calling

649
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,970
for secure emailing features file

650
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,400
sharing and what we found is a third of

651
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,130
the people that we briefed and no idea

652
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,140
that we had one or multiple of those

653
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,870
secure communication or secured

654
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,539
technology which was great because then

655
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,620
we saw the user adoption you'll rise and

656
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:19,658
then people being generally generally

657
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,520
more secure we also found that they were

658
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,590
much more security conscious because

659
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,900
this actually applied directly to them

660
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,789
and we found that they started like

661
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,799
reporting things back to him so instead

662
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:31,390
of them being liabilities out there they

663
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,639
were now careful and they were also now

664
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,400
sensors so I'm turning my liabilities

665
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:41,140
into assets so that was for me at least

666
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:44,260
was a big win so in closing I would say

667
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:47,980
that this methodology is very much a

668
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,000
work in progress like I said the kind of

669
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,530
sorted it out but we haven't been able

670
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,570
to kick the tires on every single

671
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,899
country and I don't know that the three

672
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,120
that we did or representative of all the

673
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,559
other countries that are out there we're

674
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,418
in the process right now it's kind of

675
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,750
setting a world wide base line so we can

676
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:07,500
in depth you know review every single

677
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,360
country and also

678
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,770
feel very I think we must I speak for

679
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,780
both us when I say this feel very

680
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,370
humbled being up here I feel like anyone

681
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,470
in this room is probably better suited

682
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:19,350
to figure this out than I am or we are

683
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:22,560
so your feedback your critiques are very

684
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,209
much welcome because right now I think

685
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,909
we're just scratching the surface on the

686
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,500
possibilities here I think there's so

687
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:29,630
much opportunity and you're John I was

688
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,700
talking about this last night but for

689
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:34,350
automation with with this I think

690
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,060
there's so much opportunity to bring in

691
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,840
other data sets and find ways to make

692
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,929
this a much more sound rigorous

693
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,240
bias-free way to evaluate the threats in

694
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:47,750
a given location yeah and so that

695
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,430
actually is a wrong I'll work with you

696
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:52,830
guys to do the right thing we have a a

697
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:56,100
Google Drive over share all the sites

698
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,470
that we use when we evaluate the threat

699
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,669
and some of like the other

700
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,890
questionnaires and some of the resources

701
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,620
and we'll try and put more up there as

702
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,660
well yeah so one of the other things be

703
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:09,030
able to so in terms of limitations of

704
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,160
this methodology so again so we started

705
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,080
at the very beginning to be able to try

706
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,510
to find some sort of empirical way to be

707
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,740
able to measure the specific risk but at

708
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:20,730
the end of the day I mean this is still

709
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,200
the EU it still is a possible to be able

710
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,690
to have observer bias be able to click

711
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,190
in and so you know if you're looking for

712
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,350
something cancers already probably

713
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,490
probably find up there and so you know

714
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,899
we'd be looking to the broader community

715
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,120
to be able to find different ways in

716
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,580
which we can find but what we can

717
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,590
quantitatively and qualitatively remove

718
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,149
some of that observer observer bias the

719
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,649
other limit also on this this point in

720
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,160
time is that it's also point in time

721
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,440
assessment so you know as a political

722
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,790
situations change within country the

723
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,740
risk score is also going to change

724
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,700
living country as well and so those are

725
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,810
things that we're trying to actively

726
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:57,140
addressable to event thank you very much

727
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,139
for your time

728
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:02,979
you

729
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,979
