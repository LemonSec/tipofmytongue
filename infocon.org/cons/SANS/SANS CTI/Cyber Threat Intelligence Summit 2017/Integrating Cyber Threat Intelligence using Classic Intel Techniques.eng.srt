00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,849
gentlemen good morning or good afternoon

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,310
at this point so we all familiar with

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,050
the adage of you're gonna write a book

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,490
never start off with it was a dark and

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,140
stormy night same thing with a cyber

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,209
security conference never start off with

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,140
how well do you know your networks like

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,480
we've been asked that question many

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,470
times we know the answers are there you

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,780
know so yes it's like asking yourself

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,610
what does your car look like to what

14
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,890
purpose does that serve can your car

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,620
tell you where the next pothole is going

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,450
to be can your car tell you who the

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,309
thief is is going to come in the night

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,700
and who and when they're gonna take your

19
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:51,209
car No so for networks is still the same

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,920
kind of concepts there can your network

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,180
tell you when you're going to be

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,149
attacked the answer is no the fact is do

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,789
we know the enemy the answer is we

24
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,070
probably do not know the enemy oh we

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,100
have to consider the fact that knowing a

26
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,229
piece of malware knowing a piece of a

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,240
technique to do a sequel injection that

28
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,240
is not knowing the adversary the

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,658
adversary has a face it has intent it

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,250
has purpose it seeks the objective

31
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,840
manages risk just as we would with our

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,759
networks to that end then you know we

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
need to look at how do we approach it

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,520
looking at that enemy we look at cyber

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,549
threat intelligence as that methodology

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,820
to take a more holistic picture of who

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:43,950
were who is coming at us and to act more

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:45,539
proactively to confront them cyber

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,860
threat intelligence as we'll discuss

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,600
throughout this briefing is you know it

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,479
gives you three main benefits the first

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,329
of that is to be able to proactively

43
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,320
anticipate your adversary their actions

44
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,259
their intent

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,869
it also looks at taking intelligence to

46
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,149
define requirements gaps find those gaps

47
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,000
to allow you to look at vulnerabilities

48
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,169
that may be coming down the road

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,750
additionally it also takes and puts

50
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,239
context to technical indicators

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,970
using open-source non-technical means in

52
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,710
an integrated approach so consider the

53
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,060
fact that you have this company that

54
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,250
you're going to market these brand new

55
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,840
shoes called step tech shoes it's going

56
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,830
to revolutionize Footwear around the

57
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,560
world your business intelligence begins

58
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,600
to focus on the market players you're

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,740
not worried about the Forever 21's or

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,660
now worried about the rubber major the

61
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,140
Wegmans because they have no relevance

62
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:44,040
to your business interests you seek to

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,369
understand what the intent and what the

64
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,040
efforts are of your competitors to use

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,680
as levers for your business

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,600
decision-makers to begin to develop

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,020
their risk management in order to

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,670
achieve business success at this point

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,500
then you're obviously going to deploy

70
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,510
some type of network enterprise this

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,550
network enterprise is going to be used

72
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:10,079
to support your business operations and

73
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:12,150
protect your critical data the the

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,980
problem though is once you hit the

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,330
network you instantly become a

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,090
participant in the global threat

77
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,209
environment which then begs the next

78
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,820
question in this environment how do I

79
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:26,840
protect myself how do I anticipate the

80
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,000
adversary what are they going to do next

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,650
looking at risk management you know this

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,810
will be the core function that you're

83
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,370
going to approach this with risk

84
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,299
management is the core function of every

85
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,489
business risk management enables a

86
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,610
decision-maker to achieve his or her

87
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,640
objectives for risk management you need

88
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,470
situational awareness situational

89
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,839
awareness of both the current and

90
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,940
projected states you're looking to

91
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,540
address the vulnerabilities of today and

92
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,130
think about those of tomorrow as well

93
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,220
effective situational awareness and risk

94
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:05,480
management require communication both

95
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,260
laterally between all business divisions

96
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,670
especially with your cyber threat

97
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,429
intelligence folks as well as your

98
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:14,309
network operators but also vertically

99
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,060
with the risk management and with the

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,060
decision makers

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,270
let's put this into practice what the

102
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,859
importance there is looking at the value

103
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,650
of cyberthreat intelligent will take the

104
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,550
example of a car so back in the day

105
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,049
before GPS and handheld devices our

106
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,289
vision was limited to the tactical

107
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,639
environment what was outside my windows

108
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:40,770
what threat do I see in the immediate

109
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,050
vicinity of my car very tactical

110
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,460
operationally you may have had a map or

111
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,199
for those of us old enough to remember

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,320
you may have had a triple a triptych

113
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,639
which could have also put out

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,750
indications of long enduring road

115
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,520
closure information but today we now

116
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,220
operate in a more strategic environment

117
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,159
with the continual receipt of

118
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,599
indications and warning from weather

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,750
from traffic from road closures you name

120
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,240
it which gives us the ability to plan

121
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,099
ahead and more proactively work around

122
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,160
any threats that might happen down the

123
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:22,260
road or impediments well in advance of

124
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,810
our current position CTI cyber threat

125
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,560
intelligence much like the GPS and the

126
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:31,440
handheld devices gives added value to

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,810
situational awareness it helps you to

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,210
look beyond the horizon look at the

129
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,250
adversary in their operational space to

130
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:43,770
hopefully understand their plans their

131
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:46,050
intent their capabilities create a

132
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,630
holistic picture that incorporates both

133
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:52,050
the tactical the operational and the

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:54,419
strategic pictures of intelligence in

135
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,030
order to give you timely accurate and

136
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:59,758
actionable intelligence information to

137
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:04,349
help you to proactively attack the

138
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,909
threats coming at you now one key

139
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:07,229
difference here is when we look at cyber

140
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:08,969
threat intelligence we're not just

141
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,130
focused on the persona part of me the

142
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,720
the logical areas we're also looking at

143
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,639
the persona layers we're also looking at

144
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,669
the physical layers and not necessarily

145
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,409
just directly within cyber itself there

146
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,299
could be other open-source pieces that

147
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:23,099
help build that picture

148
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,410
and when we talk about tactical

149
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,660
operational and strategic which will

150
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,790
address in more detail later the

151
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,400
definitions we use and proposed are

152
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,950
those that come from working definitions

153
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,849
and concepts inspired by the

154
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,310
intelligence National Security Alliance

155
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:42,570
enca as well as our experience within

156
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,140
the cyber domain working with DoD short

157
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,790
and sweet

158
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,599
tactical we're talking about the here

159
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,400
the now how do we stop the bleeding

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,060
what do we need to answer the question

161
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,000
right now

162
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,080
that's the triage phase essentially

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,800
operationally we're looking at short

164
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:02,130
term trends we're looking at actor

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,480
intent at the strategic level again

166
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,980
we're looking at the intent the

167
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,750
longer-term trends but we're also

168
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,300
looking at the implications of policy

169
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,890
changes the implications of technology

170
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,440
changes and the threats and the

171
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,300
opportunities themselves at the point

172
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,860
with those three levels of understanding

173
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,380
is to build your situational awareness

174
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,080
if you fail to go and develop

175
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:24,030
situational awareness what you end up

176
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,320
having is a tactical environment that

177
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,830
you will reign in which is largely

178
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,270
reactive by its nature yeah and because

179
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,460
of that that will deny you the

180
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,320
opportunities later to be able to a

181
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,659
prayer and plan for what happens next

182
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,409
and the operational and the strategic

183
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,890
levels so let's consider an event you

184
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:46,440
have an alert take place what we mean by

185
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,460
reactionary in this case that alert

186
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,980
comes in with an indicator of

187
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,190
compromised by that time it's already

188
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,490
too late it's too late because the

189
00:07:53,190 --> 00:08:00,030
adversary like defenders has now had the

190
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:02,820
time to prepare plan and execute their

191
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,609
attack if you did not have the awareness

192
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,140
beforehand of their preparatory actions

193
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,190
you're likely going to be surprised at

194
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:15,300
the compromise that takes place where

195
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,640
CTIA comes in it looks to try and get

196
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,760
into that adversaries operational space

197
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,550
look beyond the horizon above and across

198
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,920
the horizon to try and take account of

199
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,740
what are their plans what are their

200
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,249
ideas their agendas their tactics their

201
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,919
techniques their motives they're in

202
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:35,589
ten armed with that information we can

203
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,149
then use that and apply that towards our

204
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:41,979
planning efforts to become more

205
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:43,870
proactive now what drives the CTI cycle

206
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,170
that helps us for that productivity well

207
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,069
essentially it's the intelligence cycle

208
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,599
we're not going to go into detail on

209
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,680
each of the phases here many of us are

210
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,300
familiar with those that we're gonna

211
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,489
cover that in our case study here a

212
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:00,699
little bit with Elias now going back to

213
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,290
the alert if you have true situational

214
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:05,109
awareness what you're going to find

215
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,939
behind the scenes is that to a

216
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:11,470
connectivity going back and forth

217
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:13,540
between the network operators on the

218
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,269
left side of our screen here and on the

219
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,069
right side the intelligence analyst both

220
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:21,490
have parts and pieces of the puzzle that

221
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:24,059
help develop that composite picture but

222
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,579
not only that you also have that

223
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:32,199
communication that goes northward with

224
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:34,508
c-suite and the risk managers in this

225
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:36,399
particular case you now have the

226
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,949
monitoring response layer that sits over

227
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,809
top of the situational awareness to

228
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:43,660
encourage that two-way communication

229
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:45,910
going back and forth so if we go back to

230
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,850
the shoe example so business

231
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,899
intelligence focused on the the

232
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,610
potential competitors out there

233
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,930
how'd you get ahead in the market

234
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,990
where's the threat of this folks in the

235
00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:00,550
threat but both work together to inform

236
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,309
each other so getting back on the track

237
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,559
here so we go back to the business

238
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:09,360
intelligence now you're considering

239
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:14,740
motive or you're considering intent and

240
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:18,309
motive as to what matters in this case

241
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,910
again CTI is now informing across the

242
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:25,689
board in both directions it's important

243
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,639
that you know everybody understands if

244
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:30,639
something new is going to be put out by

245
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,660
business operations or by marketing you

246
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,399
need to understand that there's the

247
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,379
potential for new threats to arise

248
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,329
because of that that's where that

249
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,449
two-way constant communication takes

250
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,449
place

251
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:45,240
so now if we go back to our original car

252
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:49,050
example you know we're trying to move

253
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,060
from this tactical mindset and to move

254
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,770
towards a better understanding of the

255
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,140
landscape before us to see what the real

256
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,360
threats are out there and how to go and

257
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:05,029
avoid those this point I'm going to hand

258
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:08,339
it over to Elias so how do you implement

259
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:11,130
the framework that Michael has outlined

260
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,709
how do you do all these things that he

261
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,200
has just discussed in order to

262
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:19,500
illustrate this we have come up with

263
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,670
this case study within the case study we

264
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,529
focus on a company called ideal works

265
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:29,160
ideal works is not a very important

266
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:32,250
company they are small they're very

267
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,930
contained they make shoes they don't do

268
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:38,970
much that they see as great importance

269
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:40,410
however within the near future

270
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,190
they are coming to market with a new

271
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:46,949
product that new product is a new shoe

272
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,130
type with a special cushion that will

273
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:52,910
allow you to walk or run over a thousand

274
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:58,500
miles without the shoe need be replaced

275
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:01,079
without sustaining injury but since idea

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,660
works is now coming to market CTI

277
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,020
analysts within the company get the

278
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,829
inkling that they might be targeted for

279
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:13,199
their data that this new shoe represents

280
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,830
their main strategic competitive

281
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,959
advantage in order to properly protected

282
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,720
to properly protect against the threat

283
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,189
they use the intelligence cycle the

284
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,339
first part of the intelligent cycles

285
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:30,930
requirements and planning what are you

286
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:33,570
looking for unfortunately we have always

287
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,719
limited personnel we have limited time

288
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,300
we have limited money we cannot answer

289
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,850
every single threat question so we must

290
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,800
narrow the search we must figure out

291
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,550
what it is that we're looking for

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,889
and we do that by posing intelligence

293
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,839
requirements these are questions that

294
00:12:50,889 --> 00:13:00,040
must be answered previously Network

295
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,369
Operations has reported some interesting

296
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,589
unusual activity on their networks no

297
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:07,899
penetration yet but just in probing at

298
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:10,749
the boundary from connections

299
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:13,540
originating from fictional entity nation

300
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:17,799
state X they don't know what

301
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:22,689
nation-state X wants so it's time to

302
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:27,790
post some questions what data might

303
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:32,199
nations say X be interested in in what

304
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:36,219
way might nations stay x target idea

305
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:40,299
works for its data these two principle

306
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,309
intelligence requirements will lead

307
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:49,600
further collection efforts and help

308
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:52,779
guide analysts to the answer now that

309
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,369
you have some idea of what it is that

310
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,549
you're looking for what you what you're

311
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:59,980
trying to achieve here we can move on to

312
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:04,269
collection you can think of this as a

313
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,100
research phase but it's not just you

314
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:07,959
know reading some articles putting them

315
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,779
into a thing and you know laying them

316
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:13,179
out there this doesn't just include

317
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,699
looking at papers written by someone

318
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:17,439
else this includes looking into your own

319
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:19,779
network seeing exactly what the

320
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,990
technical indicators are saying looking

321
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,939
at possibly dark web discussions

322
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,449
peer-reviewed research press religious

323
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:30,368
what is the geopolitical situation

324
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:33,309
surrounding nations stay acts what are

325
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,730
they doing what might you be looking for

326
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,730
in the future

327
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:42,559
this collection process also serves the

328
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:46,729
basis for indicated indications and

329
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,529
warnings that are utilized by by CGI

330
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:51,399
analysts and provided by Network defense

331
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:55,339
the technical indicators are passed to

332
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,509
network operations so that they know the

333
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:05,569
kinds of things that they should be

334
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:07,729
looking for as well all the data that

335
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:10,968
you get from collection is not

336
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,769
necessarily easily digestible right at

337
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:15,979
the start it can require a lot of

338
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:18,949
processing if sometimes in or just to

339
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:21,319
make it like readable and understandable

340
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:24,169
by the analysts but there's also some in

341
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:26,598
some initial crunching that can speed up

342
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:29,619
the analytical process so things like

343
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:33,769
language translation metadata extraction

344
00:15:29,619 --> 00:15:37,879
seam analysis all the things that make

345
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:40,249
it actually possible to analyze and this

346
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,749
is mostly automated stuff this is wrote

347
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:43,939
stuff there's very little actual

348
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:47,779
analytical work being done in this step

349
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:50,629
though in this step machine analysis

350
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:53,089
might identify some initial links that

351
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:57,220
analysts can go ahead and use to start

352
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,220
their start their analysis

353
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,670
now that you have some usable

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,030
information you move over to analysis

355
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:13,939
and production all the various bits of

356
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:16,550
information the disparate elements are

357
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,590
like pieces of a puzzle is the job of

358
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,500
analysts to try and take all these

359
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:26,180
disparate bits and assemble them into a

360
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:28,850
coach at picture of the situation for

361
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:31,880
the purposes of our case study the CTI

362
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,670
and Melissa idea works figure out that

363
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,130
nation CX is undergoing a extensive

364
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,550
military modernization program their

365
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:43,460
primary method of military defence and

366
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:46,310
attack is by using a large mostly

367
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,230
infantry base ground army they are

368
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,849
actively belligerent towards their

369
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:53,330
neighbors saying all kinds of crazy

370
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:56,000
things the shoe technology that ideal

371
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:59,060
works has been coming up with could

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,030
easily be applied to military Footwear

373
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,730
which would enable nation-state acts to

374
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:08,060
execute large-scale infantry maneuvers

375
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,640
quickly and efficiently without stopping

376
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,220
for as much injury without having to

377
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,480
change as much Footwear also reduces the

378
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,000
weight on the soldiers because they

379
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,829
don't have to carry those extra shoes so

380
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,130
on etc representing a possible tactical

381
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:28,879
advantage

382
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:30,590
there are also gaps in this CGI analysts

383
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,250
are not necessarily going to be able to

384
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,929
find out every single little thing

385
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,570
particularly stemming from the initial

386
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,080
intelligence requirements that they had

387
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,889
at the beginning of this in this case

388
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:48,470
patients say X might in addition to the

389
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,120
newfangled cyber methods might use

390
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,990
traditional intelligence collection

391
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:57,909
methods to target idea works for as data

392
00:17:52,990 --> 00:18:00,560
CGI analysts have no idea at this point

393
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,650
what how much they are investing in

394
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,620
traditional intelligence collection

395
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,610
versus cyber focused collection efforts

396
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,529
gaps such as these will be fed back into

397
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,469
requirements and planning once the

398
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:17,150
intelligence cycle restarts and be used

399
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,130
to generate new intelligence

400
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,650
requirements in order to be able to

401
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,650
identify incoming threat vectors

402
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:32,510
actionable intelligence does not help

403
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:35,210
anyone if no one has it if it's all

404
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,539
siloed within the analysis and

405
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,940
production cell and you know they might

406
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:43,370
know that something funky is coming but

407
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,370
no one else does that serves absolutely

408
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,860
zero purpose so during dissemination

409
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:51,709
actionable readable intelligence gets

410
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,199
distributed to those who need it this

411
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,809
includes not just network defense this

412
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,990
also includes the c-suite executives and

413
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,850
parts of the supply chain that require

414
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:09,230
this information in order to defend

415
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:12,620
their networks monitoring response forms

416
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:16,309
the substrate upon which communication

417
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,299
flows from net offs and CTI but also to

418
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,639
the c-suite

419
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:23,690
business development business

420
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:26,000
intelligence all the various bits of the

421
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,220
company and of the organization that

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,640
actually require this information in

423
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:34,250
order to be able to make intelligent

424
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,830
decisions upon not just defense but upon

425
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:40,039
what moves the company will make in the

426
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:43,908
future this also enables net ops to pass

427
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:48,220
back real-time indications and warnings

428
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:52,730
to analysts for use in further analysis

429
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:54,529
the kinds of actions enabled by the sort

430
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,250
of intelligence is all going to depend

431
00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:03,679
on the exact scenario but one of the

432
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:06,169
things that that that decision-makers

433
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,419
must do is of course the risk management

434
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,560
and we know that when you're dealing

435
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:12,410
with

436
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,100
he points of data like in this case the

437
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:18,380
shoe technology you need that data to be

438
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,300
available but there's also some

439
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,150
reservation being stolen but with

440
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:26,000
actionable intelligence in hand saying

441
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,700
that yes this information is that high

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,800
risk of actually being exfiltrated and

443
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,890
we need to change the trade-offs we make

444
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:37,460
for data security and data availability

445
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:39,440
and as such the CIO orders that all

446
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,330
information pertaining to the process is

447
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,250
air-gapped from the rest of the network

448
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:49,490
and not connected to the internet

449
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:52,850
requiring physical access by undergoing

450
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,890
this process this allows you to have

451
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,129
your organization move from a purely

452
00:20:54,890 --> 00:21:00,520
reactive tactical focus to a proactive

453
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,230
state that is able to anticipate

454
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,090
oncoming threats perhaps before they

455
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,280
even make contact with your network and

456
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,280
certainly before you are compromised

457
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:17,750
undergoing the CTI process integrates a

458
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:21,770
large number of disciplines penetration

459
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:26,140
testing Incident Response knowledge

460
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:30,350
management intelligence requirements and

461
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:33,650
of keynote that we waffle Kisan are the

462
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:36,620
scenes or the C and D analysts or net

463
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:41,030
defenders and the open the classical

464
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:44,060
open source analysts the integration

465
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:46,610
between these two roles are what really

466
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,639
makes the process work and in order to

467
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,219
do that effectively the C and D analysts

468
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,820
requires a foundational understanding of

469
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,470
open source analysis techniques

470
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,360
conversely open source analysts in order

471
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,730
to be effective need a basic

472
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,229
understanding of cyber warfare and the

473
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,230
TTP's often used

474
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,690
when this is accomplished you're able to

475
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,899
build the cyber threat intelligence

476
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,540
analysts people who are able to work

477
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,700
independently or as part of a team

478
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,530
without with all the disparate bits

479
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,750
coming together in order to make it

480
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,970
function to wrap this up to sort of

481
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:30,420
bring this down into some more easily

482
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,930
digestible bits the key things are that

483
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,670
you need to proactively take steps to

484
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,510
identify threats before they actually

485
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,690
make contact with the network boundary

486
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:46,080
you need interoperability and

487
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,060
communication between your traditional

488
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,800
CTI

489
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,950
analytical personnel and the network

490
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,399
defense team they're actually see the

491
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:58,470
day to day network operations and to a

492
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,140
cup and to accomplish threat

493
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,780
identification utilize the intelligence

494
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:08,220
cycle to proactively identify threats

495
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:11,399
and generate actual intelligence that

496
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:14,000
can be used to mitigate and that

497
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
concludes our presentation
