1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,820
[Music]

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,549
so to get started first I want to set an

4
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,650
expectation which is first of all this

5
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,840
is going to be one of the in terms of

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,779
technical content lighter presentation

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,240
er that's on purpose right I also want

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,190
to stipulate so I come from so I come

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,740
from a slightly similar background to

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,630
cliff Stoll I am NOT like cliff Stoll

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,829
I'll just set that from the beginning I

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,420
don't have nearly that much energy I

13
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:39,160
would break my ankle if I jumped as much

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,810
as he did but I don't come there's a lot

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,110
of folks here who come from a military

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,430
background or an icy background or maybe

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,739
I just an intelligence analysis

18
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:50,140
background in general mine is different

19
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,989
I was educated in mathematics and hard

20
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,149
sciences right my degrees in math went

21
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,890
from there to a UNIX system enroll for a

22
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,320
long time you can tell by the by the

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,000
neckbeard and then from there to

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,440
incident response and finally a thread

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,489
and tell because hey the hours were

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,789
better and I knew when I would be

27
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:08,289
traveling in advance so based on that

28
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm going to be talking about some of

29
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:14,049
the same general sorts of ways we think

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,529
about problems but from the perspective

31
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:19,749
not so much of intelligence community

32
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:22,090
and military analysis but from the

33
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:24,969
perspective of science right and I mean

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:27,939
here very generally the the philosophy

35
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:31,178
of science so why are we talking about

36
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:33,579
this well so first of all to the extent

37
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:36,670
that our Intel analysis or our analyses

38
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:38,380
in general support thing that are that

39
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,959
can be also classified as forensic

40
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,619
investigation that matters we use that

41
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,109
word a lot right to the point that sans

42
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,209
has turned it into a verb right to

43
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:53,559
forensic 8 things but the reality is

44
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:55,810
that forensics has a meaning right when

45
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,630
we talk about something being being a

46
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,929
forensic investigation we mean that it

47
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,539
can work for a court of law for Guardian

48
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,700
Public Policy or to a level of

49
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,310
confidence that we're comfortable at

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,490
being part of the national conversation

51
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,620
we have that don't we

52
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,930
so when we say that we're doing a

53
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,770
forensic investigation that is holding

54
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,690
it to a very very high standard that we

55
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,900
are expecting ourselves and our

56
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,060
colleagues to meet and even outside of

57
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,910
forensic investigation the people in

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:32,780
these sorts of buildings depend on our

59
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:35,420
work right and the courthouses whether

60
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,620
it's criminal actions or just lawsuits

61
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,440
and civil actions in legislative bodies

62
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:45,020
executive branches people running large

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,780
or otherwise important organizations

64
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,180
they depend on what we do and I would

65
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,450
argue that much of the leadership of

66
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,350
this field is in this room so it's

67
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,019
incumbent on us and on our colleagues to

68
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,350
do the best work we can because these

69
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,660
folks count on us and the quality of our

70
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,470
work and so I'm going to talk about

71
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,320
three general types of areas to watch

72
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,800
out for again from the perspective of

73
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,780
some of scientific analysis to the

74
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,270
extent that we can apply it here and the

75
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,770
first is falsifiability now this is a

76
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,940
word that when you first look at it if

77
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,190
you've ever seen it before you may

78
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,310
misunderstand what it means to be clear

79
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,220
I do not mean in any way shape or form

80
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:35,300
falsifying coming up with false evidence

81
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:38,359
fake facts those sorts of things what I

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,910
mean specifically are an idea that so

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,180
this is Sir Karl Popper in the 20th

84
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,910
century he was one of the great founder

85
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,560
we can say foundational thinkers of what

86
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,700
we call a philosophy of science and he

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,710
had this idea about what he thought he

88
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,910
called falsifiability which is this if

89
00:03:51,710 --> 00:04:00,200
you have a hypothesis if you have an

90
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:02,900
assertion you need to it needs to be

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,980
falsifiable in the sense that you can

92
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,520
imagine you can conceive of a test or a

93
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,190
circumstance that would conceivably

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,450
disprove your hypothesis not really

95
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,640
looking for evidence to support your

96
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,019
conclusion but I want if I think that

97
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,329
this has happening because of this

98
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:22,820
reason I want to go find stuff that

99
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,830
would invalidate my hypothesis

100
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,680
and it's easy to cherry-pick evidence

101
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,530
that supports it what do I mean by that

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,570
okay don't get scared by a little bit of

103
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,219
propositional logic I even put it in

104
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,880
English instead of the normal symbols

105
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,360
that look

106
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,860
yeah Alex man Alex so Alex made my heart

107
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,680
go out pitter-patter all he always does

108
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,060
but when he but when I saw the equators

109
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,690
if there's like oh that's a man after my

110
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,610
own heart

111
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,680
but I simplified here so we can make

112
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,360
we're gonna talk about two basic kinds

113
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,730
of statements right it'll break them

114
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,570
down them very simple for an

115
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,590
observational statement it's just what

116
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,380
it sounds like I see this I see I there

117
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,609
exists a blatte one at least one Black

118
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:07,310
Swan just one a categorical statement

119
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,140
says about all objects of a type and a

120
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,920
categorical state a categorical

121
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:16,219
statement says all swans are white now

122
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,580
what kind of evidence do you need to

123
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,930
prove or more importantly disprove your

124
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,780
statement in order to prove that there's

125
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,070
a black swan you just need to find one

126
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,229
black swan in order to falsify it though

127
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,170
you would need to go through every

128
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,580
single Swan in the world and show that

129
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,070
none of them are black swans that's

130
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,219
really hard to do right categorically

131
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:46,190
the same thing categorically in order to

132
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,170
say all swans are white you to prove it

133
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,790
you've got to go through all the Swans

134
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,440
in the world that's a real pain to do

135
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,480
again somebody's inevitably got one

136
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,230
hidden that you can't see but to

137
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:02,180
disprove your categorical statement you

138
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:05,300
just need one black swan so we think

139
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,840
about as we're making assertions think

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,960
about the kind of evidence that would

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,880
disprove your assertion and try to find

142
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,630
that kind of evidence to the extent that

143
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,630
you can

144
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:21,419
the next thing is cognitive bias we've

145
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:23,249
talked about that a little bit this week

146
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,169
now when I say bias it's really

147
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,909
important to know to understand in depth

148
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,039
what we're talking about because that

149
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,409
word has some emotion associated with it

150
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,029
right you're biased doesn't feel very

151
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:36,989
good when somebody says they do it we

152
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:39,509
are not talking at all here about any

153
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:42,568
kind of intentional or even cultural

154
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:45,300
kinds of bias there's some overlap in

155
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:46,830
things that it can be cognitive bias in

156
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,199
that soar but really we're focused here

157
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,508
on bias in a technical sense so bias in

158
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,479
a mathematical sense really just means a

159
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:00,300
systematic deviation from the true value

160
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,419
right so they met in terms of a scale a

161
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,809
biased scale is one where either the

162
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,789
zero point isn't right or maybe as you

163
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:11,029
put on one pound it reflects more or

164
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:14,219
less than at one pound systematically

165
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:17,159
that would be a bias scale in order to

166
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:19,979
then make sure that our scales and our

167
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,719
analyses are free from bias we have to

168
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,959
do the same thing we have to calibrate

169
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:28,589
carefully and constantly and regularly

170
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:32,969
verify that our process is free from

171
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:35,369
bias so what are some cognitive biases

172
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,959
to watch out for there are a bunch

173
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,399
they'll have a reference later to two

174
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,529
more but here are three that I

175
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,110
personally find particularly important

176
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:46,469
in in my work and in looking at the work

177
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:48,649
that we as a discipline do and the first

178
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:50,729
is confirmation bias and this is

179
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:53,069
relatively straightforward to understand

180
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,800
confirmation bias says that I pay more

181
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:59,189
attention to evidence that matches what

182
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,069
I already think than to evidence that

183
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,529
doesn't right we see how this ties in a

184
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,289
little bit to falsifiability so you're

185
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:10,439
looking at a bunch of evidence you

186
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,969
started to in your mind kind of generate

187
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,579
a hypothesis and now you have a couple

188
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:16,739
of data points that don't align with it

189
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,539
confirmation bias says those are

190
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:20,698
probably not valid or not credible

191
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:25,740
because they don't line up with what I

192
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:28,360
already think or somebody who disagrees

193
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,979
with me is less credible not because of

194
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,509
some what they're actually saying but

195
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,399
because they disagree with me and

196
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:37,180
therefore they're not worth paying

197
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,559
attention to that's dangerous and when

198
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:42,098
you're thinking critically you're trying

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:45,160
to think accurately a framing bias oh I

200
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,290
guarantee everybody who's ever worked

201
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,240
with incident response or network

202
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,459
security has run into this from one side

203
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,920
of the other maybe both right so imagine

204
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,410
you have a system that has an outage of

205
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,630
some sort a freemium bias can happen in

206
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:01,870
both directions the incident responder

207
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,450
immediately says oh it's probably an

208
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,640
intrusion a communications disruption

209
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,970
can mean only one thing invasion

210
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Thanks I did Oh see I knew somebody

211
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,320
would get that this system in comes in

212
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,649
and says the opposite it's an outage

213
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,600
it's just an outage probably windows had

214
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:22,240
to reboot or a disk got filled up or

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,910
what have you the framing bias looks at

216
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,519
the problem from only an existing

217
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,959
perspective rather than being open to

218
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,420
both possibilities and looking at

219
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,180
evidence that would support or or tend

220
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,510
to go against one conclusion or the

221
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,250
other fundamental attribution error is

222
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,269
my favorite well no it's not good right

223
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,720
but it's my favorite to think about

224
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:49,540
because we all do it in our day to day

225
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,740
lives and it's not good there but here

226
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm talking about our work and it's

227
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,839
really not good here fundamental

228
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,949
attribution error says this when you

229
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,899
make a mistake

230
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,229
I say it's because of some core

231
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:04,750
characteristic about you when I make a

232
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,029
mistake it's just the individual

233
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,459
specific circumstances so there's a car

234
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:11,439
accident if I'm in a car accident all

235
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:15,099
the Sun reflected off of somebody else's

236
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,170
window and I couldn't see or somebody

237
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,690
else did so it's it's I just couldn't

238
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,680
avoid it there's no nothing I could do

239
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,269
somebody else gonna cartoon it oh

240
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,859
they're an idiot driver they don't know

241
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,779
what they're doing maybe it's something

242
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,550
about their gender or their ethnicity or

243
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,540
just in general everybody else is an

244
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,279
idiot but I'm smart that's fundamental

245
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,990
attribution error because they're

246
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,000
thinking by the way the same thing about

247
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,529
you that jerk cut me off because they're

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,560
an idiot driver and are they

249
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:44,379
you just made a mistake or maybe there

250
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,599
was some valid reason right these are

251
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,910
cognitive biases that we have to be

252
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,029
careful among others right that

253
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,399
frequently affect the kind of work that

254
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:57,519
we do

255
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,319
finally logical fallacies oh I could

256
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,610
give I could go on and on for hours I

257
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:02,199
won't we all want to get out of here I

258
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,059
noticed we got flights the cash and

259
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:05,740
stuff about logical fallacy so let's

260
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:08,529
talk about a few that are relevant here

261
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,399
the association fallacy is relatively

262
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:11,800
straightforward so let's think about

263
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,360
this Venn diagram right we can look and

264
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,609
we can say everything that's in circle a

265
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,139
all a right is also inside circle beef

266
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:25,089
everything that is a type a is also have

267
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:27,009
type B all a or B got it all they are

268
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,309
also in C everything that's in circle a

269
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:32,860
is also inside circle C straight forward

270
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:33,969
so far all of this is on track and

271
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,709
absolutely correct

272
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:43,139
the association fallacy says all a are B

273
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:45,250
and all a are C therefore B equals C

274
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,199
clearly that's not true when we look at

275
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,329
the whole picture right clearly we can

276
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:53,439
see there are a lot of elements in B

277
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:54,939
that are not in C and vice-versa but we

278
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,189
make the mistake of saying that because

279
00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:00,610
there are at least some elements that

280
00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:02,680
are in both groups therefore those two

281
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,809
groups are basically coincident and

282
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,839
that's not true that's the association

283
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:10,689
fallacy the sharpshooter fallacy and

284
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,819
aside is often called the Texas

285
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,379
sharpshooter fallacy I'm from Texas and

286
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,729
I take issue with this we all know that

287
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,730
it's the Oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy

288
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,560
the sharpshooter fallacy said is

289
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,529
basically like this a guy goes out and

290
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,209
shoots at the side of a barn

291
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,740
afterwards he goes up to the barn finds

292
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,750
a cluster of his shots that are closely

293
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,980
grouped draws a circle around it and

294
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,470
says that's the target I was shooting

295
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,029
that this is not right right there are

296
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,020
two kind of general types of problems

297
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,950
they're closely related they're really

298
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,120
different perspectives on the same

299
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:49,370
problem here one is in our work right

300
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,220
you can't use the same data that you use

301
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,200
to generate your hypothesis as you do to

302
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,810
prove or disprove it right it becomes

303
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,640
circular so if you say yes it has

304
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,680
special application and Alex's work

305
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,240
right if you say I'm gonna look at these

306
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,029
logs I'm gonna find oh I think this is

307
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,800
what's happening now I need to go get a

308
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,600
new set of data maybe the next day's

309
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,250
logs or a different set of logs and see

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,850
if I can make that same observation and

311
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:16,430
see if I can confirm or invalidate my

312
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:19,160
hypothesis the other thing is that's

313
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,770
fine maybe you were but what about all

314
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,589
the other shots outside of that that is

315
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,199
we tend to look at evidence at the

316
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:29,690
similarities among evidence and not try

317
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,839
to account for the outliers that could

318
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,130
also be valid measurements right great

319
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,540
you were stood at the target what

320
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,820
happened to all those other things that

321
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:42,319
went off target why was that how good of

322
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:44,690
a sharpshooter are you and finally the

323
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,130
streetlight effect oh I remember hearing

324
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,430
this as a kid and I just loved this

325
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,660
story so imagine it's a cold dark night

326
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,459
somebody's lost their keys in a parking

327
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,930
lot and they're looking for their keys

328
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:56,329
they're going everywhere trying to find

329
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,219
them and along comes let's say a parking

330
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,930
lot attendant police officer security

331
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,670
guard whomever somebody who's willing to

332
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,709
help and they say hey what's going on I

333
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,670
lost my keys somewhere I'll help you

334
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,709
find them so they're looking around

335
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,110
they're looking under the cars and

336
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,819
everywhere and not finding it and

337
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,220
finally the parking lot attendant says

338
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,420
are you sure you lost them here no I

339
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:18,620
lost them over there but the lights

340
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,449
better over here okay so just because

341
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,070
you have more visibility in an area

342
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,029
doesn't mean that's the right place to

343
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,680
be looking for what you're trying to

344
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,400
find because that may not actually be

345
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,810
where it is don't make that assumption

346
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,579
especially if you already have a

347
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,670
prior reason to believe that's not where

348
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,670
it is this is the streetlight effect now

349
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:41,910
I talked about a lot of these sorts

350
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:45,300
general classes of problems and you can

351
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,670
drill down into great detail into any

352
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,439
one of them but how do we compensate for

353
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,479
these how do we compensate for these

354
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,050
fallacies these biases how do we make

355
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,720
sure that we are falsifying our

356
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,459
hypotheses and aside which Simoes work

357
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,430
like this I think at lunch today it is

358
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,839
really really important not to get

359
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:09,689
confused on the distinction between a

360
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,339
hypothesis and a theory colloquially we

361
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,980
say oh I got a theory about what just

362
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:17,760
happened no you don't you have a

363
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,800
hypothesis the scientific method we

364
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,360
learn as kids right you get some initial

365
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,890
data submission lob servation you

366
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,570
generate some hypothesis now you get

367
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,810
some more data new fresh data like we

368
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,640
talked about right and as you find

369
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,619
evidence that supports this eventually

370
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,800
you can support it you have evidence to

371
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,830
back it up and now it's a theory ok that

372
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,449
aside to jigger the first thing I would

373
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,640
say is go back and watch Rob darkness

374
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,510
clock today because that's literally

375
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,270
just a little fantastic laundry list of

376
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,400
ways to to compensate for these I'm

377
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,900
going to talk about two in particular

378
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,939
the first one is red teaming and here I

379
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,380
don't really mean the red team or the

380
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,480
network security sense although that's

381
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,160
kind of a special case of what we're

382
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,730
talking about here right there's a that

383
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,750
term came from somewhere right in

384
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:11,730
science before a paper or a result has

385
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:13,530
any acceptability at all it should go

386
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,140
through peer review right we talked

387
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:19,050
about we've heard the term maybe peer

388
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,699
reviewed papers Rob referred to the kind

389
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,250
of a similar idea as a murder board I'll

390
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,510
be scientists or gentler people we call

391
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,860
it we call it a peer review they're not

392
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,600
really that generated it literally is

393
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,990
the same thing of sometimes meaner right

394
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,330
but the idea is that somebody else is

395
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:37,140
reviewing your work specifically with

396
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:41,180
the idea to find problems define

397
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,170
weaknesses to find mistakes

398
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,890
they're gonna go and they're gonna say

399
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,870
mmm

400
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,370
you make an you make a conclusion here

401
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,660
that is not well supported by your data

402
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,149
because of this region are you've made a

403
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,829
mistake in this calculation or you

404
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:54,510
missed these important things you didn't

405
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,180
reference this other work because of

406
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,980
this that's red teaming that doesn't

407
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,079
mean they dislike you well maybe they do

408
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,570
it doesn't matter because it's about as

409
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,419
as I love the line earlier we're here to

410
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,569
defend our organizations not our ego

411
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,490
this is also true for any kind of

412
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,129
analytic work right we're here to

413
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,939
accomplish some mission not to feel good

414
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,929
about ourselves

415
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,059
maybe that mission is to advance

416
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,530
understanding of the world and maybe

417
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,770
it's to defend an organization either

418
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,649
way red teaming helps us avoid their

419
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,879
a-hole but you can formalize it the way

420
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,730
that he talked about it can be as

421
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,850
informal in a smaller organization or in

422
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:34,470
a tight cell where you say hey I'm gonna

423
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,240
go over to my to a buddy over here who

424
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,040
maybe she knows much more about it than

425
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,360
I do I'm gonna say hey can you look at

426
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,030
this before I send this out and find

427
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,149
although tell me what's bad about it

428
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,149
seriously

429
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:48,679
be merciless that is the point because

430
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,940
if your submits say that you're

431
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,030
providing something that's gonna go to

432
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,150
court you can guarantee that's the

433
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,780
opposition's job you're providing it to

434
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,150
a policymaker or a decision-maker they

435
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,710
can be even more ruthless because their

436
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,559
neck is on the line for the decision

437
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,870
that's going to be made right so red

438
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,660
teaming says let me do this in advance

439
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:16,520
and have somebody else try to see what I

440
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,400
didn't see the next one

441
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:21,780
Mike's heart just went pitter-patter is

442
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,200
analysis of competing hypotheses now to

443
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,399
me when I first saw this I said well duh

444
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,140
this is what we learned like in third

445
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,970
grade right but it's a formalized

446
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:33,000
structured way of carrying out the

447
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,169
scientific method the basic idea again

448
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,390
we talked about it several times this

449
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:38,669
week and for good reason because that's

450
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,770
how important it is you list your

451
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,169
observations you list the possible

452
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,000
explanations you assign some level of

453
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:46,830
credibility to your observations and you

454
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,150
see what which ones are consistent and

455
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,850
which ones are not

456
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,650
this is literally a formalized method of

457
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,029
what we all learned when we were 10

458
00:18:54,650 --> 00:19:00,890
years old or whatever you're finding

459
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:05,750
hypotheses you're seeing how it supports

460
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:09,169
it and hopefully ruling some out with

461
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,400
that said before I close I want to MIT

462
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,799
talkable one thing that happened last

463
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,559
night that's relevant here when we are

464
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,250
at the I hope you all enjoyed those are

465
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:22,460
overcome the hot cocoa at our sand ski

466
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,500
chalet and one of the things that Rob

467
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,409
Lee let off with was the question what

468
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,610
makes you optimistic about our field and

469
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:30,320
I got to tell you is you could probably

470
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,479
tell if you were there I quit a little

471
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,950
bit with the premise right I'm not

472
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,140
necessarily that doesn't mean I go to

473
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,659
the other extreme right you can be not

474
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:41,210
super optimistic and yet still be not

475
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,399
cynical I'm not necessarily optimistic

476
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,549
but I want to be optimistic and there's

477
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:50,629
a reason for that and that is because

478
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:53,149
you inspire me and I hope that we

479
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,350
inspire each other the work that we're

480
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:57,469
doing as I said at the beginning is

481
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,500
important some folks are working in

482
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,029
national security or law enforcement

483
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,240
some folks are working on other issues

484
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:06,980
of literally vital I mean life and death

485
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,480
here importance we saw with Sergio's

486
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:11,090
talk earlier about his global

487
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,279
emancipation Network even when the work

488
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,889
that we do is more prosaic and not

489
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,000
necessarily life-or-death it certainly

490
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,210
impacts people's livelihoods

491
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,270
even if we're protecting credit cards

492
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:26,149
right that has a financial impact on

493
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:28,940
real people so the work that we do is

494
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:31,729
important and I know that we take it

495
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,279
seriously and we want to do the best

496
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,010
that we can to support the missions of

497
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,500
whatever organizations our work benefits

498
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:46,510
and so because of that I want to

499
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:49,159
reinforce Lee because ultimately that is

500
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,710
really what we're for is to support that

501
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,770
those missions

502
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,770
you

503
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,889
