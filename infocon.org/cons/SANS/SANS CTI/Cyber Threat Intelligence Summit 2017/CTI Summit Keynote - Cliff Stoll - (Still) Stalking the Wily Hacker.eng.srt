1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,810
(audience applauding)

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,380
- I'm tickled and
honored to be here.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,115
Quite beyond what ...

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,353
Richard et al may
say partly because

5
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:25,825
each of you know
far more than I do.

6
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:28,628
And so this morning,

7
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,698
the vendors have
noticed me sort of just

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,634
leaning over their tables,
spying, and picking up things.

9
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:39,372
So, rather than trying to tell
you what is happening now,

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,109
all of you are far more
familiar with this than I am.

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,245
I'll tell you what happened
a million years ago

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,547
when there were dinosaurs
and brontosauruses

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,250
and pterodactyls hanging around,

14
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,619
when the idea of
computer security,

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,621
the phrase didn't exist.

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,423
So ...

17
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,192
To do this talk,

18
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,596
I went up in my
attic and found some,

19
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:08,634
what in the 1980s would've
been called PowerPoint.

20
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,237
(audience laughing)

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,006
These are viewgraphs.

22
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,177
And the astonishing
part about it is,

23
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:21,347
unlike PowerPoint, you can
actually hold it up and read it.

24
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:27,020
This is a set of viewgraphs that

25
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,893
I was invited in 1987 to do a
talk at Fort Meade at the NSA.

26
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,995
And they in advance said,

27
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,565
we have these questions
we're gonna ask,

28
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,733
you can talk about this,
this, and this, and this.

29
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,904
But they wouldn't let me walk
in with my own viewgraphs

30
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,708
because at the time,
they were paranoid,

31
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,977
not that they're
not paranoid now,

32
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,445
but at the time
they were paranoid

33
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,547
that you could take a
piece of acetate like this,

34
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:58,852
charge it electrically
against a woolen surface,

35
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:02,155
put it on top of a
classified piece of paper,

36
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,792
walk off with it, and
then dust it with powder

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,627
and steal information.

38
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:14,667
These viewgraphs are
genuine NSA generated

39
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,939
pieces of acetate that I
was able to walk off with.

40
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,940
Here you go.

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,644
Oh great, they're
outta focus too.

42
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,478
Focus.

43
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,248
Someone over here is
going to come over

44
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,983
and focus it for
me, aren't they?

45
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,888
They're not going
to walk down slowly.

46
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,923
They're going to run
quickly, aren't they?

47
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,858
(audience laughing)

48
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,195
And in focusing it,
they will find that.

49
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,534
Auto? Oh.

50
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,936
(audience laughing)

51
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,506
And in focusing it,
ah, look at that!

52
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,275
Astonishing! Amazing!

53
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,643
Hot ziggity, great!

54
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,112
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

55
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,780
You can walk back slowly now.

56
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,682
(audience laughing)

57
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,516
Zoom out.

58
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,953
I'll push auto again.

59
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,591
Anyway, this is a talk that
I gave a long time ago.

60
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,932
At the time that
I made this, the,

61
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,135
geez, come on, zoom, zoom.

62
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,438
The place I worked,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory

63
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,941
had a rule which many of you
all have in your displays,

64
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,478
in your vendor materials
that you must have a logo

65
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:35,448
on every one of your
slides and so on, so.

66
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:39,619
Now on the average, you've
seen a logo on each slide.

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:45,358
These are people that I
mention from 30 years ago.

68
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,429
These are the people who
actually did the work.

69
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,199
I'm claiming credit
for stuff that

70
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,803
Marv Atchley, Bruce
Bauer, Joanne Crafton,

71
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,472
these are people who I
worked with 30 years ago.

72
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,407
And they of course
were the computer jocks

73
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,942
and the smart people.

74
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,779
I was the just the droid in
the background doing things.

75
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,381
Getting to business!

76
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,285
I'm sorry, I'm
discovering these as I go.

77
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,588
It's memory lane ville for me.

78
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,290
What do you do when
you find somebody

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,592
breaking into your computer?

80
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,431
Remember this is a
talk from 30 years ago.

81
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,602
I'm speaking to people who I
assumed knew more than I did.

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,040
I assume now that each of
you know more than I do.

83
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,241
What do you do when
you find somebody

84
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,575
breaking into your computer?

85
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,877
Well, seems obvious.

86
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,812
You disable his access.

87
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,482
You make sure they can't get in.

88
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,785
You cork up whatever
holes you can find.

89
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,721
You tell the systems
people on it,

90
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,156
and you don't publicize it.

91
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:54,427
You keep your mouth shut
because you'll get into trouble.

92
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,598
So, around August of 1986,

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,002
I detected somebody breaking
into our Unix systems

94
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,039
at Lawrence Berkeley Labs
out on the west coast.

95
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,073
And I didn't know any better.

96
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,676
Nobody told this to me, so, so,

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,947
when I find an intruder,
I let the bastard in.

98
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,218
I leave the hole wide open.

99
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,989
On the other hand, I
wanna monitor everything.

100
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,758
I wanna see what
the connectivity is.

101
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,294
I wanna see what
they're typing in,

102
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,462
what they're getting back,

103
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,998
what keywords
they're looking for,

104
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,801
where are they going,
from here to there?

105
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,969
Meanwhile, I wanna
trace things backwards.

106
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:39,939
I wanna find out, you know,

107
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,642
what connects to what and who?

108
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,877
You know, what's
the connectivity?

109
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,713
And to me at the time,

110
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,486
TCP/IP, this was in the earliest
days, and I thought, oh,

111
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,255
if you wanna track something,
you don't track things

112
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,692
by saying oh, I'll
look at its IP address.

113
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,029
You track things, I wanna
find its electrical address.

114
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,299
As it turned out, I
would take voltmeters

115
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,334
and try to trace packets

116
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,902
through routers and
things like this.

117
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,437
I didn't know any better.

118
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,806
Nobody was saying, hey
that's a stupid idea.

119
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,541
So on the other hand.

120
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,681
Oh, did I do that?

121
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:23,850
- I think you might have.

122
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,051
- I might have.

123
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,853
Oh, can you figure
out how to plug it in?

124
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,521
- I'll see.
- Great.

125
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,091
On the other hand,
I wanna make noise!

126
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,694
I wanna tell people about this.

127
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,832
(audience laughing)

128
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,099
Did I do a bad?

129
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,372
I wanna tell people about it.

130
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:50,209
It seems to me that
it's our responsibility

131
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:54,380
not just to watch out for
what's happening on our system.

132
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,484
It's our responsibility
to figure out

133
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:04,257
how to tell people in the
field what's happening.

134
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,258
It's my job.

135
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,060
And in physics, in.

136
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,598
Boy, I really screwed
things up, didn't I?

137
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,599
Well, great.

138
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,602
So my apologies, guys.

139
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,410
So.

140
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,616
As you can see, when.

141
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,458
When you don't
understand something,

142
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,461
when you don't
understand something,

143
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,565
when you don't understand
what's going on,

144
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,468
it's an opportunity
for you and me

145
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,403
to do basic research.

146
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,571
To do physics.

147
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,241
To do what you
were trained to do.

148
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,043
And to me this means

149
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:01,147
you apply whatever physical
principles you can come up with.

150
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,048
Do physics.

151
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,220
Do the science and do the
very boring and rather

152
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,390
mundane research that
we're accustomed to.

153
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,396
And at the time in the '80s,

154
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,832
this meant using the
tools available to me.

155
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:24,003
Things like oscilloscopes,
signal tracers and such not.

156
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,242
Probably the most useful
of these things and

157
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,948
the one tool that I find still
today unused is right here.

158
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,085
You keep a notebook.

159
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,123
I'm astonished at how few
people write things down.

160
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,595
And by writing things
down, I don't mean

161
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,732
you keep a log in the back
of one of your Unix boxes.

162
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,067
No, I mean your handwriting.

163
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,069
Because.

164
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:02,475
Well, when I was
at observatories,

165
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,646
the idea was if you don't write
it down, it didn't happen!

166
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,651
It's one thing to
collect a huge log,

167
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,120
and it's another
thing to have a system

168
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,456
that will analyze this
log of which I had a

169
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:21,260
delightful chat not half
an hour ago with people who

170
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,031
have built wonderful
software to analyze logs

171
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,936
and IP tables and
watching for intrusions.

172
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,639
But having done so,

173
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:39,445
having done so, there's still
a question of how do you,

174
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,848
how do you actually.

175
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,122
How do you actually
communicate this to others?

176
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,559
It's necessary to
summarize, think about it,

177
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,997
and I find there's no
substitute for a real logbook.

178
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,968
So having said that, I'll
say the other things are

179
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,704
you do your own homework.

180
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,442
You don't let other people
do your homework for you.

181
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,778
It seems obvious, but
everyone will say,

182
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,215
oh, I want an answer.

183
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,150
Nobody's going to help.

184
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,323
Would it help if I
sort of wiggled this?

185
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,727
I did a real bad thing,
I'm sorry people.

186
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,896
You can get even later.

187
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,870
You do your own homework.

188
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,906
You find new methodologies,
you figure out things

189
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,641
that you can do on your system

190
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,377
that haven't been done before.

191
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,112
Again, basic physics.

192
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,947
You trust what you can prove.

193
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,016
You ignore the rumors.

194
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:54,185
You ignore the sense of,
oh I think it's so and so.

195
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,458
It's what you can prove.

196
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,293
What youR IP tells you.

197
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,530
Not what you sense.

198
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,100
And then finally, you
publish your results.

199
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,073
It's not enough to do the work.

200
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,675
Come here and do a talk.

201
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,412
Tell us, tell me
what's happened!

202
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,982
Publish what happens.

203
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,650
And finally, don't give up.

204
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,821
Everyone will want you to
go and do something useful.

205
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,723
Security is not useful.

206
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,593
Security gets in the
way of operations.

207
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,729
Everyone will tell you this,
and yet, you know yourself,

208
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,999
security is operation.

209
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,935
Security is step one,
it's the fundamental part

210
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,670
of building something,
rather than, oh,

211
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,041
we'll make something secure
after we construct it.

212
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,776
So don't give up.

213
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,947
It's your responsibility and
your opportunity to do things.

214
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,019
Oh! It came on for a moment.

215
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,353
Went off, oh, it's on!

216
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,787
Great, thank you!

217
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,591
Oh, splendid! Auto.

218
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,694
Come, please, please, please.

219
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,262
You can finish my talk for me.

220
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,497
(audience laughing)

221
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,966
- It's gonna take a
little while here.

222
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,234
- Don't worry about it.

223
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,002
I appreciate it.
- No worries.

224
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,438
- I dug myself into the hole.

225
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,540
Oh, wonderful! Terrific!

226
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,909
There's even light.

227
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,644
On the subject of ...

228
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,984
It'll be here.

229
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,620
On the subject of ...

230
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,858
Publishing, it was.

231
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,630
I figured early on, I
would publish an article

232
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,399
in the communications
of the ACM,

233
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,536
the communications of
the Association for
Computer Machinery

234
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,639
entitled Stalking
the Wily Hacker,

235
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,608
and I thought this was
all you needed to do

236
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,977
is present the facts to people

237
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,880
and everyone else
would learn from it!

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,751
I had the bizarre delusion
that if you told people

239
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,554
the facts of what
had happened to you,

240
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,189
how somebody broke
into your computer

241
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,689
and how you caught them

242
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,795
that that would be enough to
show and convince people that

243
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,063
oh, things are okay.

244
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,399
I was dead wrong, of course.

245
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:26,338
One of the more useful things
is to actually speak to people

246
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:29,175
and tell stories
about what's happened.

247
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,609
For those of you
who are considering

248
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,548
speaking at SANS next
year, tell a story.

249
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:39,418
And if you'd like my opinions
on that, ask me later on.

250
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,686
So, still dead?

251
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,656
Okay, don't worry.

252
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,397
In August of 1986, I was
an astronomer working on

253
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,634
developing off-axes hyperboloids

254
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:59,138
for a large telescope they
were building out of Berkeley.

255
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,974
And the project
ran out of money.

256
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,909
Actually, the project was
funded which meant that

257
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,845
everything was
going to get built

258
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:10,015
and upon building
and construction,
science was no longer.

259
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,991
After things started building,
there was not much need for

260
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:22,528
physical astronomers to
work there on the thing.

261
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,331
So I began working
half-time and then full-time

262
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,733
at the computer lab at
Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

263
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,904
Our labs at the time had a
handful of Unix computer systems

264
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,141
called SPARCstations,
Unix boxes,

265
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,545
and a handful of larger
systems which had

266
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,218
systems like, oh, IBM
time sharing and VAX/VMS.

267
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,356
And I was there for
a day or two when,

268
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,727
when there's a ...

269
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:01,000
They're working with a bunch
of other computer jocks

270
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,572
when one of them comes up to
me and says, hey you know,

271
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,074
the accounting program in our,

272
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,748
at our lab just went
dead, just went belly up.

273
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,217
And was by no means
obvious what was happening,

274
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,718
it was by no means
obvious what was going on.

275
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,890
It turns out after a few hours
of checking things out that

276
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:31,530
the physics department had
hired a, oh, wow, thank you.

277
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,699
The physics department
had hired a ...

278
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,410
We'd hired an undergraduate

279
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,980
from the University of
California Berkeley.

280
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,452
So we had a bunch of boxes
connected together by ether,

281
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,156
with bunch of modems,

282
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,728
X.25, the third Cisco
router ever built.

283
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,868
And when I say a Cisco router,

284
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,439
this was three rack panels wide

285
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,007
and it had eight ports on it.

286
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:20,746
One of the ports went out to
what was called the ARPANET,

287
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:24,850
which went out over to
something called the MILNET.

288
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,185
Oh these things,

289
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:31,056
none of you have heard
of 2400 bond modems,

290
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,025
none of you have heard
of pocket pagers,

291
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,528
none of you have heard
of ARPANET, oh you have.

292
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:40,899
Notice somebody with a gray
beard has heard of that.

293
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,604
You know, the MILENT, these
are figments of history.

294
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,207
When there were
brontosauruses walking around.

295
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,040
Anyway.

296
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,845
Every time somebody used time
on one of these machines,

297
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,015
a packet would come
down into a database

298
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,584
where we would charge
people nickels and dimes

299
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,387
for use of time on the machine.

300
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,557
And one day, this database

301
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,763
went dead in the water so.

302
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,333
I push auto, look at
that, wow, hot damn.

303
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:19,505
So one day this database just
was dead in the water, and

304
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,410
I tried getting hold of this
computer freshman at Berkeley

305
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,178
and he was gone.

306
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,180
And I looked more
carefully at his code

307
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,915
and it turns out that

308
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,487
a user over here, as I recall
by the name of Sventech

309
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,091
had an account name on
one of the Unix boxes,

310
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,628
and didn't have an account
name on the accounting system.

311
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,799
So I remember, oh
this is interesting,
what's going on here?

312
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,168
And I looked carefully.

313
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,203
It turns out they do not
teach error correction

314
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,205
until you're a
sophomore at Berkeley.

315
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,076
So it had never occurred to
him to check to make sure that

316
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,845
there was a valid account
here and a valid account here.

317
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,380
So I patched it.

318
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,048
It turns out that we were
losing on the order of 50,

319
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,685
60, 75 cents of
money through this.

320
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,754
But the real problem was that
the accounting thing was dead.

321
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,589
So ...

322
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,225
Oh, cool.

323
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,797
This is like going
back in memory lane,

324
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:22,367
so I'm sorry for the
tangents, but this was

325
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,838
speaking to the,

326
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,510
this is speaking to my friends
at the NSA 30 years ago.

327
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,716
For this research,
we had no budget.

328
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,087
Our entire computer
security budget, totally,

329
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,723
was one quarter of a
full-time equivalent.

330
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,292
Meaning once a month,
somebody'd write a letter to

331
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,328
our funding agency, the
Department of Energy,

332
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,463
and say we don't
have any problems.

333
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,898
Our hardware budget,

334
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,635
the total hardware and
software budget for this

335
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,872
was zero, well,

336
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,375
corrected for inflation,
zero million dollars.

337
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:06,245
(audience laughing)

338
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,380
All of the funding came
out of the overhead

339
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,716
from our astronomy group.

340
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,918
And there wasn't much overhead.

341
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,221
And we'd rather
be doing physics.

342
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:20,993
Meanwhile, unlike people in
the room, unlike you guys,

343
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:25,364
unlike you people, we had
absolutely zero expertise

344
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,065
in any of this.

345
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,101
So please when you're
sitting back saying,

346
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,036
what a fool this guy was,

347
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:35,507
realize that yes I was
a fool, still am, but

348
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,343
there was none of
the collected wisdom

349
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,812
or even individual
wisdom that you guys have

350
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,548
back 30 years ago.

351
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,982
We had no expertise.

352
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,153
No experience of detecting
anyone breaking in.

353
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,688
We can't publicize things.

354
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,890
We can't go out of what
was then called the Usenet

355
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,792
saying somebody's breaking
into our computer!

356
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,596
Because somebody'll be listening

357
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,966
and they may change their
behavior because of that.

358
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,700
We don't know what other
people are doing because

359
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,636
they shut their mouth.

360
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,772
We have no mandate.

361
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,509
Nobody says it's your job
to track this guy down.

362
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:13,345
A lotta people discouraged
us from continuing.

363
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,516
The Department of Energy said
if it gets in the news that

364
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,086
hackers are breaking
into a DOE computer,

365
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,956
we're gonna cut, Congress
will cut our funding,

366
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,591
we'll double that number
and cut yours, so.

367
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,162
(audience laughing)

368
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,430
What do you do?

369
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,268
Yeah, what do you do
when you're broke,

370
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:39,538
when you're stupid, and
when you're discouraged?

371
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,608
(audience laughing)

372
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:46,778
Now, it seems to me, seems to
me that that's the situation

373
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,682
that we always
find ourselves in.

374
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,285
Think of your own experience.

375
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,955
You never find yourself
with too much money,

376
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:03,328
being too smart, with a huge
mandate, that never happens.

377
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:07,666
There's no client anywhere who's
going to fund you that way.

378
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,135
In other words, you're
doing the right thing.

379
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:14,473
And the result is, you end up
with rather primitive tools.

380
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,442
You use a crescent
wrench as a hammer.

381
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,811
You use a screwdriver
as a chisel.

382
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,649
Your methodology necessarily
has to fit in your budget.

383
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,252
But you come up with
creative solutions.

384
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:31,322
You get people that you know
to do things that are fun.

385
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:36,128
So this kinda summarizes what.

386
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,297
So yeah, what happened?

387
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,533
We detected somebody
deep in our machines

388
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,236
based on a 50, 75
cent accounting error

389
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,572
in our Unix boxes.

390
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,510
Over a period of 11 and
a half or 12 months,

391
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,012
we monitored everything
that the guy did.

392
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:58,582
These were in the days
of RS-232 serial lines,

393
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,620
and things called
dot matrix printer.

394
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,726
Check this out, TV camera
look at this guy here.

395
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,930
Zoom in close, look, look, see?

396
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,932
He knows what a dot
matrix printer is,

397
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,701
like a decorator, remember?

398
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,237
Silence 700s on that
flimsy paper, yeah.

399
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,408
So there was a time when

400
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,343
this was possible to do it.

401
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,413
So, am I gonna mention this?

402
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,416
Yeah, I'll mention
this in a minute.

403
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,421
We printed out
everything that he did.

404
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,757
I mean, I wanted to
hold him in my hand

405
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,226
and find out what's going.

406
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:44,696
We watched him try to break
into about 450 machines.

407
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,866
And they were almost
entirely American military

408
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,135
and defense contractors.

409
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,603
Oh, cool!

410
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,205
Hot damn!

411
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,939
At the time when
I made this thing,

412
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,777
the FBI kept telling me don't
say to anybody where he's from

413
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,412
'cause we're prosecuting him.

414
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:03,315
So I had to make
this viewgraph saying

415
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,283
we traced him back to H.

416
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,819
Well this meant
Hanover, Germany.

417
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,790
We traced the guy back to an
apartment in Hanover, Germany.

418
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,093
A group of five computer
hackers were breaking in.

419
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,797
And we ultimately prosecuted
and convicted this guy

420
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,966
and three others.

421
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:25,137
We contacted organizations
that we thought could help out.

422
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,807
Our funding agency, the
Department of Energy,

423
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,910
which told us stop
tracking him down.

424
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,113
We contacted the FBI.

425
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:39,017
I called up the FBI
Oakland Field Office.

426
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,452
Right, call up, hey FBI,

427
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,953
somebody's breaking
into my computer!

428
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,321
Somebody's screwing
with my computer!

429
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,424
They're breaking
into my systems!

430
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,426
(audience laughing)

431
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,328
I didn't do it this time!

432
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:51,163
It wasn't!

433
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,732
It wasn't me.

434
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,476
So I called the FBI,
and the FBI say,

435
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,211
oh my god, well this
is serious stuff.

436
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,479
Somebody's breaking in,
well what are they doing?

437
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,581
I said, they're getting
into military computers.

438
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,149
They're going
across the ARPANET.

439
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,386
They're CCP/IP,
they're going over the

440
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,389
IP networks, 30 dot,
bluh bluh and 20s.

441
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:21,392
And guy says, oh my god, how
much money have you lost?

442
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,528
And I said, well we've
lost about 75 cents.

443
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:26,598
(audience laughing)

444
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,966
Guy says, look, go away kid.

445
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,803
Come back when you've
lost real money.

446
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:35,140
And that didn't seem like
fun, so over the next,

447
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,241
it's back on?

448
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,577
Over the next ...

449
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,882
Over the next six, eight months?

450
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,919
We contacted every group
that we thought could help.

451
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,090
We called the NSA, the National
Computer Security Center.

452
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:57,395
We called anybody,
Doris Day, B.B. King.

453
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:02,267
Anyone that we thought of,
and the answer was always,

454
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,770
look, we did our best
to tell people about

455
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,310
what was going on and the
inevitable answer was, look.

456
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,151
We would love to hear from you

457
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,954
and we want to read your
logbooks and your reports,

458
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:26,625
and please come out to Fort
Meade and give a talk or three.

459
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,761
But we certainly can't fund you.

460
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,163
We can't do any help for you.

461
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,401
Speaking to the NSA I said,
hey I need a telephone trace

462
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:39,571
across the Atlantic
Ocean into Europe.

463
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,876
The guy says to me, I'm talking
to this guy and he says,

464
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:49,047
look I can't even confirm
that I'm talking to you,

465
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,551
let alone help you out.

466
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,754
And so I'll explore some
of the ways you do this.

467
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,058
Meanwhile, we analyze the
things that the guy's using,

468
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,726
and he's obviously looking

469
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,196
for military targets
and espionage.

470
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,600
And we estimated what
the security was of

471
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,071
North American computer
stock at that time and

472
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,006
not only one in 10, one in 50,

473
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:20,045
more than 1% of all systems
that were connected to

474
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,215
the nascent ARPANET were
extraordinarily vulnerable.

475
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,086
Our reaction.

476
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,389
Our reaction at LBL of
course was have a meeting!

477
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,560
So my boss, Professor Kurth,

478
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,397
and Louis Alvarez,

479
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,032
David Shirley, all
these big shots.

480
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,134
David Shirley was
director of the lab.

481
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,704
He not only had a
beard, but he had a tie,

482
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,938
so he was like important.

483
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,009
And like, we explained
things to him.

484
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,812
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

485
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,282
I sorta missed out on something.

486
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,650
Okay, we'll go back
to, where is it?

487
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,752
Do it by hand.

488
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,793
Going back to this
detailed diagram.

489
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,165
It became fairly obvious
after a couple of weeks

490
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,002
that somebody was coming in
through either our modems

491
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:21,272
or X.25 links into our
local area network.

492
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,808
And it turned out to be,

493
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,844
I was astonished at
how difficult it was

494
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,446
to trace our own
local area networks.

495
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:32,384
They are built to
be undocumented.

496
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,185
People who built
local area networks,

497
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,721
whether it's in their home,
whether it's in their office,

498
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,392
whether it's in an
enterprise, whether it's.

499
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:46,430
They're designed to just barely
work and not be documented!

500
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,235
So I was surprised at
how tough it was to just

501
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,670
draw a block diagram, the
most simplistic diagram,

502
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,774
even to understand
it in my own head.

503
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,011
So the question became one of

504
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,245
how am I going to monitor

505
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:04,482
the 40 or 50 lines
coming into the lab?

506
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,753
And at that point I
took advantage of one

507
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,990
of the very few things that
I learned in graduate school,

508
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,460
namely it's easier
to apologize later

509
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,296
than to get
permission in advance.

510
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,601
I said, I'll wait
until Friday afternoon.

511
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,806
5:30 Friday afternoon, got
one of these lab carts,

512
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,574
you know these push carts,

513
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:33,611
and went from office to
office in Building 50

514
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,513
up at Lawrence Berkeley Labs,

515
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,317
liberating people's desktop
computers and their printers

516
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,654
and their decorators
and their Silent 700s.

517
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,957
Just sort of wheeling
them over to the basement

518
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:50,128
of Building 50 where the glass
room with the dinosaurs were.

519
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,732
And using clip leads
from RadioShack.

520
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,800
Radioshack, does
that exist anymore?

521
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,337
Using clip leads to connect to
the RS-232 lines on the back

522
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,606
so that I had a bunch of ...

523
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:07,212
Printers that essentially
were tapped onto

524
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,646
the incoming lines.

525
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,815
Like about 40 or 50 of these.

526
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,685
So from five o'clock
till 11 o'clock at night,

527
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,154
I was just going around wiring
these up, clipping them,

528
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,890
pins three and one or
something like this,

529
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,625
the back of these connectors.

530
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,861
So that any time somebody
came in over the weekend,

531
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,964
I'd have a print out of
what they were doing.

532
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,533
I got out a sleeping
bag, unrolled it.

533
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,770
Thermos of minestrone soup.

534
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,375
Fell asleep next to
this VAX 780 computer

535
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,978
that was built
during the Civil War.

536
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,548
And the next morning,

537
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:47,085
next morning, it's
a Saturday morning.

538
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,854
Roy Kurth is assistant director,

539
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:53,958
the director of the
physics group comes by and

540
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,728
kicks me out of this
sleeping bag and says,

541
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,063
I understand that people
are missing computers

542
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,932
from around the lab.

543
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:04,536
And I'm in a sleeping bag with
40 or 50 of these computers

544
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,672
surrounding me, and
I tell him the truth.

545
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,707
I have no idea where they are.

546
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,810
(audience laughing)

547
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,179
And he says to me, he
says, it would be a right,

548
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,783
neighborly thing if
they were all returned.

549
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,619
So I said, okay,
so I pick 'em up,

550
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,456
take them to this
little shop, push cart,

551
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:29,627
roll 'em back to their
respective owners, more or less.

552
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,796
And one of them,

553
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,066
one of these things has a,

554
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,368
has like ...

555
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,974
40 or 50 feet of printout
coming out of it.

556
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:44,475
Paper rolling out of it,

557
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:47,779
showing how somebody
has connected

558
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:51,950
through our modem bank, over
our ether into a Unix box,

559
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:57,422
logged in, used a hole in
the post office protocol,

560
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,228
and coupled with crontab
to become a superuser,

561
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,729
to become route,

562
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,532
then to go out over the
ether, through our router,

563
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,301
through our Cisco
box, onto the ARPANET

564
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:13,404
and break into a group at
the Anniston Army Depot

565
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:17,575
and start uploading
information about missile tests

566
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,714
and ICBMs and IRBMs
and things like this.

567
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,148
I'm watching this!

568
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,051
I'm looking at this paper
and seeing all this!

569
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,453
And it's bizarre!

570
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,323
Remember, this is Berkeley.

571
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,858
You might expect
somebody to break in

572
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,961
looking for granola
recipes, but not,

573
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:42,133
not exactly missile tests
and things like this.

574
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,305
I'm saying, this is
absolutely weird.

575
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,241
And over the next
10, 11 months ...

576
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,280
Where's Jennifer? Thank you.

577
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,382
Over the next 10 or 11 months,

578
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,885
we watched this group
of computer hackers

579
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:04,889
routinely searching out
military information,

580
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,992
which of course is weird for me,

581
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,229
having had no contact
whatsoever with the military.

582
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:15,099
Which I'll probably get to
later if there's enough time.

583
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:19,270
Our idea was, so we have this
meeting and Dave Shirley says,

584
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,375
somebody has found
root privilege,

585
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,512
system manage
privilege on our box.

586
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:31,215
We can sort of understand
how we're doing it.

587
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,617
Let's catch 'em.

588
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,320
It's gotta be some
undergraduate in Berkeley.

589
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,956
Track 'em down and catch 'em.

590
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,091
Take all the time,

591
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,162
all the personnel, all
the resources you need.

592
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:47,065
Take three weeks if you
have to, but catch the guy!

593
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,333
Nail the bastard.

594
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,635
And I'm saying, eh
we got three weeks.

595
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,806
So I built systems that today
are laughably primitive.

596
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,813
I got an old Hewlett-Packard
serial line analyzer,

597
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,715
which would just watch,

598
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,751
just looked for binary flips

599
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,320
from zero, one,
zero, one, zero, one.

600
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,024
And match the zero, one, zero,
ones to the ASCII equivalent

601
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:18,196
of the passwords and accounts
that this guy was using.

602
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,501
You know, we all have the
little buttons and tags that say

603
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,902
it's all just zeroes and ones.

604
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,804
Well it was back then also!

605
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,040
And so I just had the serial
line analyzer sitting there

606
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,609
at our ether watching for this,

607
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,181
these transitions, timing
them, and as soon as it said,

608
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:41,252
oh I recognize a username
or a purloined username

609
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,356
or a password that's
associated with these,

610
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,027
it will immediately
pull a mechanical relay.

611
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,466
Once upon a time, electronics
meant transistors and relays,

612
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,735
and things like this.

613
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,671
And the relay in
turn would dial a

614
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,277
mechanical device that
would call a pocket pager

615
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,013
and send a Morse code
signal to a pocket pager.

616
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,516
Once again, no one knows
what a pocket pager, either,

617
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,118
except you, but uh.

618
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,256
And he's about to retire,
so, again this is.

619
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,226
(audience laughing)

620
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,295
Meanwhile, we're printing
out whatever he does.

621
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,397
If there's danger, I'm
going to disconnect him.

622
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,768
If he types in something
like remove all files or

623
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:34,172
wipe our disk, I'm
going to kick him off.

624
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,639
We're going to increase backups

625
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,208
to be once an hour and so on.

626
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,709
We're gonna notify
the authorities.

627
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:41,245
We're gonna tell people,
of course we told the FBI,

628
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,746
we'll notify other
sites directly.

629
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,581
I remember calling ...

630
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:50,654
I distinctly remember calling
the Air Force Space Command

631
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,357
in Los Angeles or San Diego

632
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,828
and having a bizarre
conversation with them,

633
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,564
explaining to them that
somebody was, at the moment,

634
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,899
using their system
and breaking into it.

635
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:05,203
And the system manager saying,
how do I know it's not you?

636
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,404
How can I trust you?

637
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,039
I haven't the faintest
idea who you are.

638
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:12,210
Meanwhile, correctly, I had
no idea who this guy was.

639
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,379
There was a
surprising difficulty

640
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,850
in communicating with others.

641
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,750
Meanwhile, why
keep things silent?

642
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,253
Protect the users.

643
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,457
Yeah, watching this
one guy, we watched him

644
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,026
try to break into several
hundred MILNET machines,

645
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,528
stolen network user.

646
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,464
He kill processes, changed
data, and export files.

647
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,502
He'd kill any auditing or
accounting processes as he went.

648
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,239
His idea was, I do not
want to be discovered.

649
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:47,111
Today, it's commonplace to
talk about password cracking.

650
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,746
All of us are familiar with it.

651
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:52,250
I hadn't ever heard
of this in 1986.

652
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,386
It was completely
novel to me that

653
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,721
here he's cracking the most,

654
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,259
you know, I never thought of.

655
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,963
Also at the time,
the Unix standard for

656
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,933
the Etsy password file was
to make the password file

657
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,170
publicly readable without salt.

658
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,007
It relied entirely upon a
high quality hash function

659
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,708
for password protection.

660
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:22,380
And as, I assume
all of you know,

661
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,683
as I learned eventually, this
is a stupid thing to do but,

662
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,386
to rely upon a single
level of defense

663
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,455
for your most precious file.

664
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,958
We watched the guy
build Trojan horses.

665
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:38,262
Meanwhile he's searching for,
what was in the mid '80s,

666
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:39,997
interesting styles of

667
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,435
military keywords.

668
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,839
We watched this guy
successfully break into

669
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:52,076
a large number of, what I
thought at the time was,

670
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,245
a large number of systems.

671
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:01,118
It was a challenge to get
these people to cooperate,

672
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,721
let alone coordinate
their efforts with us.

673
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,759
It was also challenging
to actually define,

674
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,728
what do you mean by
breaking into a computer?

675
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,965
Is getting guest
privilege interesting?

676
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:18,402
Is getting system manager,
root privilege of importance?

677
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,405
Is it important simply that
you're able to read a few files

678
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,507
or read all files?

679
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,677
The language for intrusion
and intrusion detection

680
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,646
didn't exist at the time.

681
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:29,914
So early on ...

682
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,620
I should go faster.

683
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,421
I'm sorry, I'll try to run
through this fast because

684
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,890
the interesting
conclusions are coming up.

685
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,558
We traced things through
our local area network,

686
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,063
through Tymnet which was an
X.25 packet, packet aggregator.

687
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:47,732
Tymnet to Pac Bell.

688
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,468
Neither Tymnet nor Pac
Bell exist anymore.

689
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,037
We traced things through Pac
Bell through AT&T long lines

690
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,606
to a place in McLean, Virginia.

691
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,642
The place in McLean,
Virginia turned out to be

692
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,676
a defense contractor
called MITRE,

693
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,413
which was an offshoot
of MIT earlier.

694
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,915
And we had problems
getting court orders.

695
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,552
Our court orders in
California to do phone traces

696
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:12,490
were simply not valid
within northern Virginia.

697
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,729
Eventually, we were
able to convince,

698
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:23,401
we were able to convince the
Virginia Telephone System

699
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:27,571
to help us out by simply
talking to a network operator

700
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,342
in Virginia and
saying, hey look,

701
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,212
I need to know where
this line traces back to.

702
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,747
The guy says, well I
can't help you out.

703
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,214
Sorry, show me your court order.

704
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,750
I said I can't show
you a court order

705
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,118
'cause it's in California.

706
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,587
However, I do have
some wonderful pictures

707
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,123
of galaxies and
planets that come from

708
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,658
my astronomy background.

709
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:52,363
And the guy said, that'll do
and so. (audience laughing)

710
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,031
So I sent him a bunch of
really cool pictures of

711
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,069
Saturn and Jupiter and
the Andromeda Galaxy.

712
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,805
And we found out
that it was MITRE.

713
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,573
We call up MITRE.

714
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,208
MITRE Titan Security
immediately,

715
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:08,045
by simply switching off
their outbound modems.

716
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:11,214
I'll get to the useful stuff.

717
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,485
This is the kinda block
diagrams that you people are,

718
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:16,187
I'm certain.

719
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,689
You know somebody
in Hanover, Germany

720
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,156
makes a connection over,

721
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:23,127
what was then the German
telephone service.

722
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,831
Calls up into a PAD, a public
access dial up network.

723
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,167
Goes over the Datex-P network.

724
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,871
Across through a satellite into
a North American aggregator.

725
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,339
Into our labs in Berkeley.

726
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,941
Then goes out over the Internet,

727
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,109
what was then
called the ARPANET,

728
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,912
goes to one military computer
to another to another.

729
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:43,413
Extracts information from this.

730
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:47,485
Good luck if you're down
here and you detect this guy.

731
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,453
Good luck trying to trace
it all the way back.

732
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:52,223
It takes effort
and coordination,

733
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,859
and it was a.

734
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:06,203
In detail, it was necessary.

735
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,041
The curious thing about
all of these diagrams

736
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,778
is not that they're
of interest to you,

737
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:18,115
but that it's necessary to
make this kind of diagram

738
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,685
when you speak to
your customers.

739
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,622
Because simply saying,

740
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,857
oh IP network 20.7.7.13

741
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,530
doesn't communicate the
same thing as saying oh,

742
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,965
you are right here, friend.

743
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,234
And the person's back here.

744
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,838
As much as possible,

745
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,841
simplify honestly,

746
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,680
and make your point as
visible as you possibly can.

747
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,921
This made sense to my
customers who happened,

748
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,857
ultimately, to be FBI agents.

749
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:03,961
And the sharper ones were
literally fresh out of college.

750
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:04,962
So you know.

751
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,066
So meanwhile,

752
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,238
we traced things from our
labs in Lawrence Berkeley Labs

753
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,739
to Bremen, Germany.

754
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,643
And Bremen, Germany, at the
time Bremen, West Germany,

755
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:25,115
there was a MicroVAX sitting
in a librarian's office

756
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:29,386
that had a connection to
another computer in Hanover.

757
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,957
And so a distance of
150 kilometers between

758
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,196
here and here, somebody
had successfully converted

759
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:43,400
this Bremen computer into
an open enough computer

760
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,236
that hackers could
break it and use that

761
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:49,406
to connect to North American
sites, and hide behind it.

762
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:55,212
Then at the Hanover
Public Access Dial Up PAD,

763
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:59,617
we were able to trace things
back to Hanover, Germany.

764
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,819
But this was.

765
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:04,822
Ah! Remember.

766
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:13,163
None of you need listen,
but he'll understand.

767
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:16,166
There was a time, no
kidding, there was a time

768
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,670
when the word telephone
meant a thing that

769
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,540
was on your desk,
and it was about uh,

770
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,342
size of a bread box or so.

771
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,111
And there was a
wire leading to it.

772
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:30,446
The word wireless hadn't
been invented yet.

773
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,883
And to make a telephone call,

774
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,919
is this true?

775
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,520
Look, look at what he's doing!

776
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,322
Look at what he's doing.

777
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:39,823
To make a telephone call,

778
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,560
you put your finger in
this thing called a?

779
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,295
It's called a dial, yeah a ring.

780
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,096
You put your finger in
this thing goes zuh!

781
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,432
And go
click-click-click-click-click-c!

782
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,935
Zuh! Click-click-click
no kidding.

783
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,437
It was mechanical!

784
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,975
Ask him! (audience laughing)

785
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,177
He thinks I'm kidding!

786
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,680
You would make a telephone
call by going zuh!

787
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,281
Click-click-click-zuh!
Zz-zz-zz-zz-zuh!

788
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:09,587
10, 20, 30 kilometers
away in downtown Hanover,

789
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:14,191
there'd be solenoids and
relays and little clicky things

790
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,459
that would go zuh!

791
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,594
Click-click-click-click-click!

792
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,195
Zuh! Zz-zz-zz-zz-zuh!

793
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,497
Zoop! Zz-zz-zz-zz-zuh!

794
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,067
It was all electromechanical.

795
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,269
There were no computers.

796
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,372
I have no idea how
the system worked.

797
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,642
I mean, if it worked, even.

798
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,577
You can't believe that.

799
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,715
I know, ask him!

800
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,584
He'll tell you, it's true.

801
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,252
You couldn't pick it up walk
around with it like this.

802
00:43:43,253 --> 00:43:47,257
You know, it was like 20
times bigger than this.

803
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,428
In Hanover, Germany this meant

804
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,330
that to make a telephone trace,

805
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,834
you had to do in real time.

806
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,203
Because when you hung
up and disconnected,

807
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,605
all the solenoids, throoomp!

808
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,774
Went back to neutral.

809
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,844
And to make a phone trace,
you had to have a human being

810
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,447
with a ohmmeter and
a voltmeter and a,

811
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,950
and a notepad and a clipboard.

812
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,355
And all of this took several
hours to get to work.

813
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:23,293
So we needed a phone
trace that would take

814
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:26,296
two or three hours to complete.

815
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:30,466
And repeatedly, we'd discover
the guy on our system,

816
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,971
we'd call the FBI,
the FBI would call the

817
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,773
German Bundeskriminalamt.

818
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,943
The Bundeskriminalamt would
call the Deutsch Bundespost.

819
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,647
And they'd send technicians
out to make this trace,

820
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,616
and by the time they got
to the downtown Hanover

821
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,817
telephone box,

822
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,689
thing had been disconnected.

823
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,524
So we needed a way to,

824
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,896
we needed a way to keep
this hacker connected

825
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,031
for two or three hours.

826
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:01,865
And...

827
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,170
How much time do I have?

828
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:10,574
All I want, thanks.

829
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,643
How much time, quick, quick.

830
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:13,844
- [Man] You go into
break real quick.

831
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,646
- A little bit, but how
much time do I have?

832
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,480
- [Man] 30 minutes!

833
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,715
- 30 minutes, okay.

834
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,750
Can I talk about this
or should I skip it?

835
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,684
- [Man] You can do that one.

836
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,753
- Okay, do it, okay, okay.

837
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,723
This is the only useful.

838
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,593
So far, everything I've
told you is either obvious,

839
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:34,263
wrong, or so antique that
no one would care about it.

840
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:36,867
So this is the only useful thing

841
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,403
that I have to tell you so far.

842
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,272
And the coolest, oh I'm far out,

843
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:46,442
the coolest of it is some
of you may have kids who are

844
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,446
at the age where they're
learning to play chess,

845
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,316
or better yet some of
you may be playing chess.

846
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,149
And ...

847
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,856
Wouldn't it be cool
to win at chess?

848
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:02,960
Wouldn't it be absolutely
sweet to always win at chess?

849
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:08,832
Would it not be wonderful
to like, like, like, like

850
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,168
always win at chess?

851
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:14,972
This guy, Arthur Pisguier,
Arthur Pisguier is,

852
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,676
I mean, he's not just
your ordinary grandmaster,

853
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:22,513
he's an international
grandmaster.

854
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,417
He has 10 tips on
how to win at chess.

855
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,685
He's gonna teach me and you

856
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,089
how to win at chess.

857
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,794
And it turns out,
all you need to know

858
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,395
is rule number two.

859
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,831
And it turns out,

860
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:47,738
a division of mathematical
graph theory called game theory

861
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,111
suggests strongly that game
theory is highly applicable

862
00:46:55,946 --> 00:47:00,217
in computer science,
especially in the type of work

863
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,686
that I see vendors doing.

864
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,857
Things like log analysis
and patch management tools.

865
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:12,696
Game theory is a surprisingly
useful tool in doing this

866
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,232
type of thing, so
think about that.

867
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,067
Here's a grandmaster
who's gonna teach you

868
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,737
how to always win at chess!

869
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,674
And all you need to
know is rule number two!

870
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,442
Is that cool or what?

871
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,013
You wanna win at chess,

872
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,283
make the best possible move.

873
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:36,286
(audience laughing)

874
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:44,528
For those of you of
the female persuasion,

875
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,296
rule number four is also useful.

876
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,300
(audience laughing)

877
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,473
So it was January of 1987 when

878
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,676
I came across this.

879
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:00,477
And my ...

880
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:06,884
My sweetheart at the
time, she and I were,

881
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,052
did I already mention this?

882
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,721
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

883
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,589
At the time, the west
coast was going through

884
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,591
one of its periodic droughts.

885
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,861
And she and I were
conserving water together.

886
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,196
And in the words of the,

887
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:23,934
in the words of the
Oakland Tribune,

888
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,471
Stoll and his sweetheart were
in the shower together one day

889
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,840
when they came up with the
answer that they dubbed

890
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,808
Operation Showerhead.

891
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,311
They would create
a very large file,

892
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,648
full of completely bogus
information about the topics

893
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,983
that they knew the
hacker was interested in.

894
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,152
The time that he
spent downloading it

895
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,487
would give them,

896
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:47,524
would give the police
time to track him down.

897
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,326
We tried to make the files

898
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,296
look really
bureaucratic and boring.

899
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,964
This girlfriend said,
look if we had said,

900
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:55,999
hey this is classified
information,

901
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,769
the guy would've
caught on right away.

902
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,169
The trick worked.

903
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,807
The hacker came across the file
and spent more than an hour

904
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,542
loading it into
his own computer.

905
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,444
During that time, the German
police were able to trace

906
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,446
his telephone number
and ultimately find

907
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,647
where he lived and so on.

908
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,283
Stoll and his girlfriend
celebrated with

909
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,653
milkshakes made from homegrown
Berkeley strawberries.

910
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,486
So.

911
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,791
Essentially, we.

912
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,496
This is so cool to discover
these viewgraphs from

913
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,564
last century.

914
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,467
We needed a one hour connection.

915
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,035
We needed this guy to
be connected for an hour

916
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:35,172
in order to make this
mechanical phone trace.

917
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,740
So we created files about

918
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,875
the strategic defense
initiative network.

919
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,812
This was a big
thing in the 1980s

920
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,681
and today it's been completely
forgotten along with,

921
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,416
you know, like disco.

922
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:53,490
These files about SDI Network
contained bureaucratic memos,

923
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,892
vague descriptions of
this utterly boring

924
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:01,365
phony military
network, form letters,

925
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,966
names of a non-existent
secretary that happened to have

926
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:06,603
the same mail stop as me.

927
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:10,674
January 16, the guy broke
in and read these files.

928
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,110
These files were
not world readable.

929
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,347
You know, you set your
permissions correctly.

930
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,815
We traced this particular
connection all the way

931
00:50:18,815 --> 00:50:20,817
back to a particular telephone.

932
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,186
I'm in the backyard, we're
dancing around singing,

933
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,654
ding dong, the witch is dead,

934
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,889
having the great time saying

935
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,091
I can go back to
doing astronomy,

936
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,759
it'll be all over now.

937
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,330
But the German's
Bundeskriminalamt,
they're clever.

938
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,165
They're not like
me, they're clever.

939
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,933
They wait for a week.

940
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,745
This is the type of thing
that we placed in our system.

941
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:52,214
This is one of dozens of such

942
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,452
completely bogus documents
that we thought up.

943
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,721
Each of you could do
a better job of this.

944
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,457
Remember, I'm just a physicist.

945
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,993
SDI Network Project,
LBL Mail Stop 50-351,

946
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,863
1 Cyclotron Road,
Berkeley California 94720.

947
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,499
Name name, address, state,
city, state, code, country.

948
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:12,035
Dear sir, notice
the vaguely sexist

949
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,104
bureaucratic-sounding language.

950
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,073
Thank you for you
inquiry about Sdinet.

951
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,307
We're happy to comply
with your request

952
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,176
about more information
about this network.

953
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:21,178
The following documents are
available from this office.

954
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,647
Please state which
you want sent to you.

955
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:26,549
Does anybody recognize
the word More, M-O-R-E?

956
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,418
Unix jocks, anyone?

957
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,854
Today, this has
been made obsolete

958
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,756
and everyone uses the
Unix command Less,

959
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,392
which is. (audience laughing)

960
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,495
But this is, less
is more, thank you.

961
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:44,101
So available on our,
if you write to us,

962
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,138
is document 37.6 SDI Net
Overview Description Document,

963
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,740
41.7 Functional
Requirements Document,

964
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,676
45.2 Strategic
Defense Initiative and
Computer Networking.

965
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:57,047
In other words, this
is the kind of bogus,

966
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,550
this is the kind of
boring, bureaucratic crud

967
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,453
that you'll find in
every organization.

968
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:08,391
And you generate it by taking
the boring, bureaucratic crud

969
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:11,628
and croft that's already
in your organization,

970
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,663
and just tweaking
it a little bit.

971
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,332
I noticed, you know.

972
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:21,271
For us, we had this

973
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,941
interesting mapping
function from

974
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,945
academia into the
military language.

975
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,047
We had a genuine problem.

976
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,118
I talked a number of times
to a guy named Jim Kristy

977
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,823
at the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations, OSI.

978
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,125
I had no idea who they
are, what they are,

979
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,994
what the initials stand for.

980
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,664
There was a place
called Bolling ...

981
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,399
Yeah, Bolling Air Force Base.

982
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,903
And I have no idea
whether this is,

983
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,837
where it is or what it is and
I don't know the difference

984
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,642
between a colonel and a
general or anything like this.

985
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,077
But there has to be
a mapping function

986
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,513
that will map it into my mind.

987
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,715
My mind has an
academic bureaucracy,

988
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,419
starting at dean, working
your way down to professor,

989
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,054
to grad student,
undergrad and so on.

990
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,323
So all I had to do was take

991
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,127
ordinary university
documents and change

992
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:21,865
professor into colonel
and dean into general,

993
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,535
and grad student
into lieutenant.

994
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:30,540
And it maps very sweetly
between the two bureaucracies.

995
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:34,177
So blah blah blah blah blah.

996
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,779
Because of the length
of these documents,

997
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,081
we must use a postal
service, blah blah blah,

998
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,218
sincerely yours Mrs. Barbara
Sherwin, Document Secretary,

999
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,886
Sdinetwork project.

1000
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,057
This is the kind of crud
that this guy downloaded.

1001
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,363
So the Bundeskriminalamt
sits and waits for a month,

1002
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:54,864
two, three months.

1003
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,301
And the guy keeps
breaking into our systems.

1004
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:01,304
Then three months after
this goes out over the ether

1005
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,307
into West Germany,
a letter arrives.

1006
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,577
No kidding.

1007
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,012
A letter arrives.

1008
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:14,951
A paper letter, this was
before email was common,

1009
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:18,088
a paper letter arrives
from Triam International.

1010
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,191
6512 Ventura Drive,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1011
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,426
April 21st, 1987.

1012
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:26,296
Addressed to the SDI
Network mail stop,

1013
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,932
you know LBL Mail
Shop five, you know.

1014
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,399
1 Cyclotrov Road.

1015
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,070
He misspelled Cyclotron
and he misspelled Berkeley.

1016
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,007
But this is my mail box.

1017
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,743
Dear Mrs. Sherwin,

1018
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:40,944
I'm interested in the
following documents.

1019
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,212
Please send me a price list

1020
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,980
and an update on the
SDI Network problem.

1021
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,181
Thank you for your cooperation.

1022
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,350
Very truly yours, Laszlo Balogh.

1023
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,453
And this guy's looking for
document 37.6 SDI Network

1024
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,055
Overview Description Document.

1025
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,423
You know, 41.7.

1026
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:56,926
Looking at this, comparing it to

1027
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:00,330
the one that fell on the floor
and I'm saying, oh my god.

1028
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,833
All of the stuff that went
over to somebody in Germany

1029
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,802
who's been looking for
this military stuff

1030
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:10,240
is somebody in Pittsburgh
with a Bulgarian last name

1031
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,640
is picking up on.

1032
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,812
So I did what you would do.

1033
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,315
Did exactly what you would do.

1034
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,319
I called the FBI.

1035
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,889
It's like call the FBI.

1036
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,858
And the guy at the
FBI says, oh my god!

1037
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,127
Whatever you do,
don't touch that!

1038
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:31,961
Blah!

1039
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:39,134
Don't touch it because it's
got fingerprints on it.

1040
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,142
Get an 11 by 14
Glacene envelope.

1041
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,080
Pair of latex gloves.

1042
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,849
And go pick that up.

1043
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,086
But no no no no no
no no no no no no!

1044
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,254
Don't pick it up
from around the edges

1045
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,692
like an intelligent
person would do.

1046
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,862
Pick it up by the
middle like this,

1047
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,232
'cause the fingerprints
are around the edge!

1048
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:12,000
And holding it with
your latex glove on,

1049
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,804
you're holding it like this.

1050
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,608
And you're trying to get
into this envelope, right?

1051
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,777
So you're going like,
voo-voo-voo-voop!

1052
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:25,382
And so, you finally get
into this Glacene envelope,

1053
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,785
you put it into a Federal
Express overnight envelope,

1054
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,221
and send it to the
FBI crime headquarters

1055
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,889
in Washington, D.C.

1056
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,792
So I bicycle down
to downtown Berkeley

1057
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,427
where the FedEx boxes.

1058
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:41,498
I'm going along as fast as I
can and entirely by accident,

1059
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,767
I bumped into a Xerox machine,

1060
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,335
which is why I've got
a copy of it today.

1061
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,338
(audience laughing)

1062
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:50,607
So ...

1063
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,009
So ...

1064
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,413
All of which,

1065
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,182
oh.

1066
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:01,984
Cool.

1067
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:06,522
(laughing)

1068
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,859
I'm sorry, along with
this packet of ...

1069
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:15,698
Detritus in my attic came a note

1070
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,701
that I scribbled.

1071
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,173
All of which actually
comes down to,

1072
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:26,375
hey kids, for mind blowing
glimpses of reality

1073
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,579
as it really is, don't
miss The Cuckoo's Egg

1074
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,116
by Cliff Stoll, graduate of
Buffalo Public School '61.

1075
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,919
Published by Doubleday,
the purveyors of the finest

1076
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,720
in computer
counterespionage books

1077
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,221
for the general public,.

1078
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:43,660
On sale at most good stores
and all crummy bookstores.

1079
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,395
So much for a plug for the book.

1080
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,465
If you buy a copy
of that book today,

1081
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:53,903
a nickel of that will go
to my kid's tuition fund.

1082
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:59,476
Which is to say if
you can possibly

1083
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,312
find it in your heart
to buy 200,000 of them.

1084
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,315
(audience laughing)

1085
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,486
My wife and I will
be grateful to you

1086
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,721
for the next several years.

1087
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,459
How much time do I have?

1088
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,194
Seriously, how many minutes?

1089
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,128
10 minutes.

1090
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:29,572
I'd like to show
you a picture of my

1091
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:33,743
wife, Pat, and my daughter,
Zoe, but I'm not going to.

1092
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,779
Instead what I'll do is

1093
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:41,718
mention to you that these
viewgraphs and so on,

1094
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:45,888
I made for a talk
that I gave at the NSA

1095
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,827
in 1987, 1988.

1096
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:55,765
And there are a few, very
few, things to take away.

1097
00:58:55,765 --> 00:58:58,634
One of them was they told me,

1098
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,470
look we'd like you to do a talk,

1099
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,573
but we're not going to allow
our audience to ask questions.

1100
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:08,745
Because we don't want you to
know what we are interested in.

1101
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:15,785
Sorta has some interesting
epistemological implications.

1102
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,957
So could you address
the following questions?

1103
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,793
How was the penetrator tracked?

1104
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:27,096
Which so far I hope
I've answered this.

1105
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,932
What auditing features exist?

1106
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,167
Well the auditing
features consist of

1107
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:36,038
a lousy, 150-line C
program that a freshman

1108
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,974
at University of
California wrote

1109
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,442
that has lots of holes in it.

1110
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,011
How do you audit somebody
with system level privileges?

1111
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,514
This gets interesting,
and I note that there are

1112
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,151
several vendors in the hallway
that address this directly

1113
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:52,288
by auditing not what's
happening on the system,

1114
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:56,693
but rather by looking
at what I call TCP dump

1115
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,695
Wireshark types of logs.

1116
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:04,767
And I find this, you know,
but this is 30 years later.

1117
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,971
Supply technical details on
how to penetrate computers.

1118
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,305
How were passwords obtained

1119
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,307
for the Lawrence
Livermore Crays systems?

1120
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,477
How were superuser
privileges obtained?

1121
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,814
Did the penetrator
guard against detection?

1122
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,149
These were questions
asked of me 30 years ago

1123
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,651
to give a talk on.

1124
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,623
Well I saw these
questions and I found.

1125
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,458
If they want me, an
academic from Berkeley

1126
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,960
to go to Fort Meade and
give a talk on this,

1127
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,431
and I found the questions
to be damn defensive.

1128
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,867
But not for the obvious reason.

1129
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:40,937
For a much more subtle reason.

1130
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:45,107
There's something wrong with
each of these questions.

1131
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,546
And the subtle problem
with each question,

1132
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,982
I implore each of you
to ask of yourself.

1133
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:59,656
What's wrong with these
questions is not their content,

1134
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,225
but rather their phraseology.

1135
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:05,962
Each of these questions
is a morally neutral,

1136
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:12,000
passive voice question, where
the active party is hidden,

1137
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:17,507
where the active question
itself is obscured.

1138
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:25,080
Once you recognize
that and you say,

1139
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:29,619
oh let me rephrase this into
questions that make sense

1140
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:33,356
to Cliff, you get
things like this.

1141
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,626
How does this bastard
break into computers?

1142
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,661
What systems does
he slither into?

1143
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,231
How does this scoundrel
become superuser?

1144
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,667
How did the son of a bitch
get the Cray computers?

1145
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:47,770
Did the skunk guard
against detection?

1146
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,339
How do you audit a varmint
who's system manager?

1147
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:54,277
And how do you trace an
eggsucker back to his roost?

1148
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:57,814
In other words, this is
the kind of question,

1149
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:01,850
this is the kind of
question I can understand.

1150
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:05,988
Because it implies a
moral and ethical question

1151
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,524
that there is
indeed in our life,

1152
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:12,127
and in our profession,
a right and a wrong.

1153
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:19,468
By erasing the concept of
ethics and morality and evil,

1154
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:25,441
you get this kind of
moral neutral jibbergash

1155
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:28,444
that we find so
often in PowerPoint.

1156
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:33,216
When you're asking
this kind of question.

1157
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:38,488
When you're asking
that kind of question,

1158
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:41,591
you check in at nine a.m.,
you check out at five p.m.

1159
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,093
You're asking this,
you're in a sleeping bag

1160
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,964
on a Friday night with a thermos
of minestrone next to you.

1161
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:53,136
And of course, all of these
lead to the obvious question.

1162
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,572
Why do we still work
on this problem?

1163
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:57,840
Why do we care?

1164
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,279
And to me, this is the point,

1165
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:07,750
this is the torch that I
feel is in each of your hands

1166
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,052
because it's no
longer in my hands.

1167
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:13,256
We care because we're
members of a community.

1168
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:17,460
And it's a community not
bound together by databases.

1169
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,096
It's not a community
that's bound together

1170
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,699
by knowing how Python scripts
use dictionary look ups.

1171
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,770
It's not a community that
is bound together because

1172
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,038
oh, we know how to do
this intrusion detection,

1173
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,341
we know how to do Wireshark.

1174
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,779
No, it's a community tied
together by common interests

1175
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:41,017
of promoting the free,
or the not so free,

1176
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:44,153
transfer of information
legitimately

1177
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,355
between our different
individuals,

1178
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,357
our different organizations,
our different companies,

1179
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,326
our different universities.

1180
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,562
This is our responsibility.

1181
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:58,034
This is who we are, this
is who we should be.

1182
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,737
And for that reason,
I implore you

1183
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:06,509
to use the active
voice in your universe.

1184
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:09,579
Because you're in it.

1185
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:13,182
When you write things,
when you speak,

1186
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:17,252
use the word I, use the
word me, use the word us.

1187
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:24,727
When you hear passive voice,
of course all of us know,

1188
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,196
when you hear somebody
speaking in passive voice,

1189
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:31,133
it's a way to dodge
responsibility.

1190
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,536
Enough said there.

1191
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,137
I'll just go over, you know,

1192
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,639
how does he break
into computers.

1193
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:37,840
It was obvious.

1194
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,675
Where'd he get into,
blah blah blah.

1195
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:40,943
You know, how did he get this?

1196
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,279
You know, well he reads
command files, you know.

1197
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,448
Guard against detection? Yeah.

1198
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,982
All of these, all of you know.

1199
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,385
You know, why do we still
work on this problem?

1200
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,953
Damned if I know.

1201
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,889
I'm a physicist.

1202
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,126
Your job, peoples, if
you're doing the job right,

1203
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:59,395
if you're doing your job right,

1204
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,731
I'll never hear from you!

1205
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,967
If you guys are
doing your job right,

1206
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:06,836
my system is secure!

1207
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,272
And it's secure
transparently to me.

1208
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:12,375
I don't have to stand on my head

1209
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,243
and enter three
levels of passwords

1210
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:15,711
that have my cellphone go beep.

1211
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:19,881
No, quality security
is invisible

1212
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:22,218
to an ordinary user like me.
