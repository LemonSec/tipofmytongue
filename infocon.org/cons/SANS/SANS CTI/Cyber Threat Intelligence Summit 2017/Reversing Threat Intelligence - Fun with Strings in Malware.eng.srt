[Applause]

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,969
thank you and thank you Matt for that

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,829
introduction I hope this doesn't suck so

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:17,869
hopefully I say up to your guys's

6
00:00:15,829 --> 00:00:19,280
expectations and the funny thing with

7
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,800
the person who hacked my account I

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,150
actually found him like two months ago I

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,890
say him a message and everything I was

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:27,169
like hey were you or that guy he's like

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:31,010
oh my god it was like a blast of the

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,450
past for him so they pile on my talk and

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,309
it's funny because he's not in the

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,660
industry he doesn't do anything with

15
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,940
malware I think it was like a developer

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,620
or something now so the title of my talk

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,928
is reversing threat intelligence

18
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,358
fundable strings in now we're the cool

19
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:47,480
thing with this talk is when I gave my

20
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:49,100
first securities presentation the title

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,010
was funny with strings of malware gave

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,870
it a local ocol place here called the

23
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:56,780
Nova hacker so shout out to those folks

24
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,339
there so a little bit about me my name

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,350
is Ronnie togas I'll ski

26
00:00:58,339 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm a senior malware analyst with with

27
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,849
flash point used to be with fish me now

28
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,759
a flash point as Matt pointed out the

29
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,520
stuff I did with VEC you can find it

30
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,820
over there with fish me I like to hack

31
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,789
things I also like to tweet a lot so my

32
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,889
handle is I heart malware I also like

33
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,549
cooking as well so I'd like to in

34
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,579
kombucha

35
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,149
I like making real barbecue aka North

36
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:28,880
Carolina style pulled pork the Texans in

37
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:32,689
the room just cringed sorry now I'm out

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,969
but I'll busted I'll work on the BAC

39
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,229
side if you guys see it and want to

40
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,509
start collaborating on some of this

41
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,009
stuff hit me up afterward I'll be I'll

42
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:41,930
be at the booth at the flashpoint booth

43
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:44,270
after that do a lot of work with crime

44
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,909
whereas well I have also done like apt

45
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,259
in my past life as well as I'm trolling

46
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,619
the attackers which is just something

47
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,880
that's a whole lot of fun to do so I'm

48
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,789
what I'm gonna do in this presentation

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,490
is I'm gonna go over the deep and dark

50
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:01,609
web and no it's not something from mr.

51
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:03,259
robot or some other CSI thing where it's

52
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,699
just a buzz word but there's actually

53
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,799
more context too and it makes more sense

54
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,689
then

55
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,060
than the buzzword I'm gonna go ahead and

56
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,280
define malware for you guys as well as

57
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,890
strings um so I'll go ahead and talk

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,810
about Yara and some stuff on virus Hodel

59
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,429
as well as you how to programmatically

60
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,349
create your are rules and the cool thing

61
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,420
is is the attackers are human and that's

62
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,010
kind of the aspect I want to make clear

63
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,649
for you guys and everything and now go

64
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,769
ahead and close out so what is the deep

65
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,989
and dark web 30 seconds Leo pretty much

66
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,120
if it's a dot onion address or if it's a

67
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,980
forum where you have to be vouched in

68
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,110
order to get on that that's the stuff

69
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,790
we're looking at so you have the attacks

70
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,470
as they come in but this is kind of

71
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,880
looking at the malware as it's being

72
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,400
developed and actively developed they

73
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,480
may not be completely public but it's

74
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,160
one of those things where a lot of the

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,619
stuff that be going over it does tie

76
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,450
back to that and it also is applicable

77
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,980
for other means too so it just kind of

78
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,730
gives you the picture of where that is

79
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,078
so what is malware long story short it's

80
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,459
something that's malicious that you can

81
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,470
go ahead and send back and forth to your

82
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:03,879
user or if you're in the vendor space

83
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,970
it's something that I can sell you a

84
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,880
solution for so as we go as we all know

85
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:12,190
if it's if it's malicious will you can

86
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,590
have this new IDs DLP cyber threats

87
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,750
energy thing also there's clouds and

88
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,269
NextGen's and threat bots so if the

89
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,040
malware is something that can be a

90
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,260
vendor can sell you a solution for

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,760
that's malware so what are strings the

92
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,560
best way to look at it our strings are

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,480
these things that reverse engineers use

94
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,480
in order to make it sound really fancy

95
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,470
but it's actually what we use to cheat

96
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,599
the wit and it's also a way the

97
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,099
attackers communicate and also for what

98
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,030
it's worth this thing here is a string

99
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,910
but the interesting thing with this

100
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,130
string is this is a this is a panda

101
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,720
string so what this panda string likes

102
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,870
is this panda string likes whiskey as

103
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,310
with a V as put earlier but the cool

104
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,019
thing is is this string is actually a

105
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,639
pretty smart string so the interesting

106
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,590
thing is with this string it string

107
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,000
walks into a bar so string walks into

108
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,470
the bar talks to the bartender and says

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,060
hey I get a drink

110
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,859
bartender looks at the string is like no

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,599
you can't have a you can't have a drink

112
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:08,440
you're you're a piece of string I can't

113
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,510
let you do that

114
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,480
so string looks back the bartender is

115
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,409
like okay so walks away so what he does

116
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,339
is he tried he's goes and fills us here

117
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,630
a little bit

118
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:22,780
to try and start hiding his identity

119
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,490
because that's what panda strings do so

120
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,388
he went made his hair a little better

121
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,169
he's like okay I'm gonna go get me a

122
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:28,240
pink this hi

123
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,770
so string walks into the bar next day

124
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,580
and everything and he says hey KY go

125
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,320
ahead and have a drink

126
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,419
so bartender says aren't you that same

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,960
string from the other day he's like yeah

128
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:40,000
so walks back out so he's like this the

129
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,099
Panda string he's like okay I got my

130
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,470
idea I know exactly what I'm gonna do we

131
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,970
do it will be a twist in trying to get

132
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,430
to go and everything so it's like

133
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,710
alright I'm getting my drink now so

134
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,820
swing walks into the bar and everything

135
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,919
it goes up to the bartender says hey

136
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,479
yeah I have a drink bartender looks at

137
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,650
the guy goes he's like aren't you that

138
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,090
same string that was here in the year

139
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,280
the other day and asked me for a drink

140
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,989
the previous two times so he looks at

141
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,919
looks at the bartender he gut says nope

142
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:08,979
afraid not

143
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:11,200
I I heard some groans and I'm sorry for

144
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,909
the boat that corny dad jokes but it's

145
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,250
actually applicable because if you think

146
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,389
about it that string is a is a someone

147
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,010
who's writing now where they're

148
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:20,050
constantly trying to bypass all our

149
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,030
technologies but as analysts we're

150
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,919
looking we're constantly looking at the

151
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,599
at the string and at this things as they

152
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,070
change so that's how we can help tell

153
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,430
that story and start catching the bad

154
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,460
guys so some of the tools is our

155
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,729
analysts that we use we also use Windows

156
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,930
VMs I have if I had a quarter for each

157
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,729
time somebody asks Ronnie what's your

158
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,340
favorite tool to use my number one

159
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,110
favorite tool to use is notepad plus

160
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,090
plus and the reason I like that is

161
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,039
because I can take a binary throw it

162
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,049
into there right-click open it notepad

163
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,300
and it has all this wonderful gibberish

164
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,320
but the cool thing is is you can

165
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,180
actually start looking at how the

166
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,919
different files are set up and how the

167
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,919
format is split up so you can see okay

168
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,659
am i dealing with a foe I dealing with a

169
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,639
Windows executable am i dealing with an

170
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,889
elf binary is this packed is it not

171
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,150
packed is it up who skated some way so

172
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,340
when you start looking at that you can

173
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,950
kind of figure out the different aspects

174
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,229
of that so that's honestly notepad plus

175
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,610
plus is probably what my favorite tools

176
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,560
well my second favorite ones is yaara

177
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,000
just because you can go ahead and create

178
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,039
signatures for stuff that your attacker

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,440
doesn't necessarily think of but you can

180
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,169
tie back the information that they have

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,740
there and then also looking at dotnet

182
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,750
for decompilers because

183
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,789
just great decompiling their source code

184
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,009
and seeing exactly how they wrote it

185
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,240
which will be coming back to that and

186
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:37,340
then my other favorite tool is excellent

187
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,500
research you would be amazed is that how

188
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,530
many tackers to this day still use an X

189
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,250
or just a straight single by the X or in

190
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:48,099
the last six years I constantly see it

191
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,720
even with marah have seen that as well

192
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:52,699
so one of the cool piece of malware I've

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,410
gotten to analyze lately is I've gotten

194
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,550
to look at a lot of the Pro Isis tools a

195
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,430
lot of them out that they've been

196
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,380
writing so if you think about it when we

197
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,849
think of Isis we think of this as some

198
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,080
super sophisticated terrorist group

199
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:04,699
they're getting tons of funding and

200
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,340
they're very hard to stop so it's a big

201
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,199
problem complete opposite of AD so the

202
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,289
attackers who were behind Isis a lot of

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,720
them is a very very rudimentary they had

204
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,340
last week they had a drone and they in

205
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,289
one of their on marketing videos and I

206
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,880
was looking at the drone and I enjoy

207
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,830
flying quad copters so I'm sitting there

208
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,969
looking I'm like that's a 5.8 gigahertz

209
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:27,198
antenna that's a hobby grade remote and

210
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,330
I'm suddenly looking at that drone I'm

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,800
like that drone was maybe like 200 bucks

212
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,008
like I could build something better in

213
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,180
my basement so it's a so for them the

214
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,940
tools and stuff that they were using is

215
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,590
very rudimentary so one of the cool

216
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,380
tools that kit that we came across in

217
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,560
the stuff that we were looking at he the

218
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,990
one person named turd Turkmen world is

219
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,539
called Turkmen he was he was a French

220
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,699
speaker and what he did was he wrote a

221
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:55,580
tool for encrypting communications back

222
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,009
and forth so um when we were looking at

223
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,780
the code we identified that he was a

224
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,520
French speaker and we were able to tell

225
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,650
that based off of the way he wrote this

226
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,680
code because he was using French words

227
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:09,460
in there his the project name was infos

228
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,250
encryptor which didn't really make sense

229
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,318
but the interesting thing was the path

230
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,479
that he installed it to was a c program

231
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,400
files herkiman and then infos encrypter

232
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,949
so once we pivoted off of that we were

233
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,989
to find other tools that he wrote too so

234
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:25,789
when you look at the at the tool for

235
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,490
encrypting the traffic it's very

236
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:31,099
rudimentary it's very drag-and-drop what

237
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,289
you do is you take you put your

238
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,659
encrypted text in the top and then you

239
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,620
can decrypt it and he was also he also

240
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,799
wrote

241
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,659
you can use Arabic a lot of it for a lot

242
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,279
of the buttons so I went and I decoded

243
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,860
the Arabic so you can go ahead and read

244
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,200
exactly what the buttons do but as I

245
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,360
said it's very point-and-click so I push

246
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,010
button I get thing I push button here I

247
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,360
get thing here so it's pretty much just

248
00:08:52,010 --> 00:09:00,279
it D it straight decodes and then the

249
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,720
textbook for textbox for is a 496 bit

250
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,939
RSA encryption and that was the lowest

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,320
it could do so you can go up to like a

252
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,660
hundred thousand if you wanted it takes

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,350
like several hours to decode where

254
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,270
encrypt so another tool that he wrote is

255
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,820
he wrote a program called deleter

256
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,990
and was you can preload the delete or

257
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:23,750
pop file with different binary paths and

258
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,580
different paths for different for

259
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,930
different files so if you have somebody

260
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,910
coming in braiding your house and you

261
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,260
want to leave all your evidence you can

262
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,480
use the leader to go ahead and delete

263
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:34,460
those files if they if someone was

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,670
looking at it so the way that he

265
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:39,680
implemented it was he he is used like

266
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,130
directory moved in directory delete so

267
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,829
really wasn't forensically sound for

268
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,630
deleting the files as I was testing it

269
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,610
and as you start doing stuff with

270
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,959
forensics you'll realize that even

271
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,020
though someone's trying to delete

272
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,640
something the date there is still data

273
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,980
on the disk and if there even if there's

274
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,550
data that's not specific to that is on

275
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,140
the disk

276
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,079
you also have other artifacts that are

277
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,449
there too so it's worth mentioning that

278
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,850
even though he tried to do it securely

279
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,320
it really wasn't and it was just the way

280
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,150
he implemented it well you could tell

281
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,240
that this was one of the first programs

282
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:16,970
he'd ever written I'm playing into the

283
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,089
into the French aspect of it I'm you see

284
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:23,420
where he was using less info and that

285
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:26,839
was and that was also French for the

286
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,099
info I guess and then he oh there was

287
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,390
also other French words that he was

288
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,709
using in there so we know that he was a

289
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,330
native so we knew that he was

290
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:34,790
comfortable programming in French and

291
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,200
then the other buttons were in Arabic so

292
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,599
we knew that French was his native

293
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,370
language and then it's like it would

294
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,360
work but it was buggy and it really

295
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,399
wasn't that great

296
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,040
code so also time back to dark web stuff

297
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,019
Mirai which is IOT powers and for those

298
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,719
who haven't heard of IOT haven't heard

299
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,339
of Mirai it was the DDoS malware that

300
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,290
was used to hit Brian Krebs

301
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,240
there was a DDoS malware that took out

302
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,339
Dyne which knocked out a good bit of the

303
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,680
East Coast here as well as a bunch of

304
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,649
other stuff and the interesting thing is

305
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,359
that of moriah malware is compiled for

306
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:12,010
different architectures so it's compiled

307
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,180
for while IP cameras a lot of DVRs

308
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,459
it's been using a lot of mini

309
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,279
large-scale attacks it's also

310
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:22,550
accidentally broken things such as one

311
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,670
attacker you use it to exploit the trro

312
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,370
6:9 protocol which is a it's a routing

313
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,990
protocol that TalkTalk was using so a

314
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,730
hundred thousand users of Talk Talk

315
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,529
account in the UK had gotten knocked

316
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,050
offline what they were trying to infect

317
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:38,930
with uh with Mirai so it's got a lot of

318
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,459
things that they have broken if you

319
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,529
haven't checked Krebs his most recent

320
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,719
article definitely check it out because

321
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,029
it talks about some of the some of the

322
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,399
actors behind RI or behind one of the

323
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:51,019
bots of Mirai and some of you guys may

324
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,600
have seen the leak of an SMP

325
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:57,529
who was the one who originally leaked

326
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,120
the Mirai source code so when you look

327
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,480
at the when you look at the Mirai

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,190
malware it originated from the DDoS

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,990
community and originated from the booter

330
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,670
community and the hack forum communities

331
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,170
and a lot of these kids who just want to

332
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,329
knock each other off line of when

333
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,979
they're playing a Playstation or Xbox or

334
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,519
whatever just to get the just to get the

335
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,990
edge the more we started looking at it

336
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,269
the more red herrings that were in now

337
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,829
we're in the malware and it's just you

338
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,750
had little things that didn't really

339
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:25,300
make sense and that we're in there but

340
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,980
completely fight back to something else

341
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,740
to the point where the key that the

342
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,589
attackers had used is they'd use the

343
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,440
dead beef in hacks as they as the

344
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,180
encoding key for their malware it's like

345
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,930
okay and when I was looking at like okay

346
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,430
it's gonna be a four four byte xor key

347
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,229
go ahead and iterate through it and it

348
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,540
just really wasn't coming out as I would

349
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,190
like it to and like I said as you see

350
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,089
with the rafter in the rocket you can

351
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,540
definitely tell it

352
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:55,430
Photoshop from the pixels as well as all

353
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,829
the red herrings that were in there but

354
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,800
one of the beautiful things with XOR is

355
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:04,400
you can want to inherent things of it is

356
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,880
if you have a piece a and piece B you

357
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:10,459
can get PC so if I take piece a and PC I

358
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,980
can get piece B so you can get you can

359
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,240
get the other information so here when I

360
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,500
was trying to figure out what the extra

361
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
key was that they were using

362
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,060
I had the encoded data that I had used

363
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,460
in their comments of the code they said

364
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,410
the XOR they said here's what the

365
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,170
decoded value is so I just took the

366
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,510
value a and value C did a single byte

367
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,360
and I X were those together and it gave

368
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:34,910
me my key of 22 hacks and the cool thing

369
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,500
is is they went ahead and in most of the

370
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,969
Moriah samples I've been looking at it's

371
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,820
been 20 it's been 22 hacks when the 0 6

372
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,860
9 stuff went public the attackers were

373
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,630
using had modified that to use exploit

374
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,180
code which was a different set than the

375
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,730
than the original Moriah authors and

376
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,050
then we posted a blog post about that so

377
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,080
the interesting thing was once we

378
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,790
mentioned the XOR of the 22 hacks the

379
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,250
more of the numerous other Maya authors

380
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,199
went and changed the malware based off

381
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,330
of that so a lot of interesting stuff

382
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,300
around via around Mirai and how they

383
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,790
change that so if you've never seen an

384
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,430
XOR don't know what it is it's a bitwise

385
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:17,089
function the way it works is it's just

386
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,729
an easy way to make data look different

387
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,650
you can also zero out information so if

388
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,740
you're working with assembly and you see

389
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,810
something like X or e ax e ax a number

390
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,280
XOR with itself is always zero so you

391
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,280
can use it to clear memory clear

392
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,930
registers and stuff it's also we were

393
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,220
cheap on the cpu so if you're writing

394
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,380
shellcode or if you're writing an

395
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,660
exploit a lot of attackers like to use

396
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,640
that just because it's a very it's a 1

397
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,860
straight simple instruction it from the

398
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,390
x86 instruction set that you can go

399
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,730
ahead and use and it's very as I said

400
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,100
it's very cheap and believe it or not a

401
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,690
lot of attackers use it and the cool

402
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,930
thing is is Muraya they were actually

403
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,030
using it to to send Rick rolls to send

404
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,709
payloads I've seen it in work documents

405
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,569
with executables embedded inside of them

406
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,259
so it's something that every attacker

407
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,179
use

408
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:04,189
for all of these years and I still don't

409
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:07,069
know why they keep doing it because it's

410
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:08,660
easy to break and fun to break so as I

411
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:10,219
said before there's the like an inherent

412
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,719
vulnerability and the next door I

413
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,600
wouldn't know if it's vulnerability or

414
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,299
feature but as I said if you XOR data

415
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,160
with itself it becomes zero so if you

416
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:20,899
XOR the data while it's encrypted you

417
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,749
also get that key back and the great

418
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:26,389
thing is is also if you take a key and

419
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:29,359
you XOR it 42 times or if you take a

420
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:31,220
value X or a 42 times it's still gonna

421
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:32,749
be the same data because you know that

422
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,729
with the 42 times it still gonna be the

423
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:38,089
answer so it's always gonna be something

424
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:39,399
even that you can get the same data so

425
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,929
multiple passes aren't always effective

426
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,059
um I was explaining to one coworker and

427
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,789
he was saying that there was one group

428
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,679
who did an XOR with several keys and I

429
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:50,089
grew out the math form and everything I

430
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:51,738
showed them that even though they did

431
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,439
with the several keys all you need is

432
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:56,389
that one key and it still doesn't matter

433
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:58,368
if they use 16 different keys of a

434
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,259
single byte X or you can still get the

435
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:02,209
computation of those 16 figure out what

436
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,759
that key is and you can get your

437
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:07,279
original value so multiple passes are

438
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,929
not effective against XOR but attackers

439
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,160
still use it which is a great mix or

440
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:12,039
life is easy as reverse engineers

441
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,019
because it's magic

442
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,489
so that's what the cool things that you

443
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:18,799
can do is you can actually guess the

444
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:21,049
data that's in there with you when you

445
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,059
know the data that your end result is

446
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,799
gonna be and you know what your Keys

447
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,069
gonna be you can start working the other

448
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,039
way so if I have my decode if I have my

449
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:32,509
decoded data as well as my key I can

450
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,209
start guessing what this next value is

451
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:37,910
gonna be over here and from RI this was

452
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:41,209
really cool because a lot of times the

453
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,759
single byte XOR with um with the 22

454
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,258
hacks but what if the attackers go and

455
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,359
change that what if they know that

456
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:49,459
that's something that I know and they go

457
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,109
and try and make that better so if you

458
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,809
take nothing away from this presentation

459
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:55,399
take these next few slides away because

460
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:57,350
this is something that you guys can use

461
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,229
this is actionable information that you

462
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,020
can use to protect your enterprises so

463
00:16:59,229 --> 00:17:03,600
listen

464
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,629
so the cool thing is is that with yara

465
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,120
you can do a lot of really cool things

466
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,250
with it you can also pre calculate a lot

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,869
of information based off of those known

468
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:15,270
values so if you know that an attacker

469
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:17,639
is going to use in Microsoft comm and

470
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,160
you need to have a permutation of that

471
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,230
you can start using different values to

472
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,420
figure that out to use a Python to write

473
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,750
out your yard rules for that the great

474
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,400
thing is if you know that you can look

475
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,850
at Majid bikes as well so if you're

476
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,980
trying to find a Windows War file that

477
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,469
has an X cube one side of it you can

478
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,570
write your own rule for the magic bytes

479
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,510
uproar at the beginning looking for exe

480
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,610
with no case there you go rar file with

481
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,850
an executable it stops every time you

482
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:50,219
can detect it looking for a zip PK exe

483
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,480
done I mean it's the best way to think

484
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,700
of it is like I think of it like an IDs

485
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,410
for binary data you could do a lot of

486
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,970
really cool information with it and it's

487
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,220
boolean logic really good way to write

488
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,220
rules so let's go ahead and take a look

489
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,710
at the decoded data for Mirai so you can

490
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,960
see up here in the red you have the

491
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,030
words root and admin so the interesting

492
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,150
thing is that is in every sample that

493
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,220
I've seen and the reason that that is in

494
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,440
there is because they're using that to

495
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,480
brute force the passwords of the routers

496
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,740
in order to compromise the routers so if

497
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,630
they go ahead and get in it will install

498
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,730
them right onto there and then they can

499
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,890
go ahead and it will just continue being

500
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,360
used for the DDoS the ones that are in

501
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,330
blue we're not necessarily always there

502
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,040
so the ones the first ones in blue the

503
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,800
sense of a candy cane and those were the

504
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,428
the attack domains that they're the c2

505
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,440
domains at the this author was using and

506
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,700
then listening ton zero was just again

507
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,350
one of those artifacts that was good

508
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,809
that was constantly in there as I

509
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,340
mentioned the youtube link right under

510
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,080
the first scenes of a candy cane that

511
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,629
was actually a rickroll link so if you

512
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,040
follow it it's just a straight rickroll

513
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,390
and then also one of the things that a

514
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,840
lot of attackers have used in different

515
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,340
ddos malware is the LOL no GTFO so now

516
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
that's what we're going to use in order

517
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,959
to go ahead and create our signature

518
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,580
because this data here is it's decoded

519
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,360
but it's decode with a single byte XOR

520
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,889
of 22 hacks so

521
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,669
other cool things is we can use Python

522
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:16,880
in order to take that string we could

523
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,040
then use a single byte XOR to take that

524
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,559
data and try and figure out okay what's

525
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,420
a single byte XOR of LOL MLG TFO look

526
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,280
like with the value of 1 what's that

527
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,170
look like with the value of 2 and the

528
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,820
value of 3 and the value of 4 and you

529
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,440
could create a yard rule for that and

530
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,780
the cool thing with creating that yard

531
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,940
rule is even though now you have a

532
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,309
signature that looks for encoded data

533
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,410
inside of the binary that you can use in

534
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,178
order to detect what the key is and you

535
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,890
can even take that step further let's

536
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:44,840
say I have a word document that has an X

537
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:47,390
boy and one of ones that was popular was

538
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:51,110
CBD 2012 1 5 8 which tied back to the

539
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,210
trend wheel in attacks so one of the

540
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,129
cool things that they did was also they

541
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,929
would XOR an executable append it to

542
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,660
bottom so now if you start looking for

543
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:02,179
the magic bytes of this program which is

544
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,250
the which is in the daus header you can

545
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:06,799
now do you can now start detecting a

546
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,660
single by XOR inside of malicious Word

547
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,370
document so you can now start using that

548
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,080
to find O'Day's and different taxes

549
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,870
they're coming against your enterprise

550
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,189
if they use something like an RTF you

551
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:17,899
can go ahead and expand that instead of

552
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,630
just using the hex you can now use that

553
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,270
for the RTF files so don't forget your

554
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,120
ascii love just because that can be used

555
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,110
for zeus was using that a lot where they

556
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,330
would append the executable on the

557
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,040
bottom of a boat would render as ASCII

558
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,659
so now you're able to start detecting a

559
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,700
lot of these different attack vectors

560
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,380
and yes i know this can probably be

561
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,210
written in an easier one liner but I

562
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,190
wanted to space it out for make it

563
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,419
easier to see so what you go and you

564
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,940
generate this is what your rule looks

565
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,200
like you have your your hex value and

566
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,270
then you have your ASCII value it goes

567
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,250
all the way down and as I said before if

568
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,918
you could look for this program that is

569
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:53,870
absolute money in the network you will

570
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,970
help stop the lawyer stuff you'll help

571
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,379
detect a lot of your attacks that are

572
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,540
coming in and you can start seeing a lot

573
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,919
of that so that is like a money sig that

574
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,050
you're looking for just this program

575
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,870
single by X or from 1 to 255

576
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:09,909
so in closing malware authors always are

577
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,590
trying to be one step ahead but if you

578
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,930
remember the string we were able to

579
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,610
detect that the string the string was

580
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,800
trying to buy a beer and based off of

581
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,719
the different attributes of that you

582
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,730
great we were able to pick up on that so

583
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,320
if we call them out and if we say that

584
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,390
they're trying to do something they're

585
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,700
gonna go back and change likewise when

586
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,070
the we were looking at the Mirai family

587
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,830
a malware backed with a taro 6:9 those

588
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,179
exploits were being used for other for

589
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,129
other stuff as well when we called mount

590
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,540
they completely change that so as

591
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,740
researchers a lot of the stuff that we

592
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:43,240
post out there attackers were looking at

593
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,550
I've seen this in many cases be it with

594
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,260
dire or with dried axe I can sit here to

595
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:49,330
tell you some funny adventures with the

596
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,150
dire stuff so what so one of the things

597
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:55,510
that we did with it with dire is like we

598
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,070
try to when they weren't very active we

599
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,900
tried to push them as hard in as fast as

600
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:00,370
we could so the cool thing with doing

601
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,170
that is they would change their malware

602
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,159
you oppose a blog post we were they

603
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,290
change their malware we post a blog

604
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,090
posted there were several times where we

605
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,639
would want to brand we figured this out

606
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,260
early on so we would go ahead and when

607
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,000
they would try it when they would go and

608
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,160
post something we would try and burn a

609
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,750
certain aspect but not another aspect of

610
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,550
it and the interesting piece with doing

611
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,890
that is you're now starting to

612
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,360
understand the psychology and how your

613
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,430
attacker interacts with you as a REIT as

614
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,800
a person so the cool thing was that the

615
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,690
attackers slipped up one time and

616
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,600
started yelling at some researches on on

617
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,940
Twitter so good story we actually have

618
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,320
one of the actors I got a picture of one

619
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,520
of the actors so that was a fun times so

620
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,179
you always have to think one step ahead

621
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,180
of your actors

622
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,499
