[Applause]

3
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:15,070
you know a lot of folks have been

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,200
speaking about how you have to prepare

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,380
your presentation for this conference

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,990
about nine months in advance and you

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,390
have this sort of idea that's just

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,330
stated in your mind and you present it

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:31,390
and you you propose it and over time

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,030
that really changes and I was actually

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,350
speaking with Scott and Scott was

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,550
talking about some stuff and then I was

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,649
talking about what I was going to

14
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,410
present on and I realized I'm not really

15
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:44,079
talking about management per se but I am

16
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,879
talking about some techniques that I use

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,160
to effectively create and manage and

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,910
evaluate threat intelligence technical

19
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,679
threat intelligence data and I think

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,218
there's a lot of cool concepts here that

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,260
I've never seen presented elsewhere or

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,420
conceptualized in these same ways so I

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,908
really hope a lot of folks take these

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:11,639
ideas steal them implement them in the

25
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:14,859
best ways possible for themselves in my

26
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:17,619
mindset in the private sector world

27
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,229
threat intelligence really supports

28
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:22,719
three different functions operationally

29
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:26,619
it supports and helps you out and helps

30
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:30,038
you evaluate what you should do after

31
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:33,759
you've detected threat X where threat is

32
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:36,069
maybe malware an actor or an exploit I

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,209
guess in Rob leaves mine it doesn't it

34
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:42,340
is not a vulnerability you can also

35
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:44,319
support strategy with threat

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,539
intelligence and in that case you're

37
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,060
really trying to determine what threats

38
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:52,810
and what issues you should spend your

39
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,299
limited security budget on the last bit

40
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,900
is kind of the technical or tactical

41
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,660
threat intelligence bit

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,070
and that's really based upon how do you

43
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:06,060
detect or protect against threat X and

44
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,820
for the most part this entire

45
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,480
presentation is based upon that last

46
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:15,329
bullet point there when you take a look

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,619
at IOC s a lot of folks the first thing

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,240
that they do whenever they're looking at

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,040
them is they just count them they want

50
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,980
to know how many IOC s am I getting from

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,040
this feed or from this data source and

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,649
in this slide we've got three different

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,109
areas that we're pulling data in from

54
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,030
one of them is the abuse dot CH feeds

55
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,520
and this is the aggregate of them all

56
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,800
you know fado track or SSL tracker Zeus

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,870
tracker what-have-you and you're really

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,230
only getting a couple hundred of IOC s

59
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,670
per month from that feed from OS n in

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,070
this case what we're doing is we're

61
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,260
actually just scraping all of the blog

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,549
sources that we can find and running

63
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,040
them through an algorithm trying to

64
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,170
prevent false positives and only pulling

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,290
those high fidelity indicators into our

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,739
system again that's really only a couple

67
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,530
hundred every month the next feed there

68
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,780
is Brad's malware traffic analysis blog

69
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:09,560
and the IO sees that come from there

70
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,420
largely based upon exploit kits and

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,780
opportunistic crime where again another

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,399
only a few hundred iOS es per month the

73
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,590
kind of next step that a lot of folks

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,270
take is they bounce them against their

75
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,850
logs and their Sims and what-have-you

76
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,340
and determine what is the true to false

77
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,870
positive rate of these IO sees how many

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,540
false positives am I getting how many

79
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,450
true positives am I getting this is

80
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:36,329
really missing a significant bit of the

81
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:38,488
problem and that's all of those i/o sees

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,260
here in the red are non actionable

83
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,519
you're pulling them in you don't really

84
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,440
know what to do with them you're

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,510
evaluating them your folks are marking

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,540
them as non actionable in my opinion

87
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,989
that's way worse than just about every

88
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,579
other category here I want to know if

89
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,190
it's a true or false positive all the

90
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,350
non actionable bits are things that

91
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,079
somebody may have thought was malicious

92
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,549
I'm finding them in my environment but

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,380
we don't know what to do about it

94
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,880
we can't effectively triage those in

95
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:13,329
those cases we spent a few weeks back in

96
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,359
July trying to make those two points

97
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,530
converge where there were no

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,730
non-actionable events that we were

99
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,409
actually seeing out in the wild the the

100
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,400
team was really kind of stressed out

101
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,720
after I pushed them this way but we got

102
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,239
it for a little bit and then it quickly

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,660
spread apart you really need a large

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,460
amount of threat analysts in order to

105
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,410
dig into all the IOC s that you're

106
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,270
seeing and that are coming into your

107
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:46,120
environment and to make sure that they

108
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,859
all have context so one of the best ways

109
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,700
to make sure that all of your IOC s have

110
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:55,180
context is to create them yourself and

111
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,840
in this case there are two categories of

112
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:03,670
feeds here one of them is based upon

113
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:06,219
malware data and in one of those cases

114
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,470
the backdoor feed it runs malware

115
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,840
through a sandbox as well as config

116
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,630
dumps the malware and when I say config

117
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,909
dumps I mean you take them out where you

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,450
walk the binary structure of it you find

119
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,580
the C two's persistence mechanisms

120
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,250
mutexes and so forth from that piece of

121
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,349
malware and then you ingest those but

122
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,210
now you know the exact sample and the

123
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,280
exact malware family that that came from

124
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:35,140
so you have all of that context to go

125
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,969
along with this the malware IOC s feed

126
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,919
is taking over for the other feeds and

127
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:43,350
then the rat hunter is just based upon

128
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,970
the keV the Hermit style config dumpers

129
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,070
when you look at those feeds there's

130
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,200
thousands of IOC s coming in every month

131
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:54,719
it looks like those are maybe more

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:58,659
valuable but the other feeds here on the

133
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,410
right are based upon indicator expansion

134
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,350
and when I say that I mean taking

135
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:08,169
criteria and in our cases we found that

136
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:10,300
just taking the pivot on DNS data

137
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,810
to a known IP address was really

138
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,879
false-positive prone but if you take the

139
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,370
registrant information such as an email

140
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,870
address and then additional information

141
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,389
such as the name servers that are being

142
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,029
pointed to for those newly registered

143
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,919
domains and use that as the criteria to

144
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:33,360
pull it in you can really create some

145
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:37,359
really high value indicator feeds when

146
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,150
we were looking at that data it took a

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,520
lot of human effort to stay up on those

148
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,400
malicious actors and largely crime where

149
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,318
actors and bulletproof hosters and we

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,188
were only getting about 200 indicators a

151
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,919
month or so

152
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:53,229
versus those thousands of indicators and

153
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,219
that's one way to evaluate it but it's

154
00:06:53,229 --> 00:07:02,770
really not telling the whole story here

155
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:08,710
in my view and in my perspective the

156
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:09,998
best metric for determining the value of

157
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,250
the threat intelligence that you're

158
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:14,229
bringing in and the value of your

159
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,050
detection is whether or not you're

160
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:20,110
reducing dwell time and these statistics

161
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,139
are from Mandy at SEM trends report

162
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:28,060
where the external notification median

163
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:30,550
time is mean time is 320 days the

164
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,279
internal median or the overall median

165
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,669
time is 146 days and if you're

166
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:39,069
discovering the intrusions yourself with

167
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,859
your own detection criteria it tends to

168
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:43,870
be about 56 days between when the actor

169
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,789
has got an established persistence

170
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,830
inside your environment - when you've

171
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:52,139
detected them so if we take the IOC s

172
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,210
that we're bringing in that we're

173
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,330
creating ourselves and we want to

174
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,370
measure how well that is going to help

175
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,400
us reduce that 12 time we've got to

176
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:09,010
understand what the age of the IOC is

177
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,710
in this case in my the the actors set up

178
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,440
a command and control server established

179
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,229
that on an IP address then they register

180
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,660
domains which are going to point to that

181
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,729
IP address on that c2 server and then

182
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,889
they start using that for their

183
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:28,750
operations eventually the actors are

184
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,580
going to be discovered and you're going

185
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,320
to find those indicators and then you're

186
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,539
going to apply those to your detection

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,370
and protection technologies and at that

188
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,750
point you've established coverage for

189
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,000
that IOC so what I did was I took the

190
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,740
time between domain names when they were

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,230
registered to the time that they were

192
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,110
ingested into our threat intelligence

193
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:54,070
platform and when we discovered those

194
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,700
indicators and that's the IOC age in my

195
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,560
view you can also do this with malware

196
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,310
samples where you take the PE build date

197
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:07,420
and use that as the established start of

198
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,459
the malware hash per se and then to the

199
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,500
point when you've discovered it as the

200
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:16,390
ingestion date so using that I created

201
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,860
these bullet charts to take a look at

202
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:25,630
how useful are these different feeds the

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:29,709
way to read this chart is the bars along

204
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:35,470
the chart are this feeds median time for

205
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:38,680
the IOC age the dark gray towards the

206
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,720
end is the is that external median time

207
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,260
to discovery

208
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,870
the light gray all the way over to the

209
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:51,069
left is the internal median discovery

210
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:54,430
time of 56 days and that blue bar is the

211
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,250
overall median time if I was working at

212
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,170
an internal organization like the small

213
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,880
family-owned industrial company here

214
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:06,479
that presented previously I would put

215
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480
our

216
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,790
median time to discovery as the blue bar

217
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,680
there in that way you could measure it

218
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:19,410
against how well you're doing and to see

219
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:23,410
if you are improving your dwell time and

220
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:25,630
lowering that so taking a look at these

221
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,670
different feeds with the OS n scraping

222
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,160
that we are doing of all of those blogs

223
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:34,240
that you know the Talos intelligence

224
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,660
Kaspersky's blog flashpoints blog and so

225
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
forth

226
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,500
scraping those sources the average the

227
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,810
median IOC age there is actually about a

228
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,430
hundred sixty days so that's really not

229
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,739
getting us to improve our dwell time and

230
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,229
getting ahead of the adversaries there

231
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,240
if we just look at the backdoor speed

232
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,010
that's the cab the hermit's config

233
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,550
dumping you're all the way out at about

234
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,290
three hundred and forty days if we look

235
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,140
at the malware indicators feed which

236
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,829
includes a lot of crime we're like h1n1

237
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,990
janitor Andromeda and so forth that

238
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,680
brings us down to 75 days now we're

239
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,510
getting somewhere

240
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,270
and and we're starting to lower that

241
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,730
dwell time but then the other thing that

242
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,939
actors registrant information the

243
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,940
indicator expansion based feeds what we

244
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:27,250
found was there actually we're actually

245
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,400
able to get up on new indicators in two

246
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,950
days and as far as I've been able to

247
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,189
tell that's the quickest methodology

248
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:40,750
that you can use to capture new i/o sees

249
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:46,180
and to really get as close to boom in

250
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:49,209
the intrusion life cycle the SSL

251
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,699
pivoting concept that Mark presented

252
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,349
yesterday I think it would also end up

253
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,000
about two days because if you look at

254
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,260
that data you've got a wait for census

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,880
not IO to create the data and present

256
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,290
that data and then you've got to ingest

257
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,130
that yourself which is going to take an

258
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,130
additional day

259
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,779
the one problem with the back doors as

260
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,790
well as the malware indicator feeds and

261
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:18,930
why the lifetime of those IOC s is so

262
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,949
far out in comparison for the others is

263
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,500
fundamentally based upon the fact that

264
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,290
the actors have to create the malware

265
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,839
the malware has to be delivered and then

266
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,180
it has to be discovered by the defense

267
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,800
of organizations then share it out to

268
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,079
some place where you can grab the

269
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,120
malware and then you have to ingest it

270
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,189
and pull that in yourself so you have

271
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,459
all of those actions happening before

272
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:47,130
you're able to ingest the indicators but

273
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:49,750
I the I think this is a really useful

274
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,490
methodology for evaluating a lot of the

275
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,540
indicator feeds that you're probably

276
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:57,610
taking in yourselves at home and pulling

277
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,680
this information and creating this

278
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:05,050
information can be done with any one of

279
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,479
those domain name API resources like

280
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,890
domain tools passive total or a threat

281
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,320
intelligence platform as well so I guess

282
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,199
there's this triangle of threat that

283
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:23,769
somebody created in a hotel room at

284
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:26,829
while they were drinking and and at the

285
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:29,740
bottom of that are all of the IOC s but

286
00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:31,209
then in the upper half of that really in

287
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,730
order to detect those sorts of things

288
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:35,739
it's based upon signatures and analytics

289
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:39,490
and heuristics and models and so forth

290
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,800
and I thought of this after I've already

291
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,410
submitted these papers or submitted

292
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,329
these slides and I really should change

293
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,709
the next couple of sides to detection

294
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:50,229
Xand not signatures I think a lot of

295
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,089
people get hung up on signatures but

296
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:56,680
it's been really interesting seeing

297
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:57,910
organizations from the side that I've

298
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,750
been seeing them over the past two years

299
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,399
a lot of orgs are very adverse to

300
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,690
signatures it's been it's been kind of

301
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,180
interesting to see that and a lot of

302
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,139
people only rely upon IOC s for their

303
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,138
detection criteria

304
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:16,260
previously as I had worked on more

305
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,090
signature-based systems we had this

306
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,640
concept of tactical signatures and

307
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,550
tactical signatures are based around a

308
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,580
specific piece of malware or a specific

309
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,979
threat and the great thing about those

310
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,920
tactical signatures is if you really

311
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,260
want to get ahead of those IOC s being

312
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,810
created you really need signatures so

313
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,600
that you can cover all of the IOC s that

314
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,310
that malware family is using and if you

315
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,830
take a look at this North signature here

316
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,479
there's something that you might notice

317
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:50,010
which is there is not a URI in there and

318
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,200
it's kind of interesting to me I see a

319
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:55,470
lot of signatures created by folks which

320
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:58,020
have you are eyes in them and when I was

321
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,850
taught to build signatures I was always

322
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,130
taught to look at the headers if you're

323
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,210
looking at HTTP traffic and to try to

324
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:09,360
work on those rather than on the IOC

325
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,940
based bits of you our eyes and domains

326
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,480
and so forth and in this case this oil

327
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,760
rig backdoor the interesting thing that

328
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,700
I saw there was the content type is

329
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,030
binary care set utf-8 and that's kind of

330
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:27,900
odd it should really be content type

331
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,000
text utf-8 binary utf-8 is weird

332
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,100
I took a look through a lot of web

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,680
proxies and I didn't see anything that

334
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,330
actually uses that content type so I'm

335
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,260
pretty sure that's unique to this

336
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,260
malware and one of those odd situations

337
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:52,100
strategic signatures are a little

338
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:54,800
different and in these cases what you're

339
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,960
looking for are the entire tactic or

340
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,849
technique that an actor is using or

341
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,400
malicious people are using and you're

342
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,990
trying to create a signature which will

343
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,870
catch that entire technique and then

344
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:09,410
therefore catch multiple families of

345
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:13,040
malware as well what Ronnie was talking

346
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:16,280
about yesterday with the X or encoded P

347
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,829
headers of this program cannot be run in

348
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,110
DOS mode and so forth that will be a

349
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,710
strategic signature because their X or

350
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,850
encoding lots of people X or encode

351
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,790
binaries and try to pass them over the

352
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:33,470
wire to get past just looking for that

353
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:35,599
MZ header and creating the signatures

354
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,320
for all of the X or all of the possible

355
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:43,360
xor keys will allow you to detect all of

356
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,360
that so that makes sense

357
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,370
and then there are strategic protections

358
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,690
such as two-factor authentication if

359
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,750
you're dealing with a lot of credential

360
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,300
exposures and then it's always nice to

361
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,660
put some real numbers on things every so

362
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,839
often a lot of folks talk about blocking

363
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:08,319
dynamic DNS but and it seems like a

364
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:12,189
pretty obvious thing to do but from the

365
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,339
data that we've been pulling in from OSN

366
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:19,150
scraping 82% of the domains that we pull

367
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,599
in our dynamic DNS from the config

368
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:25,179
dumping of all of the malware 96% of the

369
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:29,168
domains that we find in that config dump

370
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,690
malware or dynamic DNS domains that's

371
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:33,780
kind of interesting to me so hopefully

372
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,090
you can take those and use those as a

373
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,559
statistic to further bolster the case of

374
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,470
blocking dynamic DNS and your

375
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:47,080
organization's the last topic that I

376
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,169
wanted to hit here is this concept of

377
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:54,310
coverage and Alex I think has a couple

378
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:58,000
of questions regarding this with

379
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,169
we start tracking threats there's a lot

380
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,150
of people that talk about tracking

381
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,070
threats and you might establish some

382
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,930
sort of automated system to track

383
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,120
threats or you might be tracking a

384
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,770
threat internally using you know the

385
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,389
kill chain and the campaigns that you

386
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,270
have coming into your organization and

387
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:17,950
so forth and this concept works both

388
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:23,889
from intrusion data within your

389
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,420
organization as well as from IOC s that

390
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,840
you're gathering around an and a

391
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,430
specific threat as well as from numbers

392
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,709
of samples that you're gathering for a

393
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:36,040
specific piece of malware or the tool

394
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:39,280
kits for a specific actor group in

395
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:43,090
essence what you do is the bottom left

396
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,930
here is the pure volume over each time

397
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,780
period for each one of these threats

398
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:54,180
quote-unquote the radar chart in the

399
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,860
upper right is really the piece that's

400
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,530
helping you track and understand how

401
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,120
much of that threat you're actually

402
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:06,520
looking at along the edges here are the

403
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,139
maximum amount of data that you've ever

404
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:13,320
seen for threat whatever over that time

405
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:17,530
period say it's a month say it's a week

406
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,439
the purple lines in the chart are the

407
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,820
mean amounts the average amount of data

408
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,550
that you see for each one of these

409
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,649
threats and then the blue lines are

410
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:29,250
based upon the amount of data that

411
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:34,570
you've collected over this time period

412
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:37,570
for that threat so in this slide we see

413
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:41,169
the extreme web a bulletproof host er

414
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,790
the blue line almost meets the purple

415
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,850
line there so we've got pretty good

416
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,080
coverage on them we know that we have

417
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,560
the same amount of data that we

418
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,480
typically bring in for that threat that

419
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,240
we're looking at

420
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,650
pin SPB another bulletproof hoster we're

421
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,600
bringing in the same amount of data that

422
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,210
we always see for them we're pretty

423
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,639
solid they're the dry Dex activity same

424
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,910
things say pretty average pretty

425
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,790
standard the manipulators though the

426
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,510
blue line is significantly inside that

427
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:15,510
purple line in this case we're probably

428
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,910
missing something and whenever you see

429
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,490
this there is a question during the last

430
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,040
talk about how do you prioritize what

431
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,700
you're looking at in this case I would

432
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:29,520
prioritize my analysts to take a look at

433
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,470
the manipulators again to see what we're

434
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,270
missing why aren't we seeing them why

435
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,360
did we collect less information about

436
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:39,060
them over this time period but then the

437
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,949
server activity in this new chart is all

438
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,840
the way out to the edge of the graph so

439
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,850
we've collected more information

440
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,810
regarding server during this time period

441
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,540
then any time period before and it's way

442
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:54,720
farther than the average or mean amount

443
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,879
of activity that we've collected and the

444
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,370
top of the graph that's cut off a little

445
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,950
there is based upon the Pony information

446
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,959
and again we're missing significant

447
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,880
amounts of data so what happened do they

448
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,300
no longer use Pony did they move on to a

449
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:13,620
new toolset or is it a holiday somewhere

450
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,510
what happened so the last two slides

451
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,129
really are just summaries of the

452
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,830
information that I've presented thus far

453
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:23,160
if your goal really is to reduced well

454
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:26,760
time measuring the IOC age is a good way

455
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:31,070
to find data and measuring the IOC age

456
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:35,580
and orienting towards the IOC s that are

457
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:38,550
most new and have the lowest age is a

458
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,620
good way to reduced well time but it's

459
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,500
better to use tactical signatures and

460
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,300
the best way to truly reduce 12-time is

461
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,180
to focus on those strategic signature

462
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,919
signatures and get those out one of a

463
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:53,370
and I forgot to mention this on that

464
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:56,040
slide but a really good source for in in

465
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,679
my opinion the best source for data to

466
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,530
be used for strategic signatures is to

467
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,240
watch penetration testers

468
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,399
and watch what they're blogging about

469
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,040
watch what they're presenting about and

470
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,080
take it their tactics because usually

471
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,629
the penetration testers will come up

472
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,580
with some new technique like on harm

473
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,520
Joy's blog the Kerberos thing over the

474
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,439
past couple of weeks figure out how to

475
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,850
detect that activity and have your

476
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,460
threat analysts and your detection

477
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,760
analysts focus on creating detections

478
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,130
for that kind of activity and in a few

479
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,080
weeks you might see a few weeks a few

480
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:33,020
months you might see the real actors

481
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,520
using those techniques against you but

482
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,410
now you already have protections and

483
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,639
detection x' in place before they've

484
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,320
even adopted those new techniques if you

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,810
want to ensure coverage for a specific

486
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,909
threat establish a baseline of the

487
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,250
threat activity and then measure the

488
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,620
captured the percent captured during

489
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:54,080
this time period against your baseline

490
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,139
and mean amount captured of that

491
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,520
activity if you want to focus on useful

492
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:04,340
detections measure the enrichment and

493
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,290
reduction of non-actionable alerts more

494
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:10,550
so than just a pure false positive and

495
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:13,550
true positive alerts and the last little

496
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,740
bit down here is the collected I OCS and

497
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,950
a lot of times there's a real hyper

498
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,720
focus in our industry on IO sees and

499
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,080
feeds and maybe the things that are in

500
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,180
the news and in all reality the

501
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,230
collected IO sees that a lot of folks

502
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:31,730
have inside feeds and so forth are not

503
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,030
equivalent to the activity that's on the

504
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,800
ground from true intrusion data and

505
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,780
building upon that true intrusion data

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,020
is the best source of information and

507
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,889
initial information that you can have

508
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:48,310
but the OS sent data is useful to

509
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:51,050
initially alert and prioritize around

510
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:54,620
and this is just the graph of detection

511
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,300
utility again so that's a the extent of

512
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,360
my presentation

513
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,360
you

514
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,499
