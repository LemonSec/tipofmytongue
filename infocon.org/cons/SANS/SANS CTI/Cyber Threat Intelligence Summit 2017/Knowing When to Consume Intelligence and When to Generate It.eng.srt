00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,820
[Applause]

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,440
perfect good morning good morning so

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,320
thank you for showing up at 9:00 a.m.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,780
for a talk that's always nice today I

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,400
want to talk about consuming versus

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,869
generating intelligence so you're gonna

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,709
see a lot today about finalizing reports

9
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,769
understanding sort of pivoting off

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,539
indicators a lot of good talks lined up

11
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,879
for today but I think this is a

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,969
fundamental question that most people

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,219
will come to in their organizations do i

14
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:41,559
leverage what's available in the

15
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:44,379
community leverage vendors leverage

16
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,440
feeds reports whatever else and just

17
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:48,940
consume intelligence or do I go a little

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,339
bit past that and actually start

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,739
generating my own intelligence so I'll

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,379
walk through today is from my

21
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:58,059
perspectives on an approach to consume

22
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:00,399
and sort of guiding our maturity along

23
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,649
how we consume and give some

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,190
recommendations on the generation of it

25
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,790
as well

26
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:09,490
so as a little bit of background now I

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,950
run a company called Drago's but yes I

28
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,420
do have the 578 course the cyber threat

29
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,110
intelligence course here at Sam's and

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,520
the ICS five one five course which is

31
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,229
Incident Response inside of industrial

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,548
control system environments probably

33
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:24,908
more importantly though I write a

34
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:26,380
comic-strip I found out my time in the

35
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,780
military that it was really really

36
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,630
beneficial to be able to explain very

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,329
technical topics to generals and

38
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,579
congressmen in three pane comics it was

39
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,798
very useful to sort of explain what

40
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:40,929
myself and my team did but a little bit

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,770
of a further background which I'll bring

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,540
into the talk is when I first got

43
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,250
started even though I was an air force

44
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,439
officer I never really worked in the Air

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,969
Force I got shipped off to one of the

46
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,880
intelligence agencies pretty much day

47
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:57,759
one and spent my whole background in

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,189
that world when I first got to this

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,530
intelligence agency they told me all

50
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,479
right your job is to generate

51
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,090
intelligence I'm like okay cool all

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,620
right gonna do this your job is to find

53
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,270
the unknown unknowns I don't think

54
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,510
that's an intelligence requirement like

55
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,069
that doesn't sound very specific and

56
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,268
testable and something that we

57
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,099
and actually work with and they're like

58
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,659
no no no it's cool like Rumsfeld's

59
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,209
talking about this unknown unknown thing

60
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:28,840
I need you to do unknown unknown cyber

61
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,639
stuff along that's the industry but I

62
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,459
have a background working with control

63
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,709
systems so I thought well I'll focus my

64
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:40,150
mission on control systems so over time

65
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:42,040
what we ended up doing was looking at

66
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,629
what nation-states were breaking in to

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,108
control system environments the whole

68
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:48,969
idea there is maybe there's threats and

69
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:50,109
teams that we just haven't seen before

70
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,549
the traditional way

71
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:53,349
so you think of normal government

72
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,579
networks normal sort of government view

73
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,569
they might see China and Russia a lot

74
00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:00,250
but that's because they're breaking into

75
00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:01,540
the defense industrial base that's

76
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,340
because of breaking into networks to

77
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,179
steal off data but maybe we don't see

78
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,889
the Algerian apt team very often but can

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,319
control system environments you might

80
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:12,669
actually see that it's different threats

81
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,369
for a different threat landscape so we

82
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,139
started identifying a number of teams

83
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,419
that nobody else was tracking just based

84
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:21,549
off of changing where we were doing our

85
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,169
collection based off of requirements so

86
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:24,489
for all of those that have seen the

87
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,409
intelligence lifecycle before right

88
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:27,970
planning in Direction led to different

89
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,709
collection which allowed us to

90
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,419
understand and analyze out hold

91
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,250
different threats that other people

92
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,159
weren't tracking so I'll try to bring

93
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,169
some of that background today as well

94
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,608
again I like comics so I'm gonna have a

95
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,919
couple of these in the slides of today

96
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,870
this is basically how everybody gets

97
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,840
invited to speak at security conferences

98
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,329
where little Bobby says we need more

99
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,099
scalable cloud-based threat intelligence

100
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,259
analytics and automate a big data

101
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,108
security endpoints and matt said do you

102
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:58,478
have no idea what you just said do you

103
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,040
nope but I said it out loud and got to

104
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,659
speak at a conference and I figure if I

105
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,159
set it twice more I'd be a security

106
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,519
expert and Matt says yeah sounds about

107
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,519
right

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,040
I generally see in this field probably

109
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,409
more than any other we are a little bit

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,668
buzzword centric if somebody can

111
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,858
actually explain to me the difference

112
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,900
between a storage platform and a threat

113
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,880
intelligence platform and a tip versus

114
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,719
some other pivoting app it would be

115
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,699
great

116
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:23,020
but it's at some points we just have a

117
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,599
lot of terms that we're throwing around

118
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,789
and maybe not fully understand so I'll

119
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:29,800
try to cover that today as well number

120
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,570
one though I'm going to look at a model

121
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,520
the sliding scale of cyber security we

122
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,680
I'll introduce here in a second to

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,130
structure this discussion of consuming

124
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,720
intelligence and before I pivot into

125
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,150
generating it so one more little Bobby

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,610
just to get us going here I have the CAS

127
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,609
oh and he tells little Bobby I need you

128
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,380
to ensure that no cyber attacks occur

129
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,510
little Bobby says great what's our

130
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,580
budget I guess oh no no no we got to cut

131
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,620
all that out what Bobby says okay well I

132
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,390
can assure you we will never see any

133
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,920
cyber attacks and again just notes

134
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,240
versus what you're seeing versus what's

135
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:07,750
actually available in the data what I

136
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,610
mean by that is a key point on whether

137
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,500
you can generate or consume intelligence

138
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,810
is based off of what's available for you

139
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,450
to consume in the first place if your

140
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,780
vendor or your feed or the public

141
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,590
information or whatever else is not

142
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,390
correlating with the intelligence

143
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,630
requirements that are levied by your

144
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,659
executives on down you will not be able

145
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,719
to just rely on consumption I would note

146
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,370
that probably some some statistically

147
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,370
relevant large portion of the community

148
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,440
really just wants to consume when we say

149
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,900
like I want a threat Intel team most

150
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,880
people just want to consume intelligence

151
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,460
what that generally looks like is hey

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,850
can I get a smart lady or guy on the

153
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,250
team that knows what we do that knows

154
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,050
what our organization does and can go

155
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,450
out into what's already produced and

156
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,400
find it match it up and drive security

157
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,930
better in our organization and that's

158
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,969
actually what a lot of threat Intel

159
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,990
teams today do they're not actually

160
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,340
generating a lot of their own

161
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,960
intelligence they're looking for what

162
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,489
intelligence is available and mapping it

163
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,830
back to the organization and that's

164
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,870
completely appropriate and that is where

165
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,550
everybody should be i'll make the pitch

166
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,980
that everybody should consume

167
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,290
intelligence but generating intelligence

168
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,760
is definitely a much loftier goal and

169
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,590
much much more expensive alright so the

170
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,820
topic of the sliding scale and for those

171
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,419
of you that my class you'll have seen

172
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,370
this slide before I got some interesting

173
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,040
positions after I got the government go

174
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,110
over and deal with a think tank and

175
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,460
seeing policy makers and talk to them

176
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,650
about cyber security at the same time

177
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,049
teaching it sands and doing for the

178
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,580
technical thing and I identified that

179
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,729
cyber security is a word that means

180
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,710
nothing

181
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,849
to everybody right I got to ask people

182
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,680
like what do you do them like I do

183
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,688
cybersecurity I'm like that doesn't help

184
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,360
me at all understand what you do as an

185
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,589
individual all right and it was

186
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,199
exacerbated at the policy level where

187
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:59,210
congressman congressional staffers they

188
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,699
had no understanding of what the

189
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,498
community was actually doing so I

190
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,300
authored a paper it's a sans white paper

191
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,529
Freema it's interesting googling it but

192
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,419
titled the sliding scale of

193
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:11,029
cybersecurity and what I basically

194
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,889
positioned is there are five categories

195
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,808
of investment you can make along

196
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:17,779
security to give you some sort of value

197
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:19,430
to your organization on the left-hand

198
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:21,499
side of the scale we have architecture

199
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,569
this is architecting your networks out

200
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:26,240
the first time securing the supply chain

201
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,210
patching the vulnerabilities that you

202
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,860
have figuring out what decisions you're

203
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,649
gonna make about how you position your

204
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,240
organization's networks and systems then

205
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:38,360
we have passive defenses and this is

206
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,589
where most of the vendor products rely

207
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,020
and this is most of where the vendor

208
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:45,199
products are in terms of some box or

209
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,469
system or aspect I can add on top of the

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,419
architecture that will do some level of

211
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:52,430
defense in the face of an adversary or

212
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:55,068
give me some level of visibility into my

213
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,800
organization but it doesn't necessarily

214
00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,110
require human activity the entire time

215
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,180
in other words I can put this box on the

216
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,979
network go home to sleep at night and

217
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,469
it's still gonna do something I may need

218
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:08,628
to update it tune it work with it but

219
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:10,909
it's not a hundred percent interaction

220
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:12,709
and that's a good thing because we just

221
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,058
don't have time the day to take care of

222
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:16,149
a hundred percent of every box on the

223
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:18,409
network so we want passive defenses an

224
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:21,020
active defense is the humans getting

225
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,748
involved it's very much that active

226
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,508
approach where a instant responder

227
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:29,120
threat hunter security operations person

228
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,550
goes through the environment looking for

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,860
threats trying to defend against the

230
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,019
threats that are currently there

231
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,699
intelligence I think we all kind of get

232
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,729
a little bit about that I'm collecting

233
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:42,409
data exploiting information creating

234
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,529
intelligence products whether it's TTP

235
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,579
briefings intelligence reports

236
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,970
tradecraft for our responders to go

237
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:51,649
better and then offense offense for a

238
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,110
security perspective has to be legal and

239
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,720
it has to be inside some sort of

240
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,220
confines of security not national

241
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,680
security so it's not this discussion of

242
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,790
should Russia in the u.s. be preparing

243
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,769
for offense for national security

244
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,660
reasons no for a cyber security

245
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,449
discussion to ask me something like

246
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,610
botnet takedowns stopping a

247
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,979
denial-of-service something to that

248
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,560
level I will note that when I made this

249
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,089
model one of the things I positioned was

250
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,099
that most of the value is on the

251
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,600
left-hand side of the scale I actually

252
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,640
don't think people should be doing

253
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,519
offense I usually tell my class very

254
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,640
bluntly like the one blunt thing I say

255
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,380
is if you suck at defense you're

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,610
probably gonna suck at offense all right

257
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,620
so don't just be like oh we can hack

258
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:36,589
back and it'll be okay like that's not

259
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,329
gonna be a good strategy so I like

260
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,189
people with a structure on the left and

261
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,989
move forward it doesn't mean only invest

262
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:43,939
in one and then move and move and move

263
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,380
but realize that the return on

264
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:48,290
investment for what you're doing in an

265
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,790
organization is much more to the

266
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,550
left-hand side of the scale moving to

267
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,310
the right as an example when I first got

268
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:58,760
to the intelligence agency that was at

269
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,229
they gave us the DoD Network and I don't

270
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,540
mean like a portion of it they gave us a

271
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,939
video D Network to look at and said hey

272
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,360
we have somewhere on the order of 10

273
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:10,219
million IP connected devices like here's

274
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,319
10 million IP connected devices I'm like

275
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,329
okay can we have like a architecture map

276
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:17,599
or like data flow diagram or anything

277
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:21,410
and like oh no this doesn't really have

278
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,329
all of that we'll figure that out but

279
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,010
can you start finding China I'm like

280
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:26,359
dude until you tell me what systems I'm

281
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,399
looking at what normal looks like

282
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,199
everything might as well be China right

283
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,670
like there's no way to structure a

284
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:33,800
really good act of Defense kind of

285
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,819
security operations and our focus on an

286
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,829
environment that you have no

287
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:38,209
understanding of but imagine from that

288
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:40,939
return on investment perspective how

289
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,589
simplistic it can be if you know your

290
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,849
systems they're well maintained do you

291
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:45,740
have the passive defenses to give you

292
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,910
visibility logs everything else by the

293
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,860
time you get to that active defense

294
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,110
stage the return on investment you're

295
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,610
getting at something like a sock is much

296
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,649
more significant so that's that's the

297
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,240
position all right so I was told we have

298
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:01,100
to use World War 2 era pictures I am

299
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,230
going to avoid what was done in like six

300
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,040
other talks and you won't see Hitler and

301
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:09,110
swastikas so I think that's like a bonus

302
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,610
but maybe next year we'll do something

303
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,899
like my little pony or something because

304
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:15,980
apparently world war ii was just too

305
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:18,620
much for people but to me if you're

306
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,560
finding yourself in the starting

307
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:24,170
position which i think most people at

308
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,779
some point will i don't want to give

309
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,699
sort of the lofty well you do what works

310
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:29,990
for you right i always hated that as a

311
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,089
new person i'd like give me some advice

312
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,430
on how to start everyone's like it it

313
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:36,890
depends it's up to you and ever really

314
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,449
helped me so here's my position if

315
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,250
you're in a position that you're already

316
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,940
often off to the races and running and

317
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,740
being awesome

318
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,329
good don't change anything based off

319
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,519
what I'm about to tell you if you're in

320
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,620
a starting position here's how I think

321
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,180
you should structure it it's the and you

322
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,910
can barely see it but it's the 40 30 20

323
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,620
10 rule up that pyramid so if we think

324
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,149
of the sliding scale of security and

325
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,950
we're gonna rule out offense cuz I don't

326
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,720
think you should do it anyways the

327
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,760
architecture which is the bottom should

328
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,430
get it probably around 40% of your time

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,740
or investments up to passive defenses

330
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,839
which are 30 percent 20 percent for

331
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,459
active defense Intel 10 percent the

332
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,010
reason I structure it like that is

333
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:15,439
because we as analysts tend to get

334
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,970
biased about what we love and not

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,220
necessarily the value we returning to

336
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,709
the organization what I mean by that is

337
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,690
Intel is by far in my opinion the

338
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:26,239
sexiest thing you can do it's cool it's

339
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,500
fun it's exciting it is in no way where

340
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,870
the security budget should be going

341
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,449
compared to all of the other things it

342
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,670
should be the 10% secret sauce you

343
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,729
sprinkle on top of a well-structured

344
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,349
well defensible environment and that

345
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,209
you're returning value to the security

346
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,470
already in place but if you don't have

347
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,939
an incident response team if you don't

348
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,070
have logs of the environment if you have

349
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,829
a patch management program it's not time

350
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,980
to invest in a very expensive Intel team

351
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,180
so that's my 40 30 20 10 rule when it

352
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,230
comes to that sliding scale

353
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,459
alright so counterintelligence along

354
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,839
this as well so I'm basically what I'm

355
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,279
doing over these next couple slides is

356
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,060
along the sliding security

357
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,699
how can you invest in Intel and this is

358
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,680
just a couple tidbits so from that first

359
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,959
category that we started the top at 10%

360
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,790
intelligence where does intelligence

361
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,229
sort of benefit its own self right

362
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,240
where's that self licking ice cream cone

363
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,939
where's the tin Intel for Intel

364
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,709
when we talk about driving intelligence

365
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:24,329
from that security standpoint back in

366
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,540
the organization to me it's a lot of

367
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:29,339
sort of the red team focus Intel for

368
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,800
strategic purposes operational we want

369
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,720
to do all that but if we're actually

370
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,508
impacting directly security from an

371
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,939
intelligence category I do like red

372
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:40,649
team's that are using the adversary

373
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,449
tactics now I didn't say anything about

374
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:43,860
pentest we're not talking about somebody

375
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,240
running necess and exploiting a

376
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,339
vulnerability and thinking that's super

377
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,949
sweet it might be for anybody that's

378
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,749
like unique snowflakes about NASA but

379
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:53,849
I'll note when it comes to red teams I'm

380
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:55,980
talking about a team that understands

381
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:59,100
from the intelligence team you know what

382
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,079
we're getting hit with this ap t28 that

383
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,879
we keep hearing about the news what are

384
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,959
the tactics techniques procedures that

385
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,449
they're using

386
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:08,279
let's emulate that against ourselves and

387
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:10,319
figure out how we're going to prioritize

388
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,509
the security investments based off of

389
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:15,059
what they would do since they're in our

390
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,589
threat model right so that Intel for

391
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,079
Intel say it could be there why the

392
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,309
pictures so I included the Red Army for

393
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:23,189
like Red Team I thought that was kind of

394
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:24,449
clever and I noted that like Russian it

395
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:26,849
and get a whole lot of love and like the

396
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:30,449
other slides they were there too in ww2

397
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:32,429
by the way I also note like last year I

398
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,589
mentioned Russia in terms of like being

399
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:36,269
a threat on some ICS stuff I'd seen and

400
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,459
actually got feedback I'm like why are

401
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:40,649
you picking on Russia Russia's not

402
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,790
always the threat I'm hoping this year

403
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:48,689
like we all are like cool with it

404
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,219
anyways so on the right hand side you'll

405
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:53,219
see in individuals anybody know who this

406
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,660
is by the way it's like the most badass

407
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,660
person in history yeah

408
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,800
it's what finnish sniper yeah all right

409
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,899
so this will just refer to him as white

410
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,969
death because that was his nickname and

411
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:10,270
I don't speak Finnish so well but white

412
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,250
death was a single Finnish farmer that

413
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:14,079
they gave a rifle to noscope or anything

414
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,880
like that and they said here's where

415
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,290
your adversary is gonna be here's what

416
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,060
your adversary looks like and was the

417
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,890
Russians at the time and he said just go

418
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,660
out and wipe out the adversaries as they

419
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,430
come into your environment he has the

420
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,480
most confirmed kills of any sniper in

421
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:31,120
history around 542 confirmed kills

422
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,399
that's pretty ridiculous for a sniper I

423
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,380
just thought that was too cool to pass

424
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,560
up there's some probably red team

425
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,899
connection there somewhere all right

426
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,410
what about active defense all right so

427
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,540
if we take an active defense discussion

428
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,550
and about how intelligence drives active

429
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,000
defense so from like a security

430
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:53,949
operation centers perspective if we have

431
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,800
an active defense team whether it's a

432
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:59,529
sockeye are people getting involved this

433
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,290
is generally the most natural place we

434
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,089
understand you use Intel it seems sort

435
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,980
of natural on I'm gonna better

436
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,250
understand adversary tradecraft so my

437
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,830
responders are gonna respond faster or I

438
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,570
understand that the lowest level form of

439
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,459
Intel these indicators are compromised

440
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,589
that when I see these indicators are

441
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,750
compromised in my network I'm probably

442
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,940
infected I need a scope the environment

443
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,270
so again from an ir or incident

444
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,480
perspective most of what occurs at the

445
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,339
active defense category is you observing

446
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,959
adversary intrusions which is what Mike

447
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:35,200
and I were talking on and everybody last

448
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,819
night about on the sort of the fireside

449
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,910
chat for those of you that attended it

450
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,560
all comes down to intrusion analysis if

451
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,839
you do it as a security operations

452
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,670
person or somebody else that's fine but

453
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,950
it really is all instant response to

454
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,680
some level because what you're doing by

455
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,180
its very nature is counterintelligence

456
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,649
some foreign adversary is doing an

457
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,599
intelligence action against you or

458
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:57,430
military you're identifying it

459
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,950
patterning it and trying to stop it in

460
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,560
the active defence category that Intel

461
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,390
is supposed to drive a better process

462
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,069
and try to make sure that our security

463
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,079
folks aren't displaying lakum all we

464
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:10,460
know in the industry that people get

465
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,379
burnt out if you can't

466
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,690
things like storyboards of water

467
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,610
actually going on and returned some

468
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,890
level of value that their job is easier

469
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:20,689
on a day to day basis you will find that

470
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,220
your security folks will get burnt out

471
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,830
and go somewhere else we have a very

472
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,960
high attrition rate in this field when

473
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,780
you don't get to see the other side of

474
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,880
the story so this to me is also a

475
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,160
defender narrative problem I see a lot

476
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,710
of organizations that say oh yeah but I

477
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,060
just took down an IP address but you

478
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,400
know what it's so simple for the

479
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,929
adversary to stay in it back up or it's

480
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,550
so simple for the adversary to do this

481
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,410
or so simple for the adversary to change

482
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,760
this or I'd route my adversary

483
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,770
infrastructure through China and look

484
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,830
like China it's super simple here's why

485
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,590
it's not your adversary is human right

486
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,929
if you've ever tried to do anything

487
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,580
inside of a government bureaucracy

488
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,290
nothing simple all right so even this

489
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,760
idea of well they're just gonna stand up

490
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,800
a new command and control infrastructure

491
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,450
yeah and it might be a change goal in

492
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,919
control process so the briefing on why

493
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,050
it occurred with the management process

494
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,030
oh are they a Western government they're

495
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,500
gonna have an RFP to see which defense

496
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,690
industrial contractors gonna bid on this

497
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,420
and so on and so on and so on it's a

498
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,400
painful process so although I spent a

499
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,440
good portion of my career on Intel in

500
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,150
defense it was a portion of my career

501
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,540
that I was on offense I was somebody's

502
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,360
apt it wasn't as glamorous as it sounds

503
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,830
and all notes that everything was far

504
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,139
more difficult than defenders like to

505
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,030
make it including myself if I were to

506
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,590
tell you why don't you have a hundred

507
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,840
percent patch ratio across your

508
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,459
organization it's this super easy we

509
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,959
would all cringe and really that's way

510
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,550
more difficult than it sounds

511
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,840
think of it from the adversaries

512
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,870
perspective as well for all the things

513
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,120
that we claim super easy for them to do

514
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,530
I'll know that your adversary is not

515
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,729
only human but they are probably dealing

516
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:57,230
still in PowerPoint

517
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:59,690
they've got management and they've got

518
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,520
metrics too so hopefully we can push

519
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,980
against those all right from a passive

520
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,810
defense perspective in terms of

521
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,330
intelligence I like our pasture defenses

522
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,790
to be better tuned based off of this

523
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,290
intelligence cycle this tends to be a

524
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,970
lot of feeds but what I don't want you

525
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,340
to get in the habit of course is just

526
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,560
driving yet another blacklist it should

527
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,720
be the output of more strategic more

528
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,419
operational level Intel to figure out

529
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,050
exactly what's useful here's my rule of

530
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,470
thumb for

531
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:30,680
putting things in your SEM firewall IDs

532
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,050
whatever else if it alerts and you

533
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,040
cannot answer questions off what the

534
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:39,260
data is don't use it alright so if you

535
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,990
get like this magic IOC from a grizzly

536
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,310
step report or something and it says

537
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,500
contact your network administrator when

538
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,510
this alerts like that's not context it's

539
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,250
not an indicator it's just another data

540
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,720
point and you'll never be able to

541
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,670
determine like is it really a false

542
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,140
positive well maybe this is that one

543
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,160
threat I was supposed to pull on and

544
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,560
I'll find the Russians

545
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,300
if you can't ask questions of your data

546
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,830
it should never go in your products in

547
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,510
the first place because one day it's

548
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,980
gonna alert and you're gonna have to

549
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,020
answer questions and it's gonna take you

550
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,460
seven days or more of resources to

551
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,330
figure out it was a false positive and

552
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,860
the off email server all right so

553
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,990
architecture so this one's a little bit

554
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:17,750
more risky I was trying to find a non

555
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:21,380
offensive atomic bomb picture so this is

556
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,600
a test one why the atomic bomb an

557
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,210
architecture here we go here's the big

558
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,459
leap I'm gonna make because you as an

559
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,010
organization especially from a small to

560
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,450
medium-sized organization based off of

561
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,310
your understanding of your threat

562
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,040
landscape and the Intel that you're

563
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:39,139
consuming you may decide that you want

564
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,030
to have all of your architecture under

565
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,920
your control or you might actually

566
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,000
decide to move it to the cloud yeah

567
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,930
clever I got it all right

568
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,420
so the cloud can be a nuclear hormone

569
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,530
place or it could actually be pretty

570
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,910
good for small to medium sized

571
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,580
organizations as their entire

572
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,140
architecture model everybody doesn't

573
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,840
need to stand up an enterprise security

574
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,370
team in an enterprise Intel team I find

575
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,110
that this is actually an appropriate

576
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,179
solution for a majority of the community

577
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,679
but your intelligence also can help you

578
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,170
prioritize what you're doing with your

579
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,750
architecture I don't like the intel's

580
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,220
teams to be focused on vulnerabilities

581
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,870
in my opinion it's the one place I

582
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,610
wouldn't put an Intel team is the

583
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,260
vulnerability management group I can't

584
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,490
tell you where your should fit based off

585
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,500
your requirements but the one place

586
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,180
that's wrong in my opinion is the

587
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,120
vulnerability management group because

588
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,350
you will always be focused on

589
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,000
vulnerabilities are the threats when

590
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:30,260
they're not they're an opportunity for

591
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,930
the adversary to leverage in the

592
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,000
adversary the human is the threats but

593
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,820
in output of what you're doing can

594
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,900
absolutely be prioritizing

595
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,340
all the different vulnerabilities the

596
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,040
environment to say you know what these

597
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,959
three are really important based off the

598
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,760
adversaries that we're seeing that are

599
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,980
in our threat model and these three are

600
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,480
likely to be implemented at some level

601
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,250
or used at some level we should

602
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,630
prioritize it the patching across the

603
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,690
organization all right

604
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,600
big picture anyone know this location a

605
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,850
little bit more history trivia yeah

606
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,850
Coventry alright so what happened with

607
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,740
Coventry and this is like half British

608
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,610
conspiracy theory a lot of people

609
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,150
believe it to be true I think it

610
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:13,939
probably is but very controversial

611
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:16,100
during World War two there was a point

612
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,160
when the Allies had the Enigma machine

613
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,929
to break out the German encryption and

614
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,210
they were aware of an attack that was

615
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,880
going to occur on Coventry and the story

616
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:28,340
goes that the decision was made by

617
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,590
Winston Churchill not to position any

618
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,780
defenses because the adversary would

619
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,250
then learn about the Enigma machine it

620
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,320
would burn the sources and methods and

621
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,260
there would be massive loss of human

622
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,960
life after the fact but that's a hard

623
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,430
decision right it was much more

624
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,650
difficult than decisions you and I have

625
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,470
to make on a regular basis and it led to

626
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,850
massive casualties but potentially

627
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,070
turned the tide of the war that they

628
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,870
didn't give up that source of method we

629
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,129
generally won't be in that big of a

630
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,649
consideration we're consuming

631
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,630
intelligence but I do want you to note

632
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,280
that that intelligence gain loss is a

633
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,930
question you have to ask ahead of time

634
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,870
like how far are we gonna let this

635
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:08,510
intrusion go and learn from it and from

636
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:11,149
a consumption standpoint in my opinion

637
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,220
you don't ever get to this point if you

638
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,840
don't have a generation team in other

639
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,330
words if you yourself aren't generating

640
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,250
intelligence there's no reason to let

641
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,960
the adversaries román your environment

642
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,460
on the hope that an instant responder

643
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,990
later on is gonna get the data and turn

644
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,360
it into better intelligence for years so

645
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,350
on intelligence gain loss it's a thing

646
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,290
that trips up a lot of people in the

647
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,969
community my rule of thumb you can't do

648
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,440
it without a team that's actually

649
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,630
focused solely on generating

650
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,150
intelligence not consuming it all right

651
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,980
so as we move on and start rolling this

652
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,680
down we have a little Bobby here what is

653
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,970
cyber attribution well true attribution

654
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,770
is the identification of a person

655
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,320
organization or country responsibility

656
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:51,440
attacks so unmasking the bad guys yeah

657
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,110
what does that do for network security

658
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,640
my position here traditionally is that

659
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,679
attribution can be very interesting for

660
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,230
executives strategic level choices

661
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,730
international agreements a lot of value

662
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,950
in attribution particular potentially

663
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,000
true attribution in your environment

664
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:10,550
especially from a tactical perspective

665
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,900
does you no good if I tell you China's

666
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,590
in your network and you start thinking

667
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,790
Oh

668
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,500
intellectual property because that's

669
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,170
what they've heard over and over again

670
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,070
China steals intellectual property

671
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,930
you've missed the fact that they also

672
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,629
have data deletion teams they also have

673
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,160
espionage teams they also have military

674
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,010
preparation teams same thing with the

675
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,080
Russians Iranians Americans

676
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,940
everybody's got every team but

677
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,129
ultimately what happens is your security

678
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,960
folks get biased based off what they've

679
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,880
heard before and they respond

680
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,290
differently thinking they understand the

681
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,810
threat when they likely don't understand

682
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,180
that threat so I do like the made-up

683
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,679
name this glowing unicorn sparkling

684
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,670
panda whatever the crap they come up

685
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,790
with

686
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,350
I generally like some name associated

687
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,200
say there's a human threat and all of

688
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:56,120
this intrusion data is this human threat

689
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,500
but not necessarily what nation it is so

690
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,719
if your intelligence requirement is

691
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,850
let's do attribution and you aren't

692
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,130
doing the entire rest of the scale down

693
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,419
before offense you're never gonna get

694
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,730
there and it's not going to return the

695
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,920
value you think it will all right so

696
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,510
from that intelligence process in terms

697
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,580
of generating intelligence this is a

698
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:16,700
model that I use to sort of guide the

699
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,169
discussion a bit in my opinion if you're

700
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,270
generating intelligence again you're

701
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,010
doing intrusion analysis and that is a

702
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,470
natural occurrence between active

703
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,600
defense and Intel on the active defense

704
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,100
side you're in some level doing network

705
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,929
security monitoring instant response

706
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,570
forensics things in your environments

707
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,280
that are an active offense and the data

708
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,200
that's collected is passed over to the

709
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,000
intelligence side of the house the

710
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,610
intelligence teams are using kill chain

711
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,470
and diamond model type analysis to

712
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,139
extract out patterns across all this

713
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,550
intrusion data and then drive it back to

714
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,500
the active defense side of the house

715
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,180
consuming intelligence which better

716
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,590
drives the hunting which better drives

717
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,900
the incident response which better

718
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,760
drives the threat analysis this natural

719
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,770
back-and-forth process is one of the

720
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,900
ways that I sort of view from that

721
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,420
tactical technical perspective of what

722
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,600
we do is Intel analysts

723
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:06,790
that also means that I do think as a

724
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,679
requirement to generate intelligence you

725
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,149
need some sort of sock and some sort of

726
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,970
instant response team

727
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,890
now for those of you that are like well

728
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,790
strategic I'm focused on geopolitical I

729
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,380
agree

730
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,399
strategic is the way to go we want the

731
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,200
community to be there but if you're

732
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,730
focused solely on geopolitical you've

733
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,130
got to get the intrusion data somewhere

734
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,840
because that's what rises up to make

735
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,670
that strategic level analysis even if

736
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,620
you're just consuming it from others so

737
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,900
if your response is I'm just gonna

738
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,090
consume everybody else's reports and do

739
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,680
analysis off that you're still in threat

740
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,899
intelligence consumption land you're not

741
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,730
really generating out intelligence if

742
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,410
you're generating intelligence based off

743
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,450
of what you're seeing it still comes

744
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,640
from the number one foundational step

745
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,680
which is an intrusion all right

746
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,080
so understand your organization first so

747
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,850
a little tips for you about Intel if you

748
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,290
are an intelligence team I first want

749
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,449
you to understand what your organization

750
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,300
does what is the business line what is

751
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,830
the value that it returns make sure that

752
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,389
you can look to history to understand

753
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,220
the past intrusions and data that you

754
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,380
have I want you to understand your

755
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,970
organization so well that if someone

756
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,710
told you something that was wrong about

757
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,750
your organization or what they do you

758
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,580
spot it like Mark Hamill in World War

759
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,700
two like you should be able to pull out

760
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,530
that Mark Hamill did not fly the Angola

761
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,520
gay Luke Skywalker wasn't there you

762
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,889
should be able to pick that out very

763
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,120
quickly internal to your organization in

764
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,050
the same way understand your

765
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,600
capabilities

766
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,240
I want my intelligence team analysts to

767
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,919
know the questions that they're asking

768
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:33,190
are supported by the architecture and

769
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,490
teams in place as an example if you have

770
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,560
the 74 Z speeder bike from Star Wars for

771
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,090
your intelligence team that's awesome

772
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,530
but if it actually wasn't one of your

773
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,780
capabilities I don't want your

774
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:45,520
executives to ask you questions that you

775
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,040
can't answer so what does that translate

776
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,230
out to be if your intelligence

777
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,120
requirement is identify the threats that

778
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,800
we faced over the past six months and

779
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,570
you've got seven days of logs in your

780
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,580
environment your capabilities don't

781
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,960
match our intelligence requirements so

782
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,490
figure out what your security

783
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,040
capabilities are along that sliding

784
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,080
scale and make sure that as you sort of

785
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,940
read team it out in your mind that your

786
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,159
intelligence requirements match up to

787
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,060
what you can actually produce it's like

788
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,460
the big

789
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:13,990
point on generating intelligence next

790
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,360
articulate good intelligence

791
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,100
requirements generally speaking you

792
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:20,679
don't need a giant hammer or star

793
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,500
destroyer to actually go after small

794
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,340
cities or small requirements what I mean

795
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,900
by that is is your biggest challenge in

796
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,750
the organization the fact that it

797
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,910
currently takes 45 days to scope your

798
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,170
environment with an indicator and you're

799
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,850
trying to spin up a team to do

800
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,070
intelligence generation for the purpose

801
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,649
of attribution you've got other problems

802
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,879
you've got other things and it turns out

803
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,140
you might actually just be able to

804
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,720
consume intelligence to be able to meet

805
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,550
that requirements it is actually not as

806
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,710
difficult as you might think as well to

807
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,790
identify Star Wars related World War two

808
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,550
pictures it turns out there's whole

809
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,649
albums of them I wasted a good hour and

810
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,139
a half last night just looking at the

811
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,060
Star Wars pictures anyways in terms of

812
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,710
focusing on relieving pain points I'm

813
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:06,100
telling you there's lots all right from

814
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:08,950
a pain points perspective I like my

815
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,659
Intel teams to be service oriented what

816
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,490
I mean by that is you want to make sure

817
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,800
they don't become that self licking ice

818
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:18,400
cream cone if you tell your Intel team

819
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,980
go generate Intel they will do it it'll

820
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,470
be useless you won't actually be able to

821
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,300
have any derived value whatsoever but

822
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,400
man they're gonna spin up and generate

823
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,040
Intel because that's what Intel analysts

824
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,780
do without good requirements without

825
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,070
being service-oriented it'll cost you a

826
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,139
lot of money so what a service-oriented

827
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:38,320
to me means it means that when I stand

828
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:41,230
up an Intel team or when I ask for like

829
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,000
stock moving into Intel I expect to get

830
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,220
no value out of an Intel team for the

831
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,690
first six months I say all right we're

832
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,640
gonna hire people we're gonna put them

833
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:49,510
the position also a very unpopular

834
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,730
position

835
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,470
I don't agree in big budgets either for

836
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:55,600
the first six months usually for the

837
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,830
first year I want my Intel analyst to go

838
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,709
out and figure out what's open-source

839
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:01,689
what's available what can they use and

840
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,060
then make a cost justification for what

841
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,580
they're going to get in terms of vendor

842
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,720
products and feeds why number one I want

843
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,939
them to understand the science behind

844
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,670
what they're doing so they don't just go

845
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,530
when I push this vendor X button I get

846
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,090
Intel no no where is it coming from oh

847
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,750
they're just doing passive DNS lookups

848
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,100
okay thank you all so I want them to be

849
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:23,200
able to justify what they're doing in

850
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,889
terms of cost the organization at some

851
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,780
point the budget

852
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,040
is going to get smaller it will happen

853
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,320
even if it hasn't happened to you yet

854
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,399
and something's going to be removed from

855
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,560
your environment you're gonna have to

856
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,320
lose a tool lose a feed lose a product

857
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,419
at that point I want them to understand

858
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,740
how much it costs them or what the

859
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,940
effort was or what intelligence

860
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,790
requirements they couldn't fulfill

861
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,410
without that product and what its gonna

862
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,720
cost the organization to get rid of it

863
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,400
so as an example if you've got this four

864
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,170
hundred thousand dollar your Intel tool

865
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,640
seems really expensive it might be the

866
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,010
first thing on the budget to get ripped

867
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,540
off but if it's the only way that you're

868
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,970
doing intelligence requirements to meet

869
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,250
the CEO level tasks it's probably a good

870
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:01,630
investment right so figuring out exactly

871
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,860
what your capabilities and what your

872
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,260
intelligence requirements are to be that

873
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,179
service oriented component is useful

874
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,830
also I like taking my Intel folks

875
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,350
injecting them in every business unit

876
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,730
what is the chief marketing officer what

877
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,080
is the chief financial officer what is

878
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,040
the legal team what is the acquisitions

879
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,649
team what is the procurement team

880
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,120
getting out of Intel if the answer is I

881
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,070
don't know you're not generating

882
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,290
intelligence your organization you're

883
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,990
throwing i OCS at another Chinese threat

884
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:28,149
what I want you to focus on is speaking

885
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,610
the language of those other business

886
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,160
units do I know that from a procurement

887
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:34,929
standpoint that right now we're looking

888
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,480
at acquiring other companies and

889
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:39,640
adopting their risk model adopting their

890
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,550
threat model and that's gonna impact the

891
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,220
cost of onboarding them stealing

892
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,020
Sergio's term the cost of onboarding

893
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,870
your adversaries right because that's

894
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,129
all you're doing is adopting them what

895
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:52,300
is that going to cost us because that

896
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,430
might make a difference in the

897
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:57,100
acquisition price or process of

898
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,600
validating them so Intel analysts to

899
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,060
every other business unit in the

900
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,100
organization coming back speaking their

901
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:05,200
language after six months being able to

902
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,600
generate good requirements for those

903
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,520
teams because every team sucks at

904
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,020
generating intelligence requirements you

905
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,180
were going to have to generate it for

906
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,800
them you're gonna take it to them you're

907
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,960
gonna say is this what I am actually

908
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,730
doing for you that you like they're

909
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,380
gonna respond generally that sounds

910
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:22,240
great or that doesn't sound pretty good

911
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,290
at all you're gonna go back and forth

912
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,760
and you're going to really get that

913
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:27,760
intelligence requirement done correctly

914
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,190
it's going to be painful it is the most

915
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,379
important thing you will do all right

916
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,840
prioritize your threat model if you're

917
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,730
preparing for the landing of Normandy

918
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,730
and troops coming off the beaches and it

919
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,410
turns out it's just ran

920
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,810
somewhere and your organization's

921
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,750
biggest thing is ransomware you don't

922
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,280
need to also prioritize 80 80s walking

923
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:49,070
on the beaches belong up your defenses

924
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,960
in other words not everybody is going to

925
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,730
face all the apts

926
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,320
you don't have to invest in another

927
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:57,410
product or feed because someone told you

928
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,270
yeah but here's what APD 28 and 29 are

929
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,780
doing against the election

930
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:04,910
are we election systems no do they fit

931
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,230
in our threat model no ok cool you guys

932
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,280
figure it out we're gonna go focus on

933
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,860
the threats that are actually impacting

934
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,230
our organization so prioritize to your

935
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,419
threat model this is going to lead

936
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:16,520
eventually to you missing something

937
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,320
eventually something outside your threat

938
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,410
model is going to cost your organization

939
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,389
significantly you need the maturity and

940
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,700
trust between the executives and the

941
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,640
security teams and yourself to say you

942
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,200
know what that is OK we prioritized our

943
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,020
threat model based off of what we

944
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,960
understood we now have a learning moment

945
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,030
to do a little bit better but it's ok

946
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,340
that we missed that because look at all

947
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:42,230
the other coverage we have and we will

948
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,850
absolutely now add that to our threat

949
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,220
model if you'd like so it's an evolving

950
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,260
process

951
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,420
keep up the requirements there's a

952
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,190
difference between doing b-17s and be 47

953
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,500
bombers and having X wings flying along

954
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:57,320
the side of you what I mean by that is

955
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,730
very simple if you are in an

956
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,200
organization and you are getting all

957
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,060
that sliding scale of cybersecurity

958
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,220
discussion until it each phase and

959
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,470
things in life are good to fulfill your

960
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,900
requirements you probably don't need an

961
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,340
intelligence generation team simple as

962
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,660
that if you're doing all the

963
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,010
requirements based along the four

964
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,020
categories of the scale that I want you

965
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,210
to focus on and up to the strategic

966
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,360
level everything is good that's

967
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,130
perfectly fine to consume if you find

968
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,840
that there's more and more and more

969
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,250
legitimate intelligence requirements and

970
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,830
you just can't keep up with them

971
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,960
you have to enforce an actual

972
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,819
intelligence generation team inside of

973
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,949
your organization and be able to display

974
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,950
the value in the cost that it's going to

975
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:39,439
be expensive it is not a simple like one

976
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:42,109
more team generating intelligence as we

977
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,620
all should know is extremely extremely

978
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,820
expensive over time so as a matter you

979
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,900
know open-source tools and things can

980
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,460
make it better but everyone always

981
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,320
forgets the human analysts call

982
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,360
and the training and the maintenance and

983
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,890
the health care packages eventually it's

984
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,690
going to be extremely expensive for them

985
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:58,430
you must have key players I'll try to

986
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,680
figure out a way to get him in here and

987
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,080
the Star Wars pictures didn't quite go

988
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,690
but here's your connection Christopher

989
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,310
de leeuw is the sort of same gentleman

990
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,820
from the left to the right Christopher

991
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,680
Lee was a World War 2 era sort of

992
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,000
Special Forces member for those of you

993
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,410
that haven't sort of dug into his

994
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,350
history he's literally the most

995
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,700
interesting man in the world even on the

996
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,850
set of Lord of the Rings he was trying

997
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,799
to explain like stabbing scenes and and

998
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,170
Peter Jackson was like well when you

999
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
stab somebody in this one like pivotal

1000
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,160
scene in Lord of the Rings spoiler

1001
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,259
alerts for those you stabbed this person

1002
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,210
I need him to make some sort of gasping

1003
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:36,920
sound Chris really is like no no no no

1004
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,150
here's what he the sound he's actually

1005
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,410
gonna make and they're like how would

1006
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,940
you know that it's like oh I've killed a

1007
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,589
lot of people this way so we're gonna do

1008
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:47,090
it this way in the film is like

1009
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:48,590
that like my point in saying this is you

1010
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,570
had to have key players when you're

1011
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:52,910
consuming it is entirely appropriate to

1012
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:54,590
rely on the vendor community mmm we have

1013
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,060
a love-hate relationship usually but not

1014
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,240
so much with the vendors what the vendor

1015
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,770
sales teams but generally speaking

1016
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,020
products and services and feeds and

1017
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,850
reports you can do a lot in consumption

1018
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,860
if you're gonna generate you can't

1019
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:10,100
really buy that capability so much as

1020
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,540
having key players no other process in

1021
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,720
your organization is going to be as

1022
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:19,370
analysts dependent as generating Intel

1023
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:23,299
team if you have a single key player you

1024
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,920
probably should not stand up a team that

1025
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,390
person is eventually gonna leave or get

1026
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,710
hit by a bus or something other right

1027
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,290
and you're gonna have a very expensive

1028
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:33,230
Intel program I generally like to see

1029
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,779
consumption moving to Intel generation

1030
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:37,820
finding that key player first process is

1031
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,530
building at a team structuring training

1032
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,620
internal documentation processes all the

1033
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,970
process and if you're able to do all the

1034
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,500
process and documentation and how the

1035
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,339
Intel sort of training is gonna take

1036
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,260
place and how we're gonna get that

1037
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,730
analyst spun up and then you land with

1038
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,890
three or four analysts that are key

1039
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,360
players that's when you can go ahead and

1040
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,100
make that determination that I can do an

1041
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,960
intelligence generation team because

1042
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,750
otherwise what will happen is no matter

1043
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,330
how badass your Christopher Lee is it is

1044
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,140
still one thought process and you never

1045
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,400
want one

1046
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,839
thought process when generating

1047
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,250
intelligence requirements and when

1048
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,200
generating intelligence off those

1049
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:13,010
requirements you will get very very

1050
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,779
biased perspectives I am a white guy

1051
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:16,760
from Alabama who served in the Air Force

1052
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,980
then in an intelligence agency nobody

1053
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,640
likes me more and focus a lot on ICS

1054
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:25,100
holy crap I have a lot of bias on me no

1055
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,029
matter how much I try to defeat it I am

1056
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,830
biased by a lot of things so if it's

1057
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:32,960
just me driving the Intel in that

1058
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,700
company it's going to have a flavor on

1059
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,350
it that might drive my company in the

1060
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,960
wrong direction you need a very

1061
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:42,410
competitive analyst process so with that

1062
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,570
as we run at a time here also Alan

1063
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:46,009
Turing you can't like not mention Turing

1064
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,590
in a world war 2 presentation by the way

1065
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,700
I like this quote here we're not

1066
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,380
interested in the fact that the brain

1067
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,359
has the consistency of cold porridge at

1068
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,800
the time people were arguing with him

1069
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,700
about well it's an art versus science

1070
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,410
and you can't make a thinking machine

1071
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,270
because the brain is so complex you

1072
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,370
can't make it you just can't do this you

1073
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:06,380
can't formalize this it's not a thinking

1074
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:07,910
machine and when he tried to explain how

1075
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,110
we could people were like oh yeah yeah

1076
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,629
but if you can explain it it's not

1077
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:13,070
thinking and his point was well we don't

1078
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,990
seem to mind that the brain is just a

1079
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,850
bowl of cold porridge yeah we're all

1080
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,250
convinced about its thinking capability

1081
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,500
I can do it with a machine so here's my

1082
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:24,290
pushback to you all you're gonna run

1083
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,080
across the dialog that it's all art not

1084
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:29,330
science and I call a lot of

1085
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,400
what we do that we call art is just non

1086
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:33,470
formalized processes that we feel

1087
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,120
comfortable with you are going to be

1088
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,830
able to formalize the processes I would

1089
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,270
use the sliding scale to get started in

1090
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,880
terms of where you're actually doing

1091
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:43,340
intelligence move it up to strategic and

1092
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,170
as you get more requirements build out

1093
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,670
your intelligence generation team make

1094
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:49,190
sure you have more than one person doing

1095
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,470
that that is your formalized process

1096
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:53,630
it's one sample approach to yours may be

1097
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:56,980
different that's one sample approach to

1098
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,980
how to meet those requirements for you

1099
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,929
